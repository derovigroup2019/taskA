1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:02,101
- Maggie.
- My father,

2
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:03,736
he's gonna bring Maggie
back to life.

3
00:00:05,273 --> 00:00:07,574
Maggie? Hey, sorry.

4
00:00:07,576 --> 00:00:10,009
- You okay?
- I'm alive, so...

5
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:11,911
yes?

6
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:17,120
Remember when you asked

7
00:00:17,122 --> 00:00:18,688
if we could stop it?

8
00:00:19,724 --> 00:00:21,290
All the evil
in the world?

9
00:00:27,132 --> 00:00:29,265
Well, maybe with Jack,
we can.

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,405
Maybe you're right.

11
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:39,342
But then
what will we do?

12
00:00:39,344 --> 00:00:40,977
Dean?

13
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:43,146
We had a deal!

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,582
Michael.

15
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:48,050
Thanks for the suit.

16
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:49,886
I appreciate you
accepting my invitation.

17
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:52,855
I'm the leader
of a werewolf pack.

18
00:00:52,857 --> 00:00:55,057
Why on Earth would an archangel
care about us?

19
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:57,593
- Isn't it time you had your due?
- Our due?

20
00:00:57,595 --> 00:01:00,229
There are ways
to enhance your...

21
00:01:00,231 --> 00:01:02,064
let's call them
talents.

22
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:04,267
And these ways are...

23
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,302
Fully tested.

24
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,738
Yes.

25
00:01:12,744 --> 00:01:15,845
There were some misfires early.
I will admit to that.

26
00:01:15,847 --> 00:01:18,314
But I have
cracked the code.

27
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:20,950
Do you propose we wage a war
on the humans?

28
00:01:20,952 --> 00:01:22,885
Why be the hunted...

29
00:01:22,887 --> 00:01:24,854
when you can be
the hunter?

30
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:16,239
Hey, guys.

31
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:18,674
Okay, so here we are

32
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:21,310
in delightful
Claremore, Oklahoma.

33
00:02:23,014 --> 00:02:26,015
According to the post,
that's where it came from.

34
00:02:26,017 --> 00:02:28,851
I'm thinking ghoul.

35
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:30,319
Anyway...

36
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:33,723
...here we go.

40
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,987
I know homework sucks,
but it get it down --

41
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:39,388
all of it.

42
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,625
The more we know,
the better we are, so...

43
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,463
Uh...

44
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,901
Everybody good?
Any questions?

45
00:03:51,903 --> 00:03:55,438
Okay.
Let's get to work.

46
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,106
You kids
have fun out there.

47
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:02,311
- Don't even say it. - What?
- No, it's good.

48
00:04:02,313 --> 00:04:04,180
It's got, like, a very
camp-counselor vibe to it.

49
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:06,449
Just need
to get you a whistle.

50
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:08,017
What is that?

51
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:10,586
It's nothing. It's just...

52
00:04:10,588 --> 00:04:11,921
Hunter check-ins.

53
00:04:11,923 --> 00:04:13,456
- Check-ins?
- Yeah.

54
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,291
That's adorable.

55
00:04:19,864 --> 00:04:22,765
You got any rest lately,
like at all?

56
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,402
I mean, look, man, I know things
are crazy right now, okay?

57
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:27,770
I mean, hell, I just
went toe-to-toe

58
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:29,972
with my own personal
horror-movie icon,

59
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:31,216
but we all need
our beauty sleep.

60
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:33,142
Dean, I have 16 Hunters
on cases right now.

61
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:34,910
That's not counting Jack
and Cass in Sarasota

62
00:04:34,912 --> 00:04:37,213
or Mom and Bobby working
that rugaru in Texas.

63
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:39,882
Okay, you know that these people
survived a war, right?

64
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:41,884
Yeah, but a war
isn't Hunting.

65
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:46,622
These people need, uh, lore
and weapons and tips

66
00:04:46,624 --> 00:04:48,290
and backup, and --

67
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:50,693
Look, don't worry
about me, all right?

68
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:52,294
I'm -- I'm --
I'm good.

69
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:55,064
What is it?

70
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:57,633
One of the Hunters,
uh, missed check-in.

71
00:04:57,635 --> 00:04:58,968
Who?

72
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,469
Maggie.

73
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:11,013
Come on, kid,
answer the phone.

74
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:17,520
You got them
wearing body cams now?

75
00:05:17,522 --> 00:05:19,021
Yeah, they're new.

76
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:21,290
I figured watching each other
Hunt is the best way to learn.

77
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:24,160
<i>Okay, so --</i>
They upload
directly to the server.

78
00:05:24,162 --> 00:05:27,229
<i>...in delightful</i>
<i>Claremore, Oklahoma.</i>

79
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:28,864
And if something
goes wrong,

80
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:31,133
you got
a place to start.

81
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:33,769
Yeah. That, too.

82
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:35,137
<i>Here we go.</i>

83
00:05:47,084 --> 00:05:49,218
Something jumped her.

84
00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:54,657
The ghoul?

85
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:55,991
Dean, if she's hurt
or dead --

86
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:57,193
We don't know
that, okay?

87
00:05:57,195 --> 00:05:58,928
We don't know
anything yet.

88
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:02,164
You just watched
the same thing I did.

89
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,499
I saw a ghoul, okay?

90
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:05,167
And, yeah, they're nasty
little sons of bitches,

91
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:06,902
but they're
also scavengers.

92
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:08,404
They don't usually
feed on the living.

93
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:11,140
- Yeah, so why attack her?
- I don't know.

94
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:12,641
But I bet if we go there
and find out,

95
00:06:12,643 --> 00:06:14,210
we got a shot
at bringing her home.

96
00:06:25,756 --> 00:06:28,624
- So, what's the deal here?
- I don't know.

97
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:30,860
- Same family owns the whole place.
- Huh.

98
00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:32,995
Private cemetery.
Must be nice.

99
00:06:32,997 --> 00:06:35,130
- What?
- As in convenient.

100
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:36,599
But what are we talking here?
Are they some sort of

101
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:38,534
weirdo shut-ins
like the Addams Family?

102
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:40,569
Uh, Maggie
was working a lead.

103
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:42,371
Kids online said
they were studying when --

104
00:06:42,373 --> 00:06:44,406
and I quote -- "a walker
tried to end them."

105
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:45,908
It's a zombie --
a "Walking Dead" thing.

106
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,410
I know what
a walker is, Sam.

107
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:50,179
- "Studying," huh?
- Yeah.

108
00:07:19,243 --> 00:07:20,943
Hey,
check it out.

109
00:07:22,947 --> 00:07:24,980
Drag marks.

110
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:26,582
But no blood,

111
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:29,418
which means Maggie
could still be alive.

112
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,920
Ghouls don't
take prisoners.

113
00:07:30,922 --> 00:07:33,222
Okay, say that
she surprised it,

114
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:35,090
it attacked,

115
00:07:35,092 --> 00:07:40,462
and then took her somewhere
to feed for later, right?

116
00:07:40,464 --> 00:07:42,731
Maybe it didn't
finish the job yet.

117
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:44,700
Either way,
I say we find it --

118
00:07:44,702 --> 00:07:46,635
- And kill it.
- Yeah.

119
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:49,638
Hello?
Who's down there?

120
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:55,377
All right,
we're coming up.

121
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:56,712
Hey!

122
00:07:56,714 --> 00:07:58,213
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

123
00:07:58,215 --> 00:08:00,149
Yeah. I'm -- I'm Mr. Harrison.
This is Mr. Byrne.

124
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:02,518
We're with the
Historic Preservation Society.

125
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,919
This is
private property.

126
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:05,354
Sure. Uh,
the city sent us.

127
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:07,456
They -- They are gonna
make this whole place

128
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,692
a historic site.
- Yeah. Yeah.

129
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:11,293
We just need to take
a look around, uh,

130
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:13,996
survey the grounds,
and then the home.

131
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,499
I-If we could just
speak with the owner.

132
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:19,201
Hm.

133
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:23,505
Follow me.

134
00:08:25,576 --> 00:08:27,309
I knew it!
I always said

135
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:29,278
this place had
historical significance.

136
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,347
- So much significance.
- Thought so.

137
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:33,349
Oh, please.

138
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:35,050
I'm no expert.

139
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:37,119
I do subscribe
to <i>Architectural Digest.</i>

140
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:39,288
Oh, is that right?

141
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,824
The thing is...

142
00:08:41,826 --> 00:08:43,859
...how many of you
does this take?

143
00:08:43,861 --> 00:08:46,528
I mean, two of you
seems like enough.

144
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,864
Two of us?

145
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:50,199
Your colleagues?

146
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:52,101
Well, they got here
right before you did --

147
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:53,969
said they were
from the H.P.S., too.

148
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:55,771
Really?
Y--

149
00:09:00,544 --> 00:09:03,012
You gotta
be kidding me.

150
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:05,047
Hello, boys.

151
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,017
What are you
doing here?

152
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:10,285
Oh, no.
Was there a mix-up?

153
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:11,553
No. Not at all.

154
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:12,755
We --
W-We're all good.

155
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:14,490
We, uh, just wish

156
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:17,192
you'd checked in
with the main office

157
00:09:17,194 --> 00:09:19,228
before coming
all the way out here.

158
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,896
Well, we don't
need permission

159
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:22,431
to look at houses.

160
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:25,134
Especially
when the main office

161
00:09:25,136 --> 00:09:27,736
is run by a bunch
of idjits.

162
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:32,808
I really hope this won't
affect our chances

163
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,044
of being
historically preserved.

164
00:09:35,046 --> 00:09:37,479
Could you just
give us a minute?

165
00:09:41,585 --> 00:09:44,453
So, uh, Neil, right?

166
00:09:44,455 --> 00:09:47,189
How long is the house
been in your family?

167
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:48,924
Oh. No.

168
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:50,626
I can see why
you think that.

169
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:51,927
I'm...I'm flattered.

170
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:53,662
I'm not the owner.

171
00:09:53,664 --> 00:09:55,197
Oh, that'd be
Mr. Rawling.

172
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,099
I'm his nurse.

173
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:58,434
Oh.

174
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:02,705
We're gonna need
to talk to him.

175
00:10:02,707 --> 00:10:04,540
Mm.

176
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:06,175
It was
her first solo Hunt,

177
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:09,812
and she was
nervous, excited.

178
00:10:09,814 --> 00:10:11,547
Bobby and I were talking her
through it,

179
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:13,615
giving her pointers,
and then all of a sudden,

180
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:15,084
she just
stopped texting.

181
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:17,486
We were worried,
but we should have called.

182
00:10:17,488 --> 00:10:20,289
No, it's...

183
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,257
Did you
find anything?

184
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:25,094
Mr. Harrison, a word.

185
00:10:33,704 --> 00:10:35,537
Is it just me or
does this guy look exactly --

186
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:37,706
No, that's him,
from the video.

187
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:41,143
So, if he's here,
where's Maggie?

188
00:10:42,313 --> 00:10:44,113
Help me.

189
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:54,923
Somebody...

190
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:56,425
ple--

191
00:10:56,427 --> 00:10:58,093
Help me.

192
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:06,434
Mr. Rawling.

193
00:11:06,436 --> 00:11:08,169
Groundskeeper found him
like this.

194
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:09,704
He had a stroke.

195
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:11,206
I'm doing my best to keep him
comfortable, but --

196
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,942
Neil?
Give me a hand?

197
00:11:13,944 --> 00:11:15,277
In here!

198
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,946
Sasha --
Mr. Rawling's daughter.

199
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:22,651
Sasha,
they're from

200
00:11:22,653 --> 00:11:24,953
the National Historic
Preservation Society.

201
00:11:24,955 --> 00:11:26,421
Isn't that exciting?

202
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:30,859
What?

203
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:33,929
<i>This</i> house?

204
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:35,130
You're sure?

205
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:37,532
Yeah, she's, uh...
she's got good bones.

206
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:39,801
Ah. My grandpa
used to say that

207
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:42,237
when he and my grandma
lived here.

208
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:45,340
Now, your father -- how long
has he lived here?

209
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:47,876
Full-time?

210
00:11:47,878 --> 00:11:49,344
I don't really know.

211
00:11:49,346 --> 00:11:51,813
- You don't know?
- Look, I just came down here

212
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:53,548
to get everything
in order before he...

213
00:11:54,785 --> 00:11:56,451
Well, before he dies.

214
00:11:57,521 --> 00:12:01,022
Look, it's -- it's been
a really long week.

215
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:03,058
Sure. Sorry, um...

216
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,659
We'll just take a second,
and we'll be out of your hair.

217
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:06,494
You know what?
I can't. Not today.

218
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:09,397
So, I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to leave.

219
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:12,467
Well, it ain't
a ghoul.

220
00:12:12,469 --> 00:12:15,090
I checked the old guy out
pretty good back there -- no bites.

221
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,404
Maybe we're looking
at a shifter.

222
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:18,206
I don't know.
Shifters don't usually

223
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,575
hang out in graveyards.
- Maybe he was possessed,

224
00:12:20,577 --> 00:12:24,245
you know, or maybe a demon
took his body for a joyride?

225
00:12:24,247 --> 00:12:25,714
Yeah,
and then what?

226
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:27,048
He tucks him
back in

227
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,751
like he's returning
a library book?

228
00:12:29,753 --> 00:12:31,486
Anyways, I spritzed him
with holy water

229
00:12:31,488 --> 00:12:33,288
when the nurse's head
was turned.

230
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,424
This case obviously
ain't a milk run.

231
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:37,792
Something on
your mind, Bobby?

232
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:39,527
Yeah.
Your brother.

233
00:12:40,464 --> 00:12:41,963
He let Maggie come here

234
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:44,566
when she had no idea what
she was walking into.

235
00:12:46,436 --> 00:12:49,070
She wasn't ready.

236
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:51,239
Oh, c'mon, when is
anybody ever ready?

237
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:52,774
You are or you ain't.

238
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:55,710
A real leader would've
seen that a mile a way.

239
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:57,278
Bobby.

240
00:12:59,216 --> 00:13:01,850
Look, we all want
the same thing.

241
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:04,786
We -- We have a job to do,
so let's do it.

242
00:13:05,922 --> 00:13:07,489
Sam,
you're with me.

243
00:13:07,491 --> 00:13:09,557
Bobby,
you're with Dean.

244
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:16,865
Look, don't listen
to Bobby.

245
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:18,667
Um, maybe he's right,
you know?

246
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:21,269
I encouraged her.
Maybe he's right about me,

247
00:13:21,271 --> 00:13:22,570
about everything.

248
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:23,872
Sam.

249
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:28,309
Watching you
these last few weeks,

250
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:30,612
you know what I've been
saying to myself?

251
00:13:30,614 --> 00:13:32,747
"This is what
he was born to do."

252
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:37,052
If Bobby can't
see that, then...

253
00:13:37,054 --> 00:13:39,254
it's not the only thing
he's been missing lately.

254
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:42,057
I wasn't
gonna mention it.

255
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:43,858
None of my business,
but it did seem like

256
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,095
you'd gotten
pretty close lately.

257
00:13:47,097 --> 00:13:48,897
Yeah, and
I thought so, too.

258
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,966
Maybe, but since
we've been back,

259
00:13:51,968 --> 00:13:54,135
things have changed.

260
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:56,071
Changed how?

261
00:13:56,073 --> 00:13:57,939
We're Hunting
all the time.

262
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:00,975
He won't take a break,
not even for a second.

263
00:14:00,977 --> 00:14:03,445
There's something
on his mind, and...

264
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:05,513
he doesn't want
to talk about it.

265
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:07,148
Have you asked?

266
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,250
Bobby's not open
like your dad.

267
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:10,585
Wait.

268
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:11,820
Like <i>my</i> dad?

269
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,422
Okay.

270
00:14:14,424 --> 00:14:17,258
At least he's not like
your dad was when I knew him.

271
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:19,894
Right.

272
00:14:19,896 --> 00:14:22,697
Bobby's got walls,
big ones.

273
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:25,967
I just don't know
if I can do that...

274
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:28,336
if I even ever put myself
out there again.

275
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:33,808
I shouldn't be talking
to you about this.

276
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:43,318
You think I was too hard
on your brother back there.

277
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,154
He's doing his best.
He's doing better than his best.

278
00:14:46,156 --> 00:14:47,989
You know, this whole
Hunter Five-O thing --

279
00:14:47,991 --> 00:14:49,758
he's -- he's killing
himself over it.

280
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,426
He doesn't eat,
he doesn't sleep,

281
00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:53,328
grew himself one of those
Kenny Rogers Beards.

282
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,029
No offense.

283
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:57,599
Well, I'm, uh...

284
00:14:57,601 --> 00:14:59,968
still getting
to know this Bobby.

285
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,705
Um, our Bobby wasn't
the most open person either.

286
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:06,307
Not at first.

287
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:09,711
His wife, she, uh --
she was possessed by a demon,

288
00:15:09,713 --> 00:15:12,580
and he had to
take care of it himself.

289
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:17,018
They never had
any children?

290
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,887
No.

291
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:20,388
Anyway, point is,

292
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,323
people put up walls
for a reason.

293
00:15:22,325 --> 00:15:25,727
So, whatever your Bobby
has behind his...

294
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:28,730
...doubt it's pretty.

295
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:33,835
But you think
I should try and find out?

296
00:15:33,837 --> 00:15:35,170
You know what?

297
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:38,606
If you care
about him,

298
00:15:38,608 --> 00:15:40,608
I think
you should.

299
00:15:44,714 --> 00:15:46,681
- Hey, what is...?
- What?

300
00:15:46,683 --> 00:15:49,184
Sam, look at this.

301
00:16:33,063 --> 00:16:35,363
FBI,

302
00:16:35,365 --> 00:16:37,232
DEA...

303
00:16:39,002 --> 00:16:40,501
...Forest Service.

304
00:16:47,277 --> 00:16:49,944
Looks like
a Hunter's wallet.

305
00:16:49,946 --> 00:16:52,380
Another Hunter?

306
00:16:52,382 --> 00:16:53,915
Not one of ours.

307
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,623
Bobby?

308
00:17:05,629 --> 00:17:07,095
Bobby!

309
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:20,441
The hell?

310
00:17:28,718 --> 00:17:30,385
What happened
to you?!

311
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:34,455
I could ask you
the same question.

312
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:35,790
Y--

313
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:14,062
Hello?

314
00:18:14,064 --> 00:18:15,563
Neil?

315
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:39,187
No! No!

316
00:18:57,773 --> 00:19:00,207
A thing chased me
down the hall.

317
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:01,842
What kind
of thing?

318
00:19:01,844 --> 00:19:04,078
It couldn't have been real.
It looked --

319
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,712
It looked
like a vampire.

320
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:07,981
Oh, I'm crazy.
That sounded crazy.

321
00:19:09,752 --> 00:19:11,552
You're not crazy.

322
00:19:13,923 --> 00:19:15,022
I'm sorry.

323
00:19:15,024 --> 00:19:17,624
What are you
doing in my house?

324
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:23,464
You hunt monsters?

325
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,899
What about
the Historic Society?

326
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:28,268
Uh, yeah -- Sorry.

327
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:32,072
You're not gonna believe
what I found in the shed.

328
00:19:32,074 --> 00:19:33,874
You <i>hunt</i>
monsters?

329
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:35,542
Oh, good.
You told them.

330
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:37,077
What did you
find in the shed?

331
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,445
Dead guy.

332
00:19:40,382 --> 00:19:43,617
Any chance, uh --
Any chance it was him?

333
00:19:44,987 --> 00:19:47,087
Yeah.
Yeah, that's him.

334
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:48,355
Great.

335
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:51,458
So, we think something
is killing Hunters.

336
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:54,461
Where's Bobby?

337
00:19:54,463 --> 00:19:57,097
Said he had to grab something
out of the truck.

338
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:59,399
I'll go check.

339
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:00,567
No, wait,
time out.

340
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:02,603
There's a dead body
on our property?

341
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:05,038
Yeah, that's not all.

342
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,674
A wormy clone of her dad
tried to kill me.

343
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:09,843
It was the same thing that
attacked Maggie in the video.

344
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:12,479
- W-Who's Maggie?
- But my dad is right there.

345
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:14,214
This makes no sense.

346
00:20:14,216 --> 00:20:16,483
Sasha, c-can we talk to
the Groundskeeper, please?

347
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:18,619
Don?
He left hours ago.

348
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:21,355
What about
the thing that I saw?

349
00:20:21,357 --> 00:20:23,090
Right. Yep.
S-So, she had

350
00:20:23,092 --> 00:20:25,626
a vampire chase her
down the hall.

351
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:29,296
Okay, you're right --
no sense.

352
00:20:29,298 --> 00:20:31,999
I mean, what kind of vampire
lets its dinner go AWOL?

353
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:34,368
And that thing that I killed
died weird.

354
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,836
Okay, you know what?
This is a stretch, but --

355
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:37,938
but go with me.
What if what we're dealing with,

356
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,174
what if they aren't
monsters at all?

357
00:20:40,176 --> 00:20:42,042
Oh, thank God.

358
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:43,977
All right.
Well, then what are they?

359
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:45,746
Maybe some kind of
manifestation?

360
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:47,848
Like from a witch
or a psychic?

361
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,484
Remember, uh, the -- the guy
in the old folks' home?

362
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:52,352
He could -- He could make things
go "Looney Tunes."

363
00:20:52,354 --> 00:20:54,007
Fred Jones --
Yeah, Dad's buddy.

364
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:54,556
Exactly.

365
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:56,490
He was psychokinetic.
He could reshape reality.

366
00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:59,259
Reshape?
That's not possible.

367
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:01,695
Oh, pal, you have no idea
what's possible.

368
00:21:01,697 --> 00:21:03,463
Yeah, but Fred Jones
was damn near catatonic.

369
00:21:03,465 --> 00:21:04,865
He had no idea
what he was doing.

370
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,466
Well, maybe
he doesn't either.

371
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:08,368
You think
my dad's doing this?

372
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,338
Sasha, has your dad ever shown
any signs of, um...

373
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,374
Psychic powers?
There's -- No. No.

374
00:21:14,376 --> 00:21:16,643
I mean, if we're talking
textbook workaholic

375
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:18,178
with toxic narcissistic
tendencies,

376
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,081
then, yeah, sure, maybe.
But a psychic? No way.

377
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,151
Why would he manifest a vampire
to scare his own daughter?

378
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:27,387
Sasha, tell us exactly
what was going on

379
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:29,089
when you saw
the vampire.

380
00:21:29,091 --> 00:21:31,091
I thought I heard rats

381
00:21:31,093 --> 00:21:32,526
or something
in the attic.

382
00:21:32,528 --> 00:21:34,294
I was going up to see,
but I --

383
00:21:34,296 --> 00:21:35,862
But you got scared.

384
00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:37,864
You got scared,
so you didn't go.

385
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:41,268
- The attic.
- Yeah.

386
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,970
I'll go.
You stay with them.

387
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:55,215
Bobby!

388
00:22:06,262 --> 00:22:08,128
Bobby!

389
00:22:28,784 --> 00:22:30,350
Could you not --

390
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:34,521
Yeah, you know what?
Never mind.

391
00:22:37,826 --> 00:22:40,827
- You okay?
- Well, my father's dying,

392
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:43,263
and there's a strange man
sharpening a...

393
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:47,167
...machete to presumably
kill monsters with

394
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:48,669
in my living room.

395
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:50,337
Thank God
for benzos.

396
00:22:53,108 --> 00:22:55,442
I never should
have come back here.

397
00:22:55,444 --> 00:22:58,078
Thanks, Dad.

398
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,047
No love lost
between you two, huh?

399
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,385
- Look, I get it.
-No offense,

400
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:07,587
but I'm not really up
for a heart-to-heart.

401
00:23:08,957 --> 00:23:10,791
Great. Okay.

402
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,165
My dad wasn't
the best person.

403
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:20,133
He was gone all
the time working.

404
00:23:20,135 --> 00:23:21,835
for us,
he said, but...

405
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:24,604
...my mom...

406
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:29,509
He knew depression
runs in her family.

407
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:32,946
He wasn't there, so I was
the one who found her.

408
00:23:32,948 --> 00:23:34,648
I was 12.

409
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:40,220
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:42,622
Mm.

411
00:23:42,624 --> 00:23:44,324
That's what
everyone says.

412
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:46,360
Except him.

413
00:23:46,362 --> 00:23:48,128
Never said it.

414
00:23:49,932 --> 00:23:53,100
You want to know what
the most ridiculous part is?

415
00:23:53,102 --> 00:23:56,169
I worshipped him
when I was kid.

416
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:58,305
Didn't know any better.

417
00:23:58,307 --> 00:24:00,407
He's the only family
I have left.

418
00:24:06,014 --> 00:24:07,814
Can I give you
a little advice?

419
00:24:12,054 --> 00:24:13,453
Let it go.

420
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,692
The past is...

421
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:22,062
There's nothing
you can do about it now,

422
00:24:22,064 --> 00:24:25,966
so...it's just baggage.

423
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:28,468
Let it go.
You'll feel a lot lighter.

424
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:32,406
Is that
what you do?

425
00:24:33,742 --> 00:24:36,943
I try.

426
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:38,378
Every single day.

427
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:46,446
Maggie.

428
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:50,784
Oh, no.

429
00:25:50,786 --> 00:25:51,852
Okay.

430
00:25:57,493 --> 00:25:59,593
- Sam?
- Hey.

431
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:00,927
- It's here.
- What?

432
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:02,529
It's here.

433
00:26:02,531 --> 00:26:04,331
It's -- It's here.

434
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,980
I-I didn't mean
to get caught. I'm s--

435
00:26:19,982 --> 00:26:21,548
No, no, no. Stop that.

436
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,849
Maggie,

437
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:24,618
you did nothing wrong,
all right?

438
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,819
We're gonna
get you home, okay?

439
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:27,254
We're gonna get you
out of here.

440
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:47,040
Daniel?

441
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:48,675
Hey, Dad.

442
00:26:56,218 --> 00:26:58,251
Daniel...

443
00:26:58,253 --> 00:26:59,619
you can't be --

444
00:26:59,621 --> 00:27:00,987
What?

445
00:27:00,989 --> 00:27:03,023
Here? Real?

446
00:27:03,025 --> 00:27:05,225
But here I am.

447
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:12,032
And, damn,
this feels real good.

448
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:32,218
Aah!

449
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,754
C'mon, Dad.

450
00:27:34,756 --> 00:27:36,790
I know you're curious --

451
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:40,026
what they did,
what <i>you</i> let them do.

452
00:27:40,028 --> 00:27:42,495
It's kind of
a funny story.

453
00:27:42,497 --> 00:27:44,764
They crucified me,

454
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:47,167
piece by piece.

455
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:49,002
Stop!

456
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:50,537
Get away from him.

457
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:52,072
Mary, run!

458
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,213
Aah!

459
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:20,634
No!

460
00:28:20,636 --> 00:28:22,268
Aah!

461
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,454
I'm sorry.

462
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,062
You're giving him
a transfusion?

463
00:29:10,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Oh. Um...

464
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,967
keeps up his iron.
- Ah.

465
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:19,305
Sasha,

466
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:22,108
could you go
make me a sandwich?

467
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:24,810
Seriously?

468
00:29:24,812 --> 00:29:26,779
You want me to make you
a sandwich?

469
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,423
I'll just go
make that sandwich.

470
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:38,624
Great.

471
00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:47,133
Wh-What are you
doing?

472
00:29:47,135 --> 00:29:49,468
It didn't hit me
at first,

473
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,570
but then
I remembered --

474
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:53,906
I've seen
that rig before,

475
00:29:53,908 --> 00:29:55,674
long time ago,

476
00:29:55,676 --> 00:29:57,309
when I was
hooked up to it.

477
00:30:01,215 --> 00:30:03,415
You're not
giving him blood.

478
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:04,850
You're taking it.

479
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:08,954
You're a djinn.

480
00:30:08,956 --> 00:30:11,457
But you knew that
already...

481
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:14,126
didn't you?

482
00:30:14,128 --> 00:30:16,328
Why are you
going after Hunters?

483
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,364
Because
you told me to.

484
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:23,536
Is this still
part of the game?

485
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:25,704
- What game?
- The test.

486
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:30,342
Michael.

487
00:30:30,344 --> 00:30:32,511
You think I'm Michael.

488
00:30:32,513 --> 00:30:34,046
You're not?

489
00:30:34,048 --> 00:30:36,982
No, not anymore.

490
00:30:36,984 --> 00:30:38,350
Hmm...

491
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:40,352
I thought when you showed up
with that ridiculous

492
00:30:40,354 --> 00:30:43,656
"Historic Society" story
that you --

493
00:30:43,658 --> 00:30:46,392
<i>he</i> was testing me,

494
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:48,561
making sure I kept up
my end of the bargain.

495
00:30:48,563 --> 00:30:51,330
- What bargain?
- Stop!

496
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:54,300
Find somewhere quiet,
set up shop,

497
00:30:54,302 --> 00:30:56,101
kill as many Hunters
as I can.

498
00:30:56,103 --> 00:30:58,904
And in return,
he'd give you an upgrade.

499
00:30:58,906 --> 00:31:00,506
It's what he does.

500
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,143
Djinn --

501
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:06,445
What powers
do we really have?

502
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,746
Trapping our little flies,

503
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:10,416
weaving our poisonous webs
inside people's minds.

504
00:31:10,418 --> 00:31:12,685
It's all so...limiting.

505
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:16,055
Now, one touch --

506
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:19,358
I read minds,
see nightmares.

507
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,894
And because of him,

508
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:24,163
because of <i>you,</i>

509
00:31:24,165 --> 00:31:27,366
I can bring those nightmares
into the world --

510
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:30,669
make them do
whatever I want.

511
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:32,404
The old man?

512
00:31:32,406 --> 00:31:34,440
Rawling?

513
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:37,076
His worst nightmare is dying
in this house --

514
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:39,345
unmourned, unloved,

515
00:31:39,347 --> 00:31:41,347
rotting away
in the family crypt,

516
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:43,549
alone with
his own regret.

517
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:46,418
It's a tad macabre,
don't you think?

518
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,054
Now, your little
Hunter girl?

519
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:52,591
Hers were
much more interesting.

520
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:55,628
It's a shame what those vampires
did to her family.

521
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,663
Quite a place
she comes from,

522
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,531
and your friend
Bobby.

523
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:04,470
The things slithering
around in his mind.

524
00:32:04,472 --> 00:32:05,971
Ooh.

525
00:32:05,973 --> 00:32:08,240
I said stop.

526
00:32:08,242 --> 00:32:11,210
We both know that
won't do me any harm.

527
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:15,080
And I highly doubt you have
a knife dipped in lamb's blood.

528
00:32:15,082 --> 00:32:16,949
No, but
it'll slow you down.

529
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:21,820
Ow!

530
00:32:27,361 --> 00:32:28,861
Relax.

531
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,229
I won't let anything happen

532
00:32:30,231 --> 00:32:32,031
to Michael's
favorite monkey suit,

533
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,899
but I am curious...

534
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:36,101
what are your nightmares?

535
00:32:47,014 --> 00:32:49,415
You -- You're --

536
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,520
You know, I don't have a blade
dipped in lamb's blood...

537
00:32:56,424 --> 00:32:58,424
...but I can improvise.

538
00:33:07,835 --> 00:33:10,869
You think
I'm the only one,

539
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:13,072
the only trap?

540
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,374
He made dozens of us,

541
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:18,744
just out there
waiting for you

542
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,647
and your family.

543
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:23,449
You don't know
my family.

544
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,511
So, that's all?

545
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:54,080
Yeah.

546
00:33:54,082 --> 00:33:56,582
The djinn's poison
was keeping him under.

547
00:33:56,584 --> 00:33:58,684
Give him some time.
He'll come back around.

548
00:34:00,054 --> 00:34:01,287
Might even
get that apology.

549
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,256
Yeah, maybe.

550
00:34:04,325 --> 00:34:08,127
Maybe not, but can't change
the past, right?

551
00:34:16,171 --> 00:34:18,504
Oh.
It's okay, Dad.

552
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:21,441
I'm here.

553
00:34:53,942 --> 00:34:55,575
Hey.

554
00:34:55,577 --> 00:34:57,743
- Hey!
- How you doing?

555
00:34:57,745 --> 00:34:59,212
- You all right?
- You're back.

556
00:34:59,214 --> 00:35:02,348
- So great to see you.
- Bring it here.

557
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,250
You did this.

558
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:08,287
You got her home.

559
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,961
So, Bobby,

560
00:35:14,963 --> 00:35:16,662
back there --

561
00:35:16,664 --> 00:35:19,832
You weren't supposed
to see that.

562
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:23,536
Caught sight of him in the woods
when I was with Dean.

563
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,671
I wanted
to handle it myself.

564
00:35:27,275 --> 00:35:29,609
Bobby.

565
00:35:29,611 --> 00:35:31,544
You can talk to me.

566
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,350
Daniel was my son.

567
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,221
My wife,
God rest her...

568
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:46,993
...she didn't
die natural.

569
00:35:46,995 --> 00:35:49,262
Daniel and I
buried her together.

570
00:35:54,002 --> 00:35:56,702
After...

571
00:35:56,704 --> 00:35:58,871
well, Hunting,

572
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:01,307
that -- that's what
got us through.

573
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:06,779
Then the angel war
started.

574
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:09,415
I'd been called up
to serve before,

575
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,351
so they gave me a...

576
00:36:12,353 --> 00:36:14,253
platoon, I guess
you could call it.

577
00:36:15,557 --> 00:36:18,224
Dan was in it.

578
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:21,460
We got separated.

579
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:24,997
I guess you can figure
where this is headed.

580
00:36:32,307 --> 00:36:34,907
It wasn't your fault.

581
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:38,010
I'm the one that
brought him to war.

582
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:41,814
I'm the one
who sent him to die.

583
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:45,718
I don't even know
what they did to him.

584
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,454
The angels
took them.

585
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,157
We never found
the bodies.

586
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,860
I never figured

587
00:36:54,862 --> 00:36:58,164
I'd be any kind
of a father to a child.

588
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:02,368
But Daniel....

589
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:08,341
...was the best thing
in my life.

590
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:20,553
I always assumed
that war'd kill me, too,

591
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:22,221
but it didn't.

592
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:26,792
I guess lately,
I've --

593
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:29,061
I've been looking
for other options.

594
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:33,299
The Hunting.

595
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:37,303
It ends the same.

596
00:37:39,707 --> 00:37:41,007
No.

597
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,877
You are not allowed
to give up on me.

598
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:48,648
I don't...

599
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,885
I don't know
any other way to live.

600
00:37:57,592 --> 00:38:00,026
Then we'll find one.

601
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,666
Well, I talked
to Maggie.

602
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:09,001
Says she can't wait to get
back in the saddle.

603
00:38:10,104 --> 00:38:11,418
Really?

604
00:38:11,419 --> 00:38:13,753
Well, she learned
from the best, huh?

605
00:38:16,591 --> 00:38:18,124
Boys.

606
00:38:18,126 --> 00:38:20,192
Um...

607
00:38:20,194 --> 00:38:22,428
We, uh --
We need to talk.

608
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:27,099
Yeah, thank you
again.

609
00:38:27,101 --> 00:38:28,768
Bye.

610
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,170
Okay, so, uh,

611
00:38:31,172 --> 00:38:33,272
the key is under
the garden gnome.

612
00:38:33,274 --> 00:38:35,074
And you're sure
she doesn't mind?

613
00:38:35,076 --> 00:38:37,310
No. Donna says her cabin
is your cabin.

614
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,245
Take as much time
as you need.

615
00:38:39,247 --> 00:38:41,247
Sam.

616
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:48,888
Yeah?
Listen,

617
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,590
those things
I said before --

618
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:52,058
Bobby,
forget about it.

619
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,794
No, no. I...

620
00:38:54,796 --> 00:38:57,797
This job is no picnic.

621
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:02,435
I don't know that I ever
really had it in me.

622
00:39:02,437 --> 00:39:04,203
But <i>you</i> do.

623
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:09,542
We'll -- We'll just
be a few weeks.

624
00:39:09,544 --> 00:39:11,010
As soon as Bobby's back
on his feet --

625
00:39:11,012 --> 00:39:13,479
Hey, I know.

626
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:15,247
If you need
anything --

627
00:39:15,249 --> 00:39:17,650
<i>anything,</i> I'm just
half a day's drive --

628
00:39:17,652 --> 00:39:20,419
Mom, go.
All right? Be happy.

629
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:47,346
Garth? It's Dean.
Here's the deal --

630
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:49,982
Yeah, that's right --
super-charged monsters.

631
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:52,351
Yeah,
a whole new breed.

632
00:39:52,353 --> 00:39:53,953
So, I know things
are crazy right now,

633
00:39:53,955 --> 00:39:55,221
but you got
to listen to me.

634
00:39:55,223 --> 00:39:58,491
We got to stay safe,
use the buddy system.

635
00:39:58,493 --> 00:40:01,060
All right.
Spread the word.

636
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:06,032
Okay.

637
00:40:06,034 --> 00:40:08,167
That's, uh --
That's everybody.

638
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:09,902
Traps for Hunters.

639
00:40:09,904 --> 00:40:12,772
Friggin' awesome.

640
00:40:15,943 --> 00:40:18,644
Dean --
I know, I know.

641
00:40:18,646 --> 00:40:20,246
Not my fault.

642
00:40:20,248 --> 00:40:23,215
It's Michael.
It's all Michael.

643
00:40:23,217 --> 00:40:25,785
You know,
I've been trying to --

644
00:40:25,787 --> 00:40:28,921
not forget,
but to move on

645
00:40:28,923 --> 00:40:31,991
from what I --
from what we --

646
00:40:31,993 --> 00:40:34,060
from what he did.

647
00:40:34,062 --> 00:40:37,029
And I got to be honest,
I was -- I was...

648
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:39,198
starting to feel
like myself again.

649
00:40:40,702 --> 00:40:42,368
Almost.

650
00:40:43,871 --> 00:40:46,539
- So we'll work harder.
- How, Sam?

651
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:48,641
You get sleep three hours
of sleep a night.

652
00:40:48,643 --> 00:40:50,910
All right, then -- then --
then I'll sleep two.

653
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:55,614
Dean, we're going
to find Michael,

654
00:40:55,616 --> 00:40:57,383
and when we do,

655
00:40:57,385 --> 00:40:59,552
we will kill him.

656
00:40:59,554 --> 00:41:01,087
How?

657
00:41:01,089 --> 00:41:02,488
I don't know.
We'll -- We'll --

658
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,457
We'll track down Dark Kaia
and her spear.

659
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:06,058
We'll --

660
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,993
We'll find something.

661
00:41:11,032 --> 00:41:13,232
I hope you're right.
