1
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:05,888
Michael.
He's dead.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,056
Jack, a-are you, uh...

3
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:08,357
I'm me again.

4
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:09,992
You want to know
how much of my soul

5
00:00:09,994 --> 00:00:11,594
I had to burn off
to kill Michael.

6
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:13,662
Yes.
I don't know.

7
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:19,769
Don't be afraid.

8
00:00:21,072 --> 00:00:22,605
You're an angel.

9
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:25,040
You're special because you
heal people for<i> money.</i>

10
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:27,042
You may have noticed,
around here,

11
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:28,177
good life ain't cheap.

12
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:30,579
I was a so-so angel,
but turns out,

13
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:34,483
I am an excellent businesswoman.

14
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:39,688
Why? Nick: I needed the truth.

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,190
I needed revenge for my family.

16
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:42,758
You would've done
the same thing.

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,560
I don't feel sorry
for<i> you,</i> Nick.

18
00:00:44,562 --> 00:00:46,428
I feel sorry for
the people you hurt

19
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,963
and the people you murdered.

20
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,031
You can burn.

21
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:50,232
When am I getting out of here?

22
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:51,667
Listen, you piece of crap.

23
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:54,003
You're gonna be locked up
for the rest of your life.

24
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:00,142
You chose Lucifer.

25
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,243
He chose me.

26
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:02,411
Reject him, Nick.

27
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:03,646
I can't.

28
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:05,381
Where are you going?

29
00:01:05,383 --> 00:01:07,983
Wherever it's darkest,
wherever he is.

30
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,152
Our field trip
is to see Donatello?

31
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:11,187
We're worried about you.

32
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:12,488
How do you feel, Jack?

33
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,589
I don't know.

34
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:15,691
I know I don't
feel... nothing,

35
00:01:15,693 --> 00:01:19,728
but I don't feel
the same, either.

36
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,497
Dean and I, we...
We want to talk to you

37
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:23,899
about your powers.
W-What about them?

38
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:25,601
You know, you just
got 'em back, Jack.

39
00:01:25,603 --> 00:01:27,636
We want to make sure you're
comfortable with them again

40
00:01:27,638 --> 00:01:29,038
before you...

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,272
Before you go all X-Men.

42
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:31,307
You understand that?

43
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:32,575
I understand.

44
00:01:32,577 --> 00:01:35,845
I won't use my powers
without permission.

45
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:37,913
Promise.

46
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:55,030
? Raindrops keep fallin'
on my head ?

47
00:01:57,802 --> 00:02:02,304
? Because I'm free ?

48
00:02:02,306 --> 00:02:04,273
? Nothing's worryin' ?

49
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:15,684
Hold your haystacks!
I'm coming!

50
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:21,924
Geez! I'm coming!

51
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:24,727
Holy Christmas.

52
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,795
Hello.

53
00:02:26,797 --> 00:02:29,231
Can I help you?

54
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:33,702
? Raindrops keep
fallin' on my head ?

55
00:02:33,704 --> 00:02:35,437
? But that doesn't mean ?

56
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,174
? My eyes will soon be
turnin' red ?

57
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:40,442
Please.

58
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:42,878
Shh.
No. Oh, no.

59
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,247
? I'm never gonna
stop the rain ?

60
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:48,984
No, no, no, no, no.
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah!

61
00:02:51,322 --> 00:02:53,956
? Nothing's worryin' me ?

Warner Bros. Television

64
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,337
Come on.

65
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,958
Do you think we have enough?

66
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,060
Son of a bitch!
What...

67
00:03:31,062 --> 00:03:33,228
I thought this was
supposed to relax him.

68
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,731
Um, it will...

69
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:37,499
I hope.

70
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:41,036
I just thought it would be nice
to stay in for a change.

71
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:43,405
You know, this was his favorite
game when he was little.

72
00:03:44,742 --> 00:03:47,576
How about you?
Feeling better?

73
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:49,578
Everybody keeps asking me that.

74
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,681
We're family.
It's our job.

75
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:55,384
Well, it's annoying.

76
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:00,255
Jack...

77
00:04:00,257 --> 00:04:04,093
if you ever want
to talk or... vent...

78
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:10,165
You're here. I know.

79
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,977
All right.
Winchester game night is a go...

80
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:23,379
Soon as Sammy gets back here

81
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:26,749
with the two double-pepperoni
meat blasters

82
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,484
and a pineapple.

83
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:29,718
I like it.

84
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,520
Yeah, it's like
a crime against humanity.

85
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,488
You missed a call.

86
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,324
Oh.

87
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:36,692
<i>Dean.</i>

88
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:42,498
What's wrong?

89
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,966
<i>Help me, please!</i>

90
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:50,806
<i>- Dean.
- It's me.</i>

91
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:52,941
<i>It's Donatello.</i>
Donatello?

92
00:04:52,943 --> 00:04:54,543
<i>I need help.</i>

93
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:58,213
<i>You and Sam.
Help me, please!</i>

94
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,416
<i>Hith-'o-rehr, shqodh...</i>

95
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:02,584
<i>ki'o-yivkha has-sa-tan,</i>

96
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:04,620
<i>k'ar-yeh sho-'ehgh,</i>

97
00:05:04,622 --> 00:05:05,888
<i>mith-hal-lehkh,</i>

98
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,426
<i>u-mvaq-qehsh 'eth asher
yval-leha'.</i>

99
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:16,665
<i>You've reached Sam Winchester.</i>

100
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,801
<i>If this is an emergency,
call my brother.</i>

101
00:05:18,803 --> 00:05:20,803
Sam's not answering his phone.

102
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:22,271
This whole damn town's
a dead zone.

103
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:23,839
All right.
We got to go.

104
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:25,240
What do I do?
Stay here.

105
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,109
When Sam gets back,
play him that voicemail

106
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:28,644
and have him call me
on my spare.

107
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:31,213
- Got it?
- Got it.

108
00:05:31,215 --> 00:05:33,048
So much for game night.

109
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:48,397
? We had a quarrel ?

110
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,867
Wow. This place is so...

111
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:53,335
Ugh.

112
00:05:55,806 --> 00:05:57,539
I appreciate you coming.

113
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,008
Well, you said
you had something for me.

114
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,044
Hi. Can I get you
some coffee?

115
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:04,046
No. Thank you.

116
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:07,182
Yes.

117
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:10,486
? For I still love you ?

118
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:14,556
16th-century
Burmese blood rubies.

119
00:06:14,558 --> 00:06:17,893
Five carats.
Excellent clarity.

120
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:19,761
Castiel,
where did you get these?

121
00:06:19,763 --> 00:06:20,829
On a case.

122
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:22,197
They are lightly cursed,

123
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,366
but it's nothing
that would affect an angel.

124
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:25,968
Uh-huh.

125
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,503
And you're giving these to me?

126
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:31,406
No. No.
I-I need something.

127
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:33,375
I need your help.

128
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:37,513
To contact God.

129
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:42,251
Yeah.
Good luck with that.

130
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:44,153
You forget, Anael, I know you.

131
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:47,456
I know what you did
before your demotion.

132
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,659
When you were Joshua's
right hand.

133
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,929
And I know that God spoke
to Joshua.

134
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:56,665
And only to Joshua.

135
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,967
Now, he's dead, but...

136
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:01,136
But you understand
how they communicated.

137
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:02,804
Why do you want to know?

138
00:07:02,806 --> 00:07:05,374
There's a nephilim... Jack.

139
00:07:05,376 --> 00:07:06,642
Lucifer's son?

140
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:09,044
Yes.

141
00:07:09,046 --> 00:07:10,445
Jack killed Michael.

142
00:07:10,447 --> 00:07:12,114
Good night, sweet prince.

143
00:07:12,116 --> 00:07:15,918
But to do so, he... he used
magic that consumed his soul.

144
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,619
Not all of it, I hope,

145
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:20,556
but we just don't know
how much Jack has left.

146
00:07:20,558 --> 00:07:22,858
And I've been looking
through all the lore,

147
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,294
and it all says the same thing.

148
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:26,929
Only God can restore a soul.

149
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:28,664
And that's why you need him.

150
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:29,798
Right.

151
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:35,971
The Winchesters... they don't
know you're here, do they?

152
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:38,574
Why do you say that?

153
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:41,677
Oh, I don't know,
just a general reek

154
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:45,113
of ill-conceived
lone-wolf desperation.

155
00:07:46,684 --> 00:07:48,417
Will you help me or not?

156
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:52,521
Not. Sorry.

157
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:56,091
You see,
Joshua never spoke to God.

158
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:58,026
God spoke to<i> him.</i>

159
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,928
There's a big difference.

160
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,599
I see.

161
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:07,703
But...

162
00:08:07,705 --> 00:08:09,805
there was a rumor.

163
00:08:09,807 --> 00:08:12,241
A whisper, after the Fall.

164
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:16,845
Joshua placed a long-distance
call, and God picked up.

165
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:18,914
Okay. How?

166
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,817
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

167
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,752
But I know someone who was,

168
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,520
and I can take you to them.

169
00:08:27,558 --> 00:08:28,890
I should be there with you.

170
00:08:28,892 --> 00:08:30,626
<i>It's fine.</i>
No, it's not.

171
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:32,127
You heard Donny's
message, right?

172
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:33,929
Yeah, I did.
<i>He sounds like he's</i>

173
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,098
<i>speaking in tongues...
Like he's possessed again.</i>

174
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,699
No, that's not...

175
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:41,136
It's not Enochian. I-I-I think
it's Ancient Hebrew.

176
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:42,771
- What's he saying?
<i>- We don't know yet.</i>

177
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:44,106
I'm still working on it.

178
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:46,508
- All right, well, work fast.
- Watch your back.

179
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,843
That's the plan.

180
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:53,682
Ancient Hebrew.
What the hell?

181
00:08:53,684 --> 00:08:55,817
Sammy sounds stressed.

182
00:08:57,554 --> 00:09:00,255
It's not just Sam.

183
00:09:00,257 --> 00:09:02,591
It's Jack...

184
00:09:02,593 --> 00:09:05,294
it's you.

185
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:07,629
I just wish there
was something that I c...

186
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:11,066
Hey. You're here, okay?
You're here.

187
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,072
But I should've been here more.

188
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:23,045
But I know how I am.

189
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:26,782
I can be closed off...

190
00:09:26,784 --> 00:09:29,351
and hard.

191
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:32,421
Yeah, well, that's where
I get it from.

192
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:41,763
Listen.

193
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:44,766
I just need you to know...

194
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:47,602
I'm grateful.

195
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:50,639
For every day I get to
spend with you and Sam.

196
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,613
<i>Hith-'o-rehr, shqodh...</i>

197
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:01,249
<i>ki 'o-yivkha has-sa-tan,</i>

198
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:02,984
<i>k'ar-yeh sho-'ehgh...</i>

199
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:04,319
Wait a second.
Wait, wait, wait.

200
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:05,587
<i>...mith-hal-lehkh...</i>
This...

201
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:07,489
<i>...u-mvaq-qehsh...</i>
I know this.

202
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:08,824
<i>...'eth asher yval-leha'.</i>
What?

203
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:10,826
Donatello's message... i-it's...

204
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:13,428
It's from the Bible.

205
00:10:15,632 --> 00:10:18,867
It's... it's Peter.

206
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,536
Peter 5:8.

207
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,305
Here.

208
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:25,407
"Be sober, be vigilant,

209
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:27,476
because your adversary
the Devil,

210
00:10:27,478 --> 00:10:30,045
as a roaring lion,
walketh about,

211
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:33,315
seeking whom
he may devour."

212
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,299
Donatello?!

213
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:54,302
<i>Oh, please!
Dean! Please!</i>

214
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:55,470
Donatello?!

215
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:56,738
<i>Help me, Dean! Help!</i>

216
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,575
<i>Ohh! Oh! Sam! Dean!</i>

217
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,511
<i>Help! Help me!</i>

218
00:11:02,513 --> 00:11:05,614
Good. You made it.

219
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:12,087
Where's Donatello?

220
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:16,191
What, no "hey"?
"How ya been"?

221
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:23,766
So it's just you, huh?

222
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:26,268
Sammy's home sick?

223
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,604
How are you even... Here?

224
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:31,240
Instead of rotting away in
a jail cell where you left me?

225
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:33,776
Sort of a funny story...

226
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:37,012
and by "funny,"
I mean a lot of people died.

227
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:40,516
No one's here, but...

228
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:42,584
I saw this in the trash.

229
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:44,453
Dumpster diving.

230
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:46,688
Classy, Mamabear.

231
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,224
What did you do?
Nothing.

232
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:53,896
I mean, I sort of injected
your friend with poison...

233
00:11:53,898 --> 00:11:55,731
Thallium, to be exact.

234
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:57,065
So he's got about a day

235
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:58,867
before his internal organs
start shutting down.

236
00:11:58,869 --> 00:12:00,836
But that's just sort of
a "guesstimate."

237
00:12:00,838 --> 00:12:03,372
Why?

238
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:05,140
To get your attention.

239
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,877
I mean, he was...
Is, sorry<i> is...</i>

240
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,380
One of your friends, right, and
you don't have a lot of those.

241
00:12:11,382 --> 00:12:13,115
I'm not buying a word of this.

242
00:12:13,117 --> 00:12:15,083
No?

243
00:12:20,457 --> 00:12:22,357
Hit the live-stream button.

244
00:12:33,704 --> 00:12:36,271
You can save him
if you can find him.

245
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,410
Where is he?!

246
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:43,612
Ooh, the angry voice.

247
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:45,447
Hey, if you kill me,
you kill him.

248
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:47,549
Do it.
What do I got to live for?

249
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:48,917
Go.

250
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:53,488
What do you want?

251
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,191
I want to talk.

252
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:25,387
We're closed.

253
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,089
Even for us, Methuselah?

254
00:13:27,091 --> 00:13:28,490
Yeah.

255
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:31,026
We're friends of Joshua.

256
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:33,228
Joshua didn't have any friends.

257
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,396
Except you.

258
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:35,931
You sheltered him
after the Fall.

259
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:39,902
I didn't "shelter"...
We were roommates.

260
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:42,004
Okay?
He made a mean lasagna.

261
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:44,439
You saw him try to contact God.
How did he do it?

262
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:46,541
Yeah.
Maybe try asking<i> him.</i>

263
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:48,977
Can't. Dead.

264
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:50,779
Well, guess you're outta luck.

265
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:55,083
No. You'll tell me, or I'll
burn this place to the ground

266
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,085
and you with it.

267
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,254
Kiddo, how old am I?

268
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,757
Go for it.
Put me out of my misery.

269
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,693
Is that really what you want?

270
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:10,365
The, um, thingamajig he used,

271
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:12,467
it's around here somewhere.

272
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:14,002
Where?

273
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:16,271
I don't know.
Somewhere.

274
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,706
You're angels, right?

275
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,875
I'm sure you'll know it
when you see it.

276
00:14:21,478 --> 00:14:22,811
Or not.

277
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:42,297
Whoa! Hey. Hey!
Not now. Okay?

278
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,132
Not yet.

279
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,908
But he was... He was just
sitting there waiting for you?

280
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,043
That doesn't make any sense.
What kind of game is he playing here?

281
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:56,511
I don't know. If you ask me,
that psycho's seen

282
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:58,347
way too many
'90s serial-killer movies.

283
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:00,382
Nick doesn't even know
Donatello.

284
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:02,050
Lucifer did.

285
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:04,920
It doesn't make any sense to me,
either, but Donatello...

286
00:15:04,922 --> 00:15:06,488
We're... we're running
out of time.

287
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,056
The poison we can handle...
Thallium.

288
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:10,258
The antidote is Prussian Blue.
We have some of that here.

289
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,427
A-And the live feed
Nick showed you,

290
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:15,364
um, maybe I can hack that?

291
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:16,732
Good. Great.

292
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:18,834
But it's gonna take time.
Maybe more than we have.

293
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,703
All right, well, Nick said
he wanted to talk.

294
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:24,473
So let's talk.
Yeah, let's talk.

295
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:26,675
Hey, hey.
No, no, no.

296
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,844
What?
I need you to stay here.

297
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,747
Why?
The way you are right now...

298
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:34,483
If Nick looks at you wrong,
you're gonna waste him.

299
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:37,185
That can't happen!

300
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:40,555
All right. Yeah. Sure.

301
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,591
Not yet.

302
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:44,693
Right.

303
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:53,835
Sam...

304
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:57,205
Donatello's in this
because of me.

305
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,574
A police officer is dead
because of me.

306
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:03,478
I'm the one who let Nick go,
I'm the one who...

307
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,282
What was I thinking?

308
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:09,317
You thought
he deserved a chance.

309
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:11,386
Yeah, well, he didn't.

310
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,755
Sam, look at me.

311
00:16:13,757 --> 00:16:16,158
Nick's choices are his.

312
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,560
Just his.

313
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,562
You didn't know th...

314
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:21,997
That's not an excuse.

315
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:24,099
No one's making excuses, but...

316
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:27,169
You gave him a chance
because you felt for him...

317
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:30,272
...because
you're a good man.

318
00:16:33,777 --> 00:16:36,778
You are.

319
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,948
It's one of the reasons
I'm so proud of you.

320
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:50,492
Are you insane?

321
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:52,394
This is Mulberry silk.

322
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:53,962
Sorry.

323
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,599
So, Methuselah said...

324
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:00,902
We'd know it when
we'd see it. Right.

325
00:17:00,904 --> 00:17:02,771
No.

326
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,373
Well,<i> you</i> might.

327
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,342
When you were working
for Joshua, did you ever...

328
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:10,378
Even if we found
Joshua's batphone,

329
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,414
God's not gonna care.

330
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,249
- You wanna know how I know?
- How?

331
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:16,651
You ever wonder
why a vaunted apprentice

332
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:18,386
became a lowly button pusher?

333
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:22,591
Well, I heard that Joshua
offered you more responsibility,

334
00:17:22,593 --> 00:17:24,025
and you just walked away.

335
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:27,696
I believed in Heaven.

336
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:29,331
You know, our mission.

337
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,299
I believed, Castiel.

338
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:34,469
But then I got to Earth, and I saw that
it wasn't the paradise God promised.

339
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,571
I mean, there was
so much hate...

340
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:38,840
so much suffering.

341
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:41,409
So I asked Joshua...

342
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:44,212
I mean, these were
God's creations...

343
00:17:44,214 --> 00:17:47,415
His perfect people.

344
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:49,918
Why wasn't he helping them?

345
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,920
And do you know what he said?

346
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:53,555
No.

347
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:54,723
"God doesn't meddle."

348
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:57,592
He doesn't meddle?

349
00:17:57,594 --> 00:18:00,795
Well, I do.
So I do.

350
00:18:00,797 --> 00:18:04,032
And here I thought you just
performed miracles for the money.

351
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:08,403
Well, you haven't been
paying attention, then.

352
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:10,672
I do them for me.

353
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,407
I don't need Heaven.

354
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:14,342
And I don't need God.

355
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,312
And...

356
00:18:17,314 --> 00:18:19,714
I'm happy, Castiel.

357
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:22,384
Really?

358
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:24,719
Because that sounds lonely.

359
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:27,889
We're all lonely,

360
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:29,691
because we're all alone.

361
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:33,795
From ant to lion
to human to angel.

362
00:18:33,797 --> 00:18:36,464
Every last one of us.

363
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:39,134
You know, he<i> does</i> meddle.

364
00:18:39,136 --> 00:18:42,637
God reached down,
and he brought me back to life.

365
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:45,040
So he saves one angel...

366
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:49,544
and watches millions of people
die screaming, every day.

367
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,915
What does that say about him?

368
00:18:59,823 --> 00:19:03,024
Where's Donatello?

369
00:19:03,026 --> 00:19:05,360
You having fun?

370
00:19:05,362 --> 00:19:08,630
Oh, yeah.
Having a riot.

371
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:11,199
I get you, Dean.

372
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:13,001
You and me,

373
00:19:13,003 --> 00:19:15,036
we're almost like brothers,
you know.

374
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,107
Michael, you, Lucifer, me...

375
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:20,442
We both know what it's like

376
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:24,045
to be hog-tied
to a nuclear warhead, man.

377
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:26,314
Mm.

378
00:19:28,885 --> 00:19:30,885
Cut the crap.

379
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:31,953
Where is he?

380
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:38,927
You're never the same after
something like that, are ya?

381
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,596
Being one with one of them.

382
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,999
It changes you.

383
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:47,002
Makes you more than human.

384
00:19:47,004 --> 00:19:49,004
Come on, Dean, admit it.

385
00:19:49,006 --> 00:19:51,673
With Michael, you were a prince.

386
00:19:51,675 --> 00:19:54,409
Now you're just a broken Hunter.

387
00:19:54,411 --> 00:19:56,845
You're too stupid
to know you've been beat.

388
00:19:58,515 --> 00:20:01,549
Beat? What are you
beating me at?

389
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:02,884
Hmm?

390
00:20:02,886 --> 00:20:06,521
Come on, Nick.

391
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:08,556
What's this all about?

392
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,594
I want to see my son.

393
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:17,365
<i>His</i> son?
He said that?

394
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:20,302
He says he wants to
talk to Jack... alone.

395
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:22,871
No.

396
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:24,706
Absolutely not.

397
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,141
I'm not afraid of him.

398
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:30,679
Nick's cracked. He's friggin'
Cocoa Puffs, okay?

399
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:35,483
Sam?

400
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:39,921
I mean... "I mean"?
What do you mean, you mean?

401
00:20:39,923 --> 00:20:41,956
I-I mean...

402
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,726
Look, finding Donatello
is going slowly, Dean,

403
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:48,063
and Nick is locked
down in our bunker.

404
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:49,664
How's he even a threat?

405
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,466
He's<i> always</i> a threat.

406
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:57,505
Donatello helped me,
and now he needs my help.

407
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,543
He's my friend.

408
00:21:04,548 --> 00:21:07,782
And I don't think
we have another choice.

409
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,435
Hey, sonny boy.

410
00:21:27,437 --> 00:21:28,536
Where's Donatello?

411
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:31,773
Wow.
You're so tough.

412
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:33,575
That's your pop, you realize.

413
00:21:33,577 --> 00:21:35,210
My father was a monster.

414
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,145
Everybody's a monster.

415
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:38,513
Even your three dads...

416
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:40,081
How many innocent people
you think they've killed?

417
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,550
Answer the question!

418
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,186
He loved you.

419
00:21:45,188 --> 00:21:48,089
You know that?

420
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:49,624
He did.

421
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:52,093
I felt it.

422
00:21:52,095 --> 00:21:54,129
He loved you so much...

423
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:57,065
and you broke his heart.

424
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:04,305
Of course, I'm talking
about the<i> old</i> you.

425
00:22:04,307 --> 00:22:05,940
You with the soul.

426
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:11,646
Yeah. Kermit the Prophet
told me all about your sitch.

427
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:15,517
What's that like, not having
a soul? Must be relaxing.

428
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:18,420
I have a soul. I don't know.
I don't... I don't see it.

429
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:21,222
I'm looking right at you,
and I see nothing.

430
00:22:21,224 --> 00:22:22,357
I have a soul!

431
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:38,973
Y-You good?

432
00:22:43,213 --> 00:22:46,314
Sorry. I'm sorry.

433
00:22:46,316 --> 00:22:48,883
I'm s... sorry.

434
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:50,552
I'm serious.

435
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,194
How'd it go?

436
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:02,363
Did he...?

437
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:08,903
Nick. He'll show us
where to find Donatello.

438
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:14,074
<i>Mama!</i>

439
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:15,976
<i>Mama!</i>

440
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,379
<i>Mama.</i>

441
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,682
Ugh!

442
00:23:21,684 --> 00:23:24,518
Yeah. I'm done.

443
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,488
Look, I just stepped
on a rat, so...

444
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,156
Anael... Skip it.

445
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,825
Skip the whole judgmental crap

446
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,793
designed to play
at my insecurities,

447
00:23:32,795 --> 00:23:35,095
and I will skip
my inevitable witty reply

448
00:23:35,097 --> 00:23:37,031
about the real reason
you're doing all this.

449
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:39,099
What do you mean
the real reason?

450
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:41,435
I'm doing this for Jack.

451
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:43,604
No, you're not.

452
00:23:43,606 --> 00:23:45,506
You're doing this
because you're afraid.

453
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:48,008
Because in your mind,
it'd be easier to call God

454
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,377
than to tell Sam and Dean
Winchester the truth.

455
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:52,913
The truth?

456
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:56,150
Jack's soul is gone, Castiel.

457
00:23:56,152 --> 00:23:58,819
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

458
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:02,289
Look. I don't want to say all
that and hurt your feelings,

459
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:06,227
so... what do you say
we call it a night?

460
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,940
Boy, that Jack has...

461
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:22,543
got issues, right?

462
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,990
You throwin' in the towel?

463
00:24:37,627 --> 00:24:39,426
Hey.

464
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,062
Our deal?

465
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,343
I've seen that before.

466
00:24:56,345 --> 00:24:58,045
Where?

467
00:24:58,047 --> 00:25:00,814
Crystal shop? A dollar store?
Ren fair?

468
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:03,050
No.

469
00:25:04,854 --> 00:25:08,389
The one I know, it... it glows
in the presence of... of God.

470
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:10,624
- This is what we're looking for.
- Good eye.

471
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:13,627
Joshua forged it after he Fell.

472
00:25:13,629 --> 00:25:15,429
That thing talks to God?

473
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,264
Only one way to find out.

474
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,113
God...

475
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,849
I don't know where you are.
I don't know if you can hear me.

476
00:25:35,851 --> 00:25:37,751
But please.

477
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:41,722
Sam, Dean... we need you.

478
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:43,490
Please.

479
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:52,566
Yeah, it never worked
for Joshua, either.

480
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:10,384
So, the warehouse
is just down there.

481
00:26:10,386 --> 00:26:11,585
Want me to show you?

482
00:26:11,587 --> 00:26:13,454
No.
You're gonna stay here.

483
00:26:13,456 --> 00:26:15,022
All by my lonesome?

484
00:26:15,024 --> 00:26:18,025
Look, you try anything funny,
Sammy's gonna shoot you.

485
00:26:18,027 --> 00:26:19,360
Anything happens to me...

486
00:26:19,362 --> 00:26:21,695
Wait. Let me guess.
Sammy's gonna shoot me.

487
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:23,297
Yeah, to start.

488
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:25,499
Here. Antidote.
Donatello.

489
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,176
It's too bad.

490
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,746
I would have really enjoyed
giving God a piece of my mind.

491
00:26:38,748 --> 00:26:42,216
But what can I say.
I'm always right.

492
00:26:43,552 --> 00:26:45,519
So, what are you gonna do now?

493
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,321
Go home.

494
00:26:47,323 --> 00:26:49,890
Go home and tell Sam and Dean
the truth.

495
00:26:49,892 --> 00:26:52,593
And then?

496
00:26:52,595 --> 00:26:55,162
I don't know.

497
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,299
Oh.

498
00:27:01,437 --> 00:27:03,470
Thank you.

499
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:05,439
It's been swell.

500
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:08,008
Do you need a ride?

501
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,843
I'll call a cab.

502
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,014
Anael.

503
00:27:14,016 --> 00:27:16,450
You know,
you're not<i> always</i> right.

504
00:27:16,452 --> 00:27:19,920
Just because God's not with us
doesn't mean we're alone.

505
00:27:19,922 --> 00:27:23,524
Why? Because we all
have each other?

506
00:27:23,526 --> 00:27:25,659
Yes.

507
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:33,233
You hear from Sam and Dean?

508
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,435
No, not yet.

509
00:27:34,437 --> 00:27:35,903
What's all this?

510
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:38,839
Some stuff we found
at Donatello's.

511
00:27:38,841 --> 00:27:41,075
It's not helping.

512
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:42,943
This...

513
00:27:42,945 --> 00:27:44,545
this was grace.

514
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,481
Can't you feel it?

515
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:03,764
This was filled
with angelic grace.

516
00:28:22,485 --> 00:28:25,219
It's nice that
we're finally alone.

517
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:28,455
I feel like I never get a chance
to talk to you anymore.

518
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:36,196
? Oh, Sammy boy, Sammy boy ?

519
00:28:36,198 --> 00:28:39,366
? Your phone,
your phone is calling ?

520
00:28:39,368 --> 00:28:42,569
Mom?

521
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,071
Mom? Hey.

522
00:28:44,073 --> 00:28:46,773
? Sammy boy,
oh, Sammy boy ?

523
00:28:46,775 --> 00:28:48,375
? The phone is calling ?

524
00:28:48,377 --> 00:28:52,479
No. He's not back yet.
Yeah.

525
00:29:04,293 --> 00:29:05,659
Hey.

526
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:11,532
All right.

527
00:29:16,572 --> 00:29:18,005
He's sure?

528
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:21,208
Damn it.

529
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:30,817
Out of the car!
Get out of the car!

530
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:32,186
All right, all right, all right.

531
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,021
Whoa. Whoa!

532
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,455
Oh, whoa, whoa.

533
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:37,224
Was that Mamabear?

534
00:29:37,226 --> 00:29:38,859
There was never any poison.

535
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:40,961
You injected Donatello
with angel grace.

536
00:29:40,963 --> 00:29:42,262
Why?!

537
00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:44,631
Wow.
She figured it out.

538
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:46,500
That's good.
Talk!

539
00:29:46,502 --> 00:29:50,204
Prophets are sort of
like old CB radios.

540
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:53,674
You boost their power or you
mess with their frequency...

541
00:29:53,676 --> 00:29:54,908
CB radio?

542
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:58,111
Y-You trying to communicate
with someone?

543
00:29:58,113 --> 00:30:00,247
Who?

544
00:30:00,249 --> 00:30:02,382
Search your feelings, Sam.

545
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:07,054
No. No.
Lucifer's dead.

546
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:09,489
He's in the Empty.
Yeah, and he's awake...

547
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:13,594
...and with the help of
your little prophet friend,

548
00:30:13,596 --> 00:30:15,362
I was able to have a convo
with him,

549
00:30:15,364 --> 00:30:19,299
and he told me
how to bring him back.

550
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:20,968
It won't be easy.

551
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,502
You'll have to prove yourself.

552
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:24,171
The Winchesters
will be a problem.

553
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:26,573
But you can use that,
twist it...

554
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,308
find a way to get to my son.

555
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:31,511
His blood.
You need his blood.

556
00:30:31,513 --> 00:30:33,914
Come on, Sam.
Nobody stays dead anymore.

557
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,916
You know that.

558
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:41,221
All you need is a little
elbow grease, some new friends.

559
00:30:41,223 --> 00:30:43,590
Where you think
I got that angel grace?

560
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:48,028
Who do you think hid me
after I carved up that cop?

561
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:50,731
Demons. Yeah.

562
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:53,166
They want Lucifer back
almost as much as me.

563
00:30:53,168 --> 00:30:54,701
So, thanks.

564
00:30:57,006 --> 00:30:59,706
Dean!

565
00:31:59,935 --> 00:32:02,169
Lucifer's perfect vessel.

566
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,805
Not so perfect now, are ya?

567
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,653
Come on, Sam.

568
00:32:19,655 --> 00:32:21,455
Hit play, baby.

569
00:32:21,457 --> 00:32:24,057
Come on, Sam!

570
00:32:48,684 --> 00:32:50,650
Come on!

571
00:32:58,694 --> 00:33:00,627
Dean!

572
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:09,136
Dean.

573
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:10,437
Sam?

574
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:13,240
Hey, hey, hey.
Sammy. Yo...

575
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,392
Hey!

576
00:33:24,394 --> 00:33:26,628
Nick... he's trying
to resurrect Lucifer.

577
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,563
How?
<i>I don't know!</i>

578
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:29,965
I don't know.
He played us.

579
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:33,034
- Oh, God. Help me.
- Hey! Hey!

580
00:33:34,238 --> 00:33:35,504
We have to stop him.

581
00:33:35,506 --> 00:33:37,105
Thanks.

582
00:33:39,176 --> 00:33:41,343
Yeah, well, we don't
even where he is, okay?

583
00:33:41,345 --> 00:33:43,211
And he hurt Sam.
He got him in the head.

584
00:33:43,213 --> 00:33:44,746
I don't even want to move him.

585
00:33:44,748 --> 00:33:46,882
<i>We called an ambulance,
but they said 20 minutes.</i>

586
00:33:46,884 --> 00:33:48,783
It's not good, Mom.
It's really bad.

587
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,653
We're on our way.

588
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,869
What is it?

589
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:44,506
I feel... It feels
like my blood's burning.

590
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,143
He has it.

591
00:34:48,145 --> 00:34:50,712
I have a soul!

592
00:34:54,017 --> 00:34:56,918
This was about you, Jack.

593
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,687
All of it.

594
00:35:00,157 --> 00:35:01,356
He needed your blood.

595
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:04,226
I feel it.
I can feel him.

596
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:08,129
<i>...qui dormiunt,
ad dominum formosum.</i>

597
00:35:08,131 --> 00:35:12,968
<i>Nexus noster, restitutus est.</i>

598
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,970
Where? Where is he?

599
00:35:14,972 --> 00:35:19,975
I think I know... I think
I-I can get us to him.

600
00:35:19,977 --> 00:35:23,712
But I need to use my powers.

601
00:35:23,714 --> 00:35:26,481
Do it.

602
00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:32,320
<i>Surgas ex abysso,
in lumine exsistas!</i>

603
00:35:48,038 --> 00:35:49,571
Lucifer.

604
00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:54,643
I'm here.

605
00:35:54,645 --> 00:35:57,212
I'm ready.

606
00:35:57,214 --> 00:35:59,447
Your vessel.

607
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,483
Your perfect vessel.

608
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:03,385
Make me strong again.

609
00:36:03,387 --> 00:36:04,953
Make me you.

610
00:36:22,105 --> 00:36:23,638
No!

611
00:36:28,045 --> 00:36:30,378
No, wait! Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

612
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,847
What did you do?!

613
00:36:36,086 --> 00:36:37,819
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

614
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:40,488
Jack!

615
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,625
Aah!
Jack!

616
00:36:43,627 --> 00:36:47,062
What are you doing?!

617
00:36:47,064 --> 00:36:48,296
Stop it!

618
00:36:52,703 --> 00:36:54,502
Stop it!

619
00:36:57,341 --> 00:37:00,275
Stop! Stop!

620
00:37:00,277 --> 00:37:01,943
Jack, stop it!

621
00:37:16,126 --> 00:37:17,625
Hey. Hey. Come on.
Stay with me now.

622
00:37:17,627 --> 00:37:19,127
We're just gonna play
a little game.

623
00:37:19,129 --> 00:37:20,929
We're gonna count, okay?
We're gonna count.

624
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:23,031
Count with me. One...

625
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:24,199
two...

626
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:25,800
Two.
Yeah, there you go.

627
00:37:25,802 --> 00:37:27,469
...three.

628
00:37:27,471 --> 00:37:29,003
Come on. Come on.

629
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:31,272
You... You always put...
You always put me first.

630
00:37:31,274 --> 00:37:33,742
No, no. Shh, shh.
Come on. Come on, man.

631
00:37:33,744 --> 00:37:37,545
Your whole life...

632
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:38,980
Okay. All right.

633
00:37:38,982 --> 00:37:41,983
All right. Come on. Come on.
Just count with me.

634
00:37:41,985 --> 00:37:45,019
Sammy. Hey! Sam!

635
00:37:54,264 --> 00:37:56,264
Mary?

636
00:37:59,836 --> 00:38:02,203
I had to.

637
00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:07,208
Uh...

638
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:10,512
Sam... Uh, he's hurt.

639
00:38:10,514 --> 00:38:12,180
Help him.

640
00:38:20,357 --> 00:38:22,357
Dean?

641
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:23,391
Sam.

642
00:38:36,306 --> 00:38:39,007
Nick. Where's Nick?

643
00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:42,143
I stopped him.
It's over.

644
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:45,013
What about Mom?

645
00:38:45,015 --> 00:38:47,348
She's fine.

646
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:54,088
Everything's gonna be fine.

647
00:39:10,207 --> 00:39:12,407
I healed Sam.

648
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:15,109
Everything's gonna be okay.

649
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,380
Good.

650
00:39:19,382 --> 00:39:21,616
That's good.

651
00:39:21,618 --> 00:39:24,452
Mary.

652
00:39:24,454 --> 00:39:26,120
Nick...

653
00:39:26,122 --> 00:39:29,557
he was a bad person, a killer.

654
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:31,226
I had to stop him.

655
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,297
Not like that.

656
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,634
He deserved it.

657
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:45,440
Take me home, Jack.

658
00:39:45,442 --> 00:39:47,208
I-I will.

659
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:51,246
I will. I-I just...

660
00:39:51,248 --> 00:39:54,315
Tell me it's okay.

661
00:39:58,388 --> 00:40:00,154
It's not.

662
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:03,324
<i>You're</i> not.

663
00:40:03,326 --> 00:40:05,193
You...

664
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:08,563
It's not your fault,

665
00:40:08,565 --> 00:40:11,466
but the Jack I know

666
00:40:11,468 --> 00:40:13,868
would never have done that.

667
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,238
You... You're...

668
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,806
Something's wrong.

669
00:40:18,808 --> 00:40:21,476
No, I'm not.
<i>You're</i> wrong.

670
00:40:21,478 --> 00:40:24,245
Sweetheart.

671
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:25,713
You know I'm not.

672
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,683
You know, Sam and Dean,
they were grateful.

673
00:40:31,321 --> 00:40:33,788
If Sam and Dean
saw what you did,

674
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,424
they would be
as worried as I am.

675
00:40:44,334 --> 00:40:47,035
Are you gonna tell them?

676
00:40:49,372 --> 00:40:54,375
You need help, we'll help you.

677
00:40:54,377 --> 00:40:55,577
We're your family.

678
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:57,345
You can't.

679
00:40:59,149 --> 00:41:00,748
We care about you, Jack.

680
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,718
- No, just leave me alone.
- Jack.

681
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,953
Leave me alone.
Please, just...

682
00:41:04,955 --> 00:41:07,822
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!

683
00:41:07,824 --> 00:41:09,057
- Please.
- Leave me alone.

684
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:11,092
Leave me alone.

685
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,226
What's happening?

686
00:41:12,228 --> 00:41:14,395
- Leave me alone!
- What's going on?

687
00:41:14,397 --> 00:41:16,831
- Leave me alone!
- Jack, just...

688
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:18,433
Listen!

689
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:20,768
Jack? Please!

690
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,605
Listen to me!
Leave me alone!

691
00:41:27,077 --> 00:41:29,043
Mary?
