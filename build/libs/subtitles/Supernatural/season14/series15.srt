1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,199
You're keeping the snake?

2
00:00:01,598 --> 00:00:02,964
I didn't want
to leave it there.

3
00:00:03,368 --> 00:00:04,934
And I didn't want
to just kill it.

4
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:17,147
Michael's in there, and he is
fighting hard to get out.

5
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:20,616
I can't let my guard down,
not for a second.

6
00:00:20,618 --> 00:00:23,085
I was touched by God?

7
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:25,020
Or possibly
his sister, Amara.

8
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:26,889
Amara sucked out his soul.

9
00:00:26,891 --> 00:00:28,123
What did you do
to that boy?

10
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,692
When I cast
the transformation spell,

11
00:00:29,694 --> 00:00:31,259
I felt something else
pushing back.

12
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:32,695
Volatile magic --

13
00:00:32,697 --> 00:00:36,165
powerful and stitched to him
like some kind of parasite.

14
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:37,632
What is the good
of having these powers

15
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:39,534
if I can't help the people
that I love?

16
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:41,369
Michael. He's gone.

17
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:44,173
Hello, Rowena.
I'm looking for a new home.

18
00:00:44,175 --> 00:00:45,307
Say yes.

19
00:00:48,412 --> 00:00:51,413
I'm the son of Lucifer.
I am a Winchester!

20
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:54,049
You won't hurt anyone
ever again!

21
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,753
- Jack?
- I'm me again.

22
00:01:19,744 --> 00:01:21,877
Sunny?

23
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,812
Sunny?

24
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:26,482
Conrad?

25
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:30,552
What are you --
You have to go!

26
00:01:30,554 --> 00:01:32,554
I don't want to leave
without you.

27
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:36,091
I can't.
I made a promise.

28
00:01:37,328 --> 00:01:39,662
Conrad, go!
Please.

29
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:47,236
I love you.

30
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:17,366
- Phone! I need a phone!
- Whoa. Slow down.

31
00:02:17,368 --> 00:02:20,102
I need a phone!

32
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:21,670
Hey! That's my phone!

33
00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:23,005
Hey!

34
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:27,242
I'm gonna call 911!

35
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:35,918
Aaaaah!

36
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,294
Dude?

37
00:02:45,296 --> 00:02:47,429
Do you need help?

00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:19,028
Hey, Jack.

41
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,763
I'm good, Castiel.

42
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:24,200
Jack, you say that,

43
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:27,970
but ever since the Hunters
and their funerals...

44
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:37,580
How's the snake?

45
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:40,449
I don't think
he's feeling well.

46
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,152
He won't eat.

47
00:03:43,154 --> 00:03:45,421
Well, perhaps he misses
his previous owner.

48
00:03:45,423 --> 00:03:47,456
He's been through

49
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,326
a lot of change
in a short period of time.

50
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:54,897
I guess that's something
you have in common.

51
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:58,534
Jack, you killed Michael.

52
00:03:58,536 --> 00:04:00,169
You consumed his grace.

53
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:02,938
It was enough.

54
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,408
You have
your powers back?

55
00:04:08,646 --> 00:04:09,979
I think so.

56
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:24,427
I feel different now,
not like before,

57
00:04:24,429 --> 00:04:26,295
if that makes any sense.

58
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:28,764
And your soul?

59
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:36,172
You want to know
how much of my soul

60
00:04:36,174 --> 00:04:38,040
I had to burn off
to kill Michael.

61
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:39,442
Yes.

62
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:42,712
I don't know.

63
00:04:48,686 --> 00:04:51,120
I try not
to think about it.

64
00:05:10,074 --> 00:05:12,274
Oh. Thought you, uh,

65
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:14,577
were gonna sleep until
the cows dragged you home.

66
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:18,347
That's not the --
Never mind.

67
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:20,950
I was putting some gear away,
and Rowena called.

68
00:05:20,952 --> 00:05:22,451
How is she?

69
00:05:22,453 --> 00:05:24,854
Not great.
She's coping.

70
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:27,823
But, uh, you know,
at least she's not dead.

71
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:28,924
How's the kid?

72
00:05:28,926 --> 00:05:31,627
Well, he says
he's good, but...

73
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:32,795
What about Sam?

74
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:34,897
He says he's good.

75
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,033
I think they're both
full of crap.

76
00:05:57,755 --> 00:05:59,355
Sam!

77
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:24,580
Hey. Found us a case.
Arkansas.

78
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:28,918
We've just done three
back-to-back Hunts.

79
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,020
I need some rest.
At least a night.

80
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:32,188
We both do.

81
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:40,029
Yeah, well...
I'm leaving in ten.

82
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:42,097
Like I said, not good.

83
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:45,568
Maybe I should go with him.
And you can stay with Jack.

84
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,769
Why?

85
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:49,738
You were right.
Jack is struggling.

86
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,931
And I've tried, but --

87
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:52,299
Why do you think
he'll talk to me?

88
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:54,068
Well, because
he looks up to you.

89
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,571
And his soul -- I mean,
you've seen this before.

90
00:06:57,573 --> 00:06:59,974
No, no. No.
See, I was --

91
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:02,776
I was not great with Sam,
you know, when he was, uh...

92
00:07:02,778 --> 00:07:04,912
But Jack's soul
isn't completely gone.

93
00:07:04,914 --> 00:07:07,047
At least I don't think so.

94
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:08,849
W-We just don't know
how much is left.

95
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:11,252
Well, how am <i>I</i> supposed to
figure that out?

96
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:12,519
I don't know!

97
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:15,122
Just talk to him.
Get him to open up.

98
00:07:15,124 --> 00:07:18,459
And then...

99
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:20,327
Sleep until the cows
come home.

100
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:23,030
- There it is.
- That's the saying.

101
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:50,224
So we're looking
for a witch?

102
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:55,429
Exploding heads.
sounds like a witch.

103
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:56,530
Or a demon.

104
00:07:56,532 --> 00:07:58,699
Maybe.

105
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:01,568
Sam...

106
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,771
I'm good.
I'm good, honestly.

107
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:05,506
Yeah, I know.
Everybody's good.

108
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:08,042
But after this, maybe...

109
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:09,710
Dean's right.
You need to rest.

110
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:12,446
Can't.
Just because I'm tired

111
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:14,882
doesn't mean the monsters
are gonna stop, you know?

112
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:17,384
Doesn't mean anything.
Plus...

113
00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:19,753
we don't have as many Hunters
as we used to.

114
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,024
- Excuse me. Griffin?
- Yeah?

115
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:25,626
- Griffin Tate?
- Mm-hmm.

116
00:08:25,628 --> 00:08:28,896
Agent Scholz.
This is Agent Delp.

117
00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:33,167
We're, uh, FBI.
We're here about the incident.

118
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,736
"Incident"? <i>That's</i> what
we're calling it?

119
00:08:35,738 --> 00:08:38,005
Well...

120
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:39,707
what would <i>you</i>
call it?

121
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:42,609
Insane! This guy --

122
00:08:42,611 --> 00:08:45,012
- You mean Conrad Martin.
- Right.

123
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:47,915
He comes in looking like
he's been running all night,

124
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:51,285
asks for my phone,
then he just...

125
00:08:53,723 --> 00:08:55,689
...went all "Scanners."

126
00:08:55,691 --> 00:08:59,226
Was it more "Scanners"
1, 2, or 3?

127
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:01,962
Never mind that.

128
00:09:01,964 --> 00:09:04,932
Um, this Conrad Martin.
Did you know him?

129
00:09:04,934 --> 00:09:08,802
No, but he was probably
from Charming Acres.

130
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:09,903
He had that "look."

131
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:11,605
Charming Acres?

132
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:13,307
About five miles
up the road.

133
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:18,045
But it's weird.

134
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:21,248
Weird how?

135
00:09:43,572 --> 00:09:46,640
Good day!
Good day to you!

136
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:49,309
- Hey, Carl.
- Hi, there. Nice to see you!

137
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,911
- This is...
- Yeah.

138
00:09:50,913 --> 00:09:54,915
It's like we're stepping into
a <i>Saturday Evening Post.</i>

139
00:09:59,455 --> 00:10:04,258
I look at them sometimes after
you fall asleep at night.

140
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,692
They're very soothing.

141
00:10:08,364 --> 00:10:09,663
Should we call Dean?

142
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:13,734
I mean, I've been trying,
but...no bars.

143
00:10:13,736 --> 00:10:16,170
Guess this place really is
the middle of nowhere.

144
00:10:16,172 --> 00:10:18,205
All right.
Let's get to it.

145
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:21,008
- Whoa, Nelly! Excuse us.
- Sorry.

146
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,376
You know what?
A-Actually...

147
00:10:22,378 --> 00:10:24,511
I'm sorry.
D-Do you have a moment?

148
00:10:24,513 --> 00:10:27,214
Well, we're on our way
to the bake sale.

149
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:31,285
We're FBI. We're looking into
a death that happened near here.

150
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:33,787
Wowee!
A couple of G-Men, huh?

151
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:37,191
Well, I'm Justin Smith, and
this is my foxy wife, Cindy.

152
00:10:37,193 --> 00:10:39,326
Sweetie, we are
going to be late.

153
00:10:39,328 --> 00:10:40,828
Oh, sorry, Agent.

154
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,663
I haven't heard
about anyone dying,

155
00:10:42,665 --> 00:10:45,766
but, uh,
ask at Harrington's.

156
00:10:45,768 --> 00:10:47,601
And try a milkshake.
They're the best!

157
00:10:48,838 --> 00:10:50,704
Say, what's that
ya got there?

158
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:53,273
Strawberry jam...

159
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:55,042
My...cellphone?

160
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:58,178
Huh.
"Cell...phone."

161
00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:00,914
Honey, my cakes
are getting cold.

162
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:07,421
Huh. Cell...phone.
A cell phone?

163
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:08,989
What was that?

164
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:12,192
Maybe they're Mormon?

165
00:11:12,194 --> 00:11:16,096
? ...why we're so far apart ?

166
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:21,969
? You made your world ?

167
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:26,840
? Out of vows that are broken ?

168
00:11:26,842 --> 00:11:27,941
Hi!

169
00:11:27,943 --> 00:11:30,611
? I built a world
in my heart ?

170
00:11:30,613 --> 00:11:32,746
This is weird.

171
00:11:32,748 --> 00:11:35,782
Yeah. Little bit.
All right. Come on.

172
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:39,953
? Everyone here
tried to warn me ?

173
00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:43,357
Oh, that's the fella.
Oh, I couldn't!

174
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:45,425
Sweetheart, can you make sure
we get some more root beer?

175
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:48,195
Already sent
the order, Pops.

176
00:11:48,197 --> 00:11:49,563
Here you go.

177
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:51,598
Oh, no. Sorry.
We didn't order --

178
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,201
First one's free.
Everyone loves the milkshakes.

179
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:56,904
Oh. Thanks.

180
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,477
Wow. That is, uh...

181
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:06,380
Delicious.

182
00:12:06,382 --> 00:12:08,582
- See?
- Sunny, can you make me a --

183
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:11,118
A banana split with extra cherries for
Miss Lewis, coming up!

184
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,787
You know, I would lose my mind
if it wasn't for that girl.

185
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:17,324
You must be the flatfoots
I keep hearing about.

186
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:21,395
"Keep"? We've barely
been here five minutes.

187
00:12:21,397 --> 00:12:23,263
It's a small town.

188
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:25,165
Chip Harrington.
I'm the mayor.

189
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:26,733
Mayor? Oh.

190
00:12:26,735 --> 00:12:30,571
Um, it's a...nice town
you got here, Mayor.

191
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:32,673
Yeah, I know what
you're thinking.

192
00:12:32,675 --> 00:12:34,641
We're a little bit
old-fashioned, huh?

193
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:37,511
You know,
people who live here --

194
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:42,316
well, we take care
of each other.

195
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:46,453
We're here about
Conrad Martin.

196
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:48,121
I don't know
if you heard...

197
00:12:48,123 --> 00:12:50,724
I have.
Poor kid.

198
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:52,559
You know,
the police came by.

199
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:56,530
They said something about
an aneurysm or something?

200
00:12:56,532 --> 00:12:59,066
Oh, no.
His head exploded.

201
00:12:59,068 --> 00:13:00,467
Wh--

202
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,607
I'm sorry?

203
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:08,709
Like a ripe melon
on the sun.

204
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:12,212
Okay. Uh, you know what?
We, uh --

205
00:13:12,214 --> 00:13:15,549
We're just looking to find out
everything we can about him.

206
00:13:16,518 --> 00:13:19,119
Yeah, well, uh, I can point you
to where he was staying.

207
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:21,855
Would that help?
That'll work.

208
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:33,967
"Like a ripe melon
on the sun"?

209
00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:35,902
It was an apt metaphor.

210
00:13:35,904 --> 00:13:37,504
Okay, well,
maybe next time

211
00:13:37,506 --> 00:13:40,207
try to be a little less...apt.

212
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:41,975
Oh.

213
00:13:48,183 --> 00:13:51,385
The entire town is so
strangely picturesque.

214
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:54,321
Yeah, it's kind of nice.
All right. Here's the plan.

215
00:13:54,323 --> 00:13:58,558
We go in, sweep for sulfur,
hex bags. You know, the usual.

216
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,993
Okay.

217
00:13:59,995 --> 00:14:02,362
Good afternoon, Agents.

218
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,034
Agents?
Were you expecting us?

219
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:10,170
Small town.
Come on in.

220
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:12,906
Sure. Thanks.

221
00:14:31,093 --> 00:14:32,959
What, you setting up
a science project?

222
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:35,295
I'm trying different foods
for the snake.

223
00:14:35,297 --> 00:14:37,097
Why?

224
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:38,598
I think he's sad.

225
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:42,869
Oh. Have you tried bacon?

226
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,306
Do snakes like bacon?

227
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:48,608
I don't know.

228
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,377
I like bacon.

229
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:55,816
Well, anyway,
you and the, uh, snake...

230
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,987
...want to go
for a little dri-ive?

231
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:02,289
You mean a Hunt.

232
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:06,159
Uh, more like
a field trip.

233
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:08,395
Okay.

234
00:15:08,397 --> 00:15:10,263
Yeah. Good. All right.

235
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:13,166
I'm gonna make some bacon now.

236
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:19,573
Would you like
some bacon?

237
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:25,746
This is Conrad's room.
He was such a nice young man.

238
00:15:25,748 --> 00:15:28,348
Oh, what happened to him
is a shame.

239
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,076
Mm.

240
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,109
He'd only been in town
for a few weeks.

241
00:15:32,187 --> 00:15:33,820
Do you have many people
come through here?

242
00:15:33,822 --> 00:15:37,758
Not people. Men.
I only rent to young men.

243
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,361
It's not proper --
young women living alone?

244
00:15:41,363 --> 00:15:45,165
Morals.
You got to have morals.

245
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:48,101
You know.

246
00:15:50,472 --> 00:15:53,807
Ms. Dowling?
May I have some coffee, please?

247
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:56,443
Of course, dear.

248
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:28,942
- Hey. What'd you find?
- Hey.

249
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:31,645
Love letters that were under
the bed. They're from Sunny.

250
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:34,414
Sunny. Sunny,
the milkshake waitress?

251
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,684
Yeah, and they're...
surprisingly passionate.

252
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:39,186
Passionate how?

253
00:16:39,188 --> 00:16:42,456
She spends, uh,
quite a bit of time

254
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,625
talking about the -- the shape
and the heft of his --

255
00:16:45,627 --> 00:16:46,960
Okay!

256
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:50,230
Got it, yep, passionate.
Understood.

257
00:16:50,232 --> 00:16:53,366
Well, I say we should definitely
check that out tomorrow.

258
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:54,534
Tomorrow?

259
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:57,771
Yeah.
It's getting late, Cass.

260
00:16:57,773 --> 00:17:00,307
And you're right.
I-I probably need some rest.

261
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:02,843
You want to stay here?

262
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:04,778
Why not?

263
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,514
Ms. Dowling's
making pot roast.

264
00:17:11,286 --> 00:17:14,921
Justin.
Cell phone. Cell.

265
00:17:14,923 --> 00:17:17,424
Cell phone.

266
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:20,126
Is something wrong,
darling?

267
00:17:21,563 --> 00:17:25,465
I -- I bought
a cell phone.

268
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:26,867
Hmm?

269
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:29,336
In Houston.

270
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:31,805
For my daughter.

271
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:33,673
Daughter?

272
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:37,811
My daughter. Rose.

273
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:39,779
My daughter -- My --

274
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,416
Who are you?

275
00:17:44,553 --> 00:17:46,853
What am I doing here?

276
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:48,455
What?

277
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:54,694
This --
This isn't my house!

278
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:00,800
Honey?

279
00:18:03,972 --> 00:18:07,440
Help! Help!
Somebody help me!

280
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:10,410
Help! Help me!

281
00:18:10,412 --> 00:18:14,114
Aah! Ohh! Help me!

282
00:18:14,116 --> 00:18:16,149
Aaaah!

283
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:22,289
Honey?

284
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,850
Why don't you grub up? We still
got another couple hours.

285
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,954
I'm not really hungry.

286
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,791
Well, maybe feed
the snake something.

287
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:47,025
Yeah. Here.

288
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:52,197
Give him one of these. I bet
he's never had that before.

289
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:58,570
I don't think you have a firm
grasp on what snakes eat.

290
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:00,138
Yeah, no.

291
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,374
Yeah, I always thought they
were kind of cool, though.

292
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:05,978
Well, most people think
they're dangerous.

293
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:11,216
Mm. Well, it's not the snake
that's dangerous.

294
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:14,453
It's their...bite.

295
00:19:14,455 --> 00:19:17,089
Is -- Is that a saying?

296
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:19,191
It is now.

297
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:23,428
<i>You</i> try one of those.

298
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,696
Great.

299
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:58,730
Sam?

300
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:09,941
Sam?

301
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,750
Excuse me.

302
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:22,988
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

303
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,023
? <i>He's my guy,</i>
<i>and I love him truly</i> ?

304
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:26,458
Ma'am?

305
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,160
? <i>He's not good-lookin',</i>
<i>heaven knows</i> ?

306
00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:29,861
? <i>But I'm wild about</i>
<i>his fancy clothes</i> ?

307
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:31,463
HELLO?!

308
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:33,265
? <i>He wears tan shoes</i>
<i>with pink shoelaces</i> ?

309
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:35,467
Oh. hello, dear.
Good morning.

310
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:38,403
A-Are you hungry?
I made some johnnycakes.

311
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,739
No, I don't eat.
I'm looking for my partner.

312
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:45,343
Oh. The very nice,
the very tall fella?

313
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:46,445
Yes.

314
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:49,581
Hm. He said he's
going for a walk.

315
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,117
And a milkshake.

316
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,220
? <i>We go to drive-in movies</i>
<i>in a limousine</i> ?

317
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:58,590
? <i>He's got a whirly-birdy</i>
<i>and a 12-foot yacht</i> ?

318
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,525
? <i>Ah, but that's...</i> ?

319
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:19,911
? He's got tan shoes
with pink shoelaces ?

320
00:21:19,913 --> 00:21:22,180
A polka-dot vest
and man, oh, man

321
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:25,517
? He wears tan shoes
with pink shoelaces ?

322
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,153
Oh! Hi!
Uh, welcome to Harrington's.

323
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:29,354
How can I help you?

324
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:30,822
I'm looking
for my partner.

325
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:31,990
Who?

326
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:34,726
The man I came in with
yesterday.

327
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:37,395
Oh, the tall man.

328
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:39,664
Yes, the very tall man.

329
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,501
I -- He was here
a little while ago.

330
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:44,136
And do you know
where he is now?

331
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:46,471
Uh, he left when, um...

332
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:50,876
When what?

333
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:53,245
You heard what happened
to Mr. Smith?

334
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:55,347
What happened
to Mr. Smith?

335
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:10,962
Oh! Agent!

336
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:12,130
Mrs. Smith.

337
00:22:12,132 --> 00:22:14,666
Please. Come in.

338
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:16,735
Thank you.

339
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,177
Would you like
a martini?

340
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:26,478
Uh, no, thank you.

341
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,712
I, um...

342
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:31,449
I don't mean to
bother you, but I'm, uh --

343
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:33,752
I'm looking
for my partner.

344
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:37,055
The tall man.

345
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:42,961
Hair?
He has beautiful hair?

346
00:22:42,963 --> 00:22:45,297
What?

347
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,435
Uhh.
This is complicated.

348
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:55,173
Mrs. Smith.

349
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:57,075
NO!!

350
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:03,215
That's my husband's chair.

351
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:07,686
Okay, um,
I think my partner

352
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:09,721
wanted to talk to you
about your husband.

353
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,223
Justin?
What about him?

354
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:16,561
I'm so sorry, but last night,
his head, um --

355
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:19,898
Your husband --
he died last night.

356
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:26,905
Ohh. I think
you're confused.

357
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,140
Have you already had
your martini today?

358
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:33,011
N-No, I'm -- I'm not.

359
00:23:33,013 --> 00:23:34,179
He really died.

360
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:37,716
No, my husband,
he's good.

361
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:39,050
No, he's not.

362
00:23:39,052 --> 00:23:40,518
Honey?

363
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:45,590
Is something wrong?

364
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,960
Oh, hi, there.

365
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:50,362
Agent.

366
00:23:50,364 --> 00:23:53,999
Justin. Justin Smith.
And you are?

367
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:57,102
Your partner.

368
00:23:57,104 --> 00:24:00,605
Y-- Partner?
Huh! Super!

369
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,874
That's swell. Great.
Tell you what.

370
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:06,878
Why don't you stick around?
We're having pot roast.

371
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:15,220
Honey.

372
00:24:15,222 --> 00:24:18,023
Make me a martini?

373
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,497
Who does she think
you are?

374
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:29,100
Well,
I'm her husband, of course.

375
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,438
This is not your house.

376
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,911
I see. You're right.

377
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:43,848
This is my wife's house.
I am simply living here.

378
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,984
- Oh, you!
- Oh, <i>you!</i>

379
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,086
Oh, no.

380
00:24:48,088 --> 00:24:50,221
Something terrible's
happened.

381
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:54,092
Hon, we're low
on olives.

382
00:24:54,094 --> 00:24:55,827
- Well, that <i>is</i> terrible.
- One or two?

383
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,329
Uh, three?

384
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:00,732
I'm feeling adventurous.

385
00:25:00,734 --> 00:25:02,300
Rowr!

386
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:04,436
Rar.

387
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:09,207
Would you like one?

388
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:12,677
Your name
is Sam Winchester.

389
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,513
So that's a no-no on the hooch?

390
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,382
Sam, I don't know
what's happened.

391
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:19,617
I don't know if this is a spell or a curse
or -- or what's happened,

392
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:23,355
but you will snap
the hell out of it!

393
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:26,358
Sir, you watch your mouth.

394
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,927
If we cannot remain civil,
then you can skedaddle.

395
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:30,895
- Sam --
- That's not my name!

396
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:33,965
- Cindy, grab his hat!
- I don't wear a hat!

397
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,677
Honey, I don't
think he wore a hat!

398
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,936
Fine!

399
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:42,707
Sir, using language like, uh,
"H-E-double hockey sticks" --

400
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:45,477
You should have your mouth
washed out with soap.

401
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,511
Sam --

402
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:49,180
- It's Justin.
- I'm gonna --

403
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:55,620
Double hockey sticks?

404
00:26:11,478 --> 00:26:13,412
Dean!

405
00:26:13,414 --> 00:26:15,080
Jack!
Great to see you!

406
00:26:15,082 --> 00:26:17,316
Donny, good to see you
up and around.

407
00:26:17,318 --> 00:26:19,384
Ah, I am just
the picture of health.

408
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:22,955
Except for my prostate.
It's shaped like a papaya.

409
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,890
Wow.

410
00:26:24,892 --> 00:26:27,259
Our field trip
is to see Donatello?

411
00:26:27,261 --> 00:26:31,530
Well, with this whole
soul thing, it's, uh --

412
00:26:31,532 --> 00:26:34,099
We're worried
about you, okay?

413
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:37,502
And when it comes to souls
or...not having them,

414
00:26:37,504 --> 00:26:39,071
Donny here's an expert.

415
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:43,075
He is?

416
00:26:43,077 --> 00:26:44,943
Please.
Come on in.

417
00:26:44,945 --> 00:26:46,545
Actually, you know what?
I'm gonna --

418
00:26:46,547 --> 00:26:47,879
I'm gonna
let you guys talk.

419
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:49,881
I'll, uh, keep an eye
on the snake.

420
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:54,086
Okay.
Come on, Jack.

421
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,720
So, you took this snake in,

422
00:27:28,722 --> 00:27:30,956
and now it gets to go
on road trips?

423
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:33,592
Fun!

424
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:36,862
Can I ask you something?

425
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,764
That's what you're here for,
isn't it?

426
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:42,501
How did you lose
your soul?

427
00:27:44,104 --> 00:27:46,571
God's sister ripped it
right out of me.

428
00:27:46,573 --> 00:27:51,276
That...
wasn't my best day.

429
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:55,414
But oddly, it wasn't
my worst day, either.

430
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:02,020
And when it was gone,

431
00:28:02,022 --> 00:28:04,523
how did you --
how'd you feel?

432
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:06,692
Like...

433
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,332
...the galaxy.

434
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:19,905
You know, Jack,
our galaxy's

435
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:23,875
all bright and shiny
and spinny,

436
00:28:23,877 --> 00:28:30,048
but in its center lies
this very large black hole.

437
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,256
It's the same with me.

438
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,259
I'm all bright and shiny,
obviously --

439
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,830
Not so much spinny.

440
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:46,298
But inside?

441
00:28:49,503 --> 00:28:50,669
Empty.

442
00:28:50,671 --> 00:28:53,538
So you feel bad?

443
00:28:55,342 --> 00:28:58,477
I feel...

444
00:28:58,479 --> 00:28:59,711
nothing.

445
00:28:59,713 --> 00:29:03,048
Losing your soul
doesn't make you bad.

446
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,950
It doesn't
make you anything.

447
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:07,853
It's, um...

448
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:10,322
an absence of...

449
00:29:10,324 --> 00:29:13,992
of pity, of empathy...

450
00:29:15,596 --> 00:29:17,229
...of humanity.

451
00:29:23,337 --> 00:29:24,803
How do you feel, Jack?

452
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,079
I don't know.

453
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:37,916
I know I don't
feel...nothing,

454
00:29:37,918 --> 00:29:42,921
but I don't feel
the same, either.

455
00:29:42,923 --> 00:29:47,626
And maybe I just don't know
what nothing feels like.

456
00:29:49,863 --> 00:29:53,932
Mostly, I just don't want Sam
and Dean and Cass to worry.

457
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:57,836
They're your family.
Families worry.

458
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:01,540
But I just --
I need time and space

459
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:03,809
to figure things out
on my own,

460
00:30:03,811 --> 00:30:04,960
but everywhere I go,

461
00:30:04,984 --> 00:30:06,984
there's someone looking
over my shoulder.

462
00:30:07,314 --> 00:30:09,347
Ah.

463
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:14,886
When I need to, uh, "blend,"
I ask myself,

464
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:17,155
"What would
Mr. Rogers do?"

465
00:30:18,492 --> 00:30:20,091
Who's Mr. Rogers?

466
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:22,460
The best man I know.

467
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:27,432
Sam and Dean
are the best men I know.

468
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:31,369
So, ergo, whenever you don't
want them to worry,

469
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:35,707
just think "WWWD" --

470
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,776
"What Would
the Winchesters Do?"

471
00:30:37,778 --> 00:30:41,112
I can do that.

472
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,090
Well, there they are.

473
00:30:52,092 --> 00:30:53,491
How's the snake?

474
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:55,627
He's good.
Might be hungry.

475
00:30:55,629 --> 00:30:57,162
Okay.

476
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,134
So, what's the verdict?
Does he have a soul?

477
00:31:03,136 --> 00:31:07,372
I suppose the first question
we must ask ourselves is,

478
00:31:07,374 --> 00:31:08,673
what <i>is</i> a soul?

479
00:31:08,675 --> 00:31:09,975
Donny.

480
00:31:09,977 --> 00:31:11,142
What?

481
00:31:11,144 --> 00:31:13,812
I'm sorry.

482
00:31:13,814 --> 00:31:16,948
Um, I'd keep an eye on him,

483
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,987
but I think if he seems okay,
he probably is.

484
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,422
So he's not like you?

485
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,124
Oh, no.

486
00:31:26,126 --> 00:31:28,793
I'm a Prophet of the Lord,
but he --

487
00:31:30,664 --> 00:31:35,901
Jack's probably the most
powerful being in the universe.

488
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:41,606
I mean, really, who knows
what's going on inside his head?

489
00:31:51,718 --> 00:31:53,718
Thanks.

490
00:32:04,197 --> 00:32:05,997
I think we should talk.

491
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:08,833
I, uh --
Okay. About what?

492
00:32:08,835 --> 00:32:10,835
About how you're a witch.

493
00:32:10,837 --> 00:32:12,570
A witch?

494
00:32:12,572 --> 00:32:14,272
About how you
brainwashed my friend

495
00:32:14,274 --> 00:32:17,442
and about how you've done
something to this entire town.

496
00:32:17,444 --> 00:32:19,978
I don't know what
you're talking about.

497
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,579
Oh, yes, you do.

498
00:32:21,581 --> 00:32:23,081
You wrote these.

499
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,585
You wrote them to Conrad.

500
00:32:27,587 --> 00:32:33,525
And between various
steamy, erotic musings,

501
00:32:33,527 --> 00:32:35,860
you begged him to leave.

502
00:32:35,862 --> 00:32:38,697
Why is that? Because you
were afraid you'd hurt him?

503
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:40,465
You don't know what
you're talking about.

504
00:32:40,467 --> 00:32:41,733
Okay, then tell me.

505
00:32:44,104 --> 00:32:48,039
Tell me, or I'll rip it
from your mind.

506
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,376
Fine.

507
00:32:51,378 --> 00:32:53,011
Have it your way.

508
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:56,314
No, no, please! It's not me!
It's him! He's out of control!

509
00:32:56,316 --> 00:33:00,185
Well, now...

510
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,953
That's not very nice.

511
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:10,907
So <i>you</i> did this.

512
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:12,676
What, did you think
it was the milkshakes?

513
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:15,779
What are you?

514
00:33:15,781 --> 00:33:18,782
Well, I like to think of myself
as a kind of Good Samaritan.

515
00:33:18,784 --> 00:33:20,450
You know, I've always been
lucky. I've always had

516
00:33:20,452 --> 00:33:23,854
an intuition about what people
are gonna do or say.

517
00:33:23,856 --> 00:33:26,390
Made me the king
of poker night.

518
00:33:26,392 --> 00:33:29,793
But then the mill shut down,

519
00:33:29,795 --> 00:33:34,131
and this town -- the town
I love -- had started to die.

520
00:33:34,133 --> 00:33:36,867
Then my sweet wife,
she passed away.

521
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:38,735
And the world kept
gettin' worse,

522
00:33:38,737 --> 00:33:40,537
and they called it
"modernization,"

523
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:42,305
and no matter what I did,
people would turn

524
00:33:42,307 --> 00:33:45,208
to drink or drugs,
they'd move away.

525
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,078
They just weren't happy.

526
00:33:50,349 --> 00:33:52,482
Things kept getting worse,

527
00:33:52,484 --> 00:33:55,318
and I started to hear
noises -- voices.

528
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,120
And I screamed
at these voices!

529
00:33:57,122 --> 00:34:02,659
I said, "Just make
things better!"

530
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:04,361
And you know
what happened next?

531
00:34:04,363 --> 00:34:07,130
No, but I have a feeling
you're gonna tell me.

532
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,803
The very next day, I thought --
just thought --

533
00:34:12,805 --> 00:34:15,739
"I wish there was more people
in the soda shop."

534
00:34:15,741 --> 00:34:19,876
And I came in here that day,
and it was packed.

535
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:24,748
And that's when
I figured it out.

536
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:30,086
I can make people do
whatever I want.

537
00:34:30,088 --> 00:34:32,989
So you're some kind of
mind-control psychic?

538
00:34:35,327 --> 00:34:37,761
I re-made this town.

539
00:34:37,763 --> 00:34:41,298
I gave everybody
new names, new lives.

540
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,733
I made everybody happy.

541
00:34:43,735 --> 00:34:47,604
Well, most everybody, and, uh,
the ones who fought it, well --

542
00:34:47,606 --> 00:34:49,306
You'd murder them.

543
00:34:50,843 --> 00:34:53,977
I was just
protecting my home!

544
00:34:53,979 --> 00:34:55,912
And you -- you knew
all about this.

545
00:34:55,914 --> 00:34:59,082
Well, she knew enough
to play along,

546
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:02,986
but, uh...my tricks
never worked on Sunny.

547
00:35:02,988 --> 00:35:06,389
She's too much like me.

548
00:35:06,391 --> 00:35:10,660
I am <i>nothing</i> like you.

549
00:35:12,397 --> 00:35:16,166
But you.
Why can't I change you?

550
00:35:16,168 --> 00:35:17,801
Because I'm not human.

551
00:35:18,837 --> 00:35:21,705
Oh.

552
00:35:21,707 --> 00:35:23,607
Well...

553
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:25,375
Gentlemen?

554
00:35:25,377 --> 00:35:26,676
Sunny!

555
00:35:28,013 --> 00:35:30,180
- Sunny!
-Get away from me!

556
00:35:30,182 --> 00:35:31,681
I won't hurt you, Sam.

557
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:34,918
Golly, I told you
my name is Justin!

558
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:45,529
- You killed Conrad!
- No!

559
00:35:45,531 --> 00:35:48,632
You told him the truth,
and that's why he ran,

560
00:35:48,634 --> 00:35:50,600
and that's why I did
what I had to do.

561
00:35:50,602 --> 00:35:53,036
No, you killed that boy, Sunny,
not me.

562
00:35:53,038 --> 00:35:54,404
I didn't.

563
00:36:01,947 --> 00:36:03,446
Aah!

564
00:36:15,561 --> 00:36:16,960
Fight this!

565
00:36:16,962 --> 00:36:20,363
Why? I'm happy
in Charming Acres.

566
00:36:20,365 --> 00:36:21,631
We're <i>all</i> happy.

567
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:23,934
Sam, I know
you want to be happy.

568
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,304
And I know what it's like
to lose your army.

569
00:36:27,306 --> 00:36:29,105
I know what it's like...

570
00:36:29,107 --> 00:36:31,741
...to fail
as a leader, Sam.

571
00:36:31,743 --> 00:36:34,778
But you can't lose yourself.
You have to keep fighting.

572
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,414
You can't lose yourself,
because if you do, you fail us.

573
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:40,984
You fail all of those
that we've lost.

574
00:36:40,986 --> 00:36:42,385
You fail Jack.

575
00:36:42,387 --> 00:36:45,455
Sam, you fail Dean.

576
00:36:48,794 --> 00:36:50,193
You're sick.

577
00:36:50,195 --> 00:36:53,496
Well, but you stayed.
You didn't even try and stop me.

578
00:36:59,104 --> 00:37:01,938
- Sam.
- Cass?

579
00:37:03,475 --> 00:37:07,577
I promised Mom that I wouldn't
leave you, but you're a monster.

580
00:37:08,747 --> 00:37:10,780
No. No.

581
00:37:10,782 --> 00:37:13,116
In this town, I'm God.

582
00:37:13,852 --> 00:37:18,254
No. You're not.
Believe me. We've met God.

583
00:37:18,256 --> 00:37:19,889
God has a beard.

584
00:37:27,165 --> 00:37:29,366
No!

585
00:37:32,704 --> 00:37:34,604
Sorry, sport.

586
00:37:34,606 --> 00:37:36,806
Stop!

587
00:37:38,076 --> 00:37:39,909
I said stop!

588
00:37:51,523 --> 00:37:55,859
You see? I told you!
You're just like me!

589
00:37:55,861 --> 00:37:59,963
No. You hurt
innocent people.

590
00:37:59,965 --> 00:38:03,199
You want to be happy?

591
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:05,769
Then be happy!

592
00:38:12,711 --> 00:38:14,678
W-What did you do?

593
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,615
I -- I don't --

594
00:38:18,617 --> 00:38:20,016
I...

595
00:38:24,623 --> 00:38:26,289
She made him happy.

596
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:29,993
Your father is trapped
inside his own mind.

597
00:38:30,862 --> 00:38:33,396
He's in a world that --

598
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,267
It's a beautiful world.

599
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:40,570
But it's a place where he can
never hurt anyone again.

600
00:38:45,444 --> 00:38:47,510
Good.

601
00:38:56,389 --> 00:38:58,356
Well, it seemed like
the snake enjoyed the trip.

602
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:01,192
Hard to say.
He's, uh, very guarded.

603
00:39:01,194 --> 00:39:03,094
Yeah. Yeah.

604
00:39:04,731 --> 00:39:07,265
And what about you, huh?
Good time?

605
00:39:08,401 --> 00:39:11,869
It was...illuminating.

606
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,772
Oh.

607
00:39:20,847 --> 00:39:23,548
Hey! How was Arkansas?

608
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,150
Arkansas was, uh...

609
00:39:28,555 --> 00:39:31,289
It was...weird.

610
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:33,124
Heard you wore
a cardigan.

611
00:39:35,929 --> 00:39:38,196
Yeah, I told him
about the cardigan.

612
00:39:38,198 --> 00:39:39,897
Great. Thanks.

613
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:41,065
And the wife.

614
00:39:42,702 --> 00:39:45,903
He said you were,
uh, really happy.

615
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:48,039
Thanks. Yeah.

616
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:50,108
Where's Jack?

617
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,209
His room.

618
00:39:54,648 --> 00:39:57,148
Really happy, huh?

619
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,450
I mean, I guess
I was happy, but...

620
00:39:59,452 --> 00:40:02,620
It wasn't real, you know?

621
00:40:02,622 --> 00:40:04,689
Just...

622
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:09,160
Well, not a lot of happy
goin' on around here.

623
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,732
I hate this place
right now.

624
00:40:14,734 --> 00:40:16,534
I hate it.

625
00:40:16,536 --> 00:40:18,903
Everywhere I look,
I see them.

626
00:40:18,905 --> 00:40:20,238
I see Maggie.

627
00:40:21,374 --> 00:40:24,509
I guess that's why, uh --
why I was so desperate

628
00:40:24,511 --> 00:40:27,378
to get out of here,
why I kept running us ragged.

629
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:33,418
But I got to stop that.
I-I can't keep running. I --

630
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:39,957
This is my home.
This is our home.

631
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,930
Dean, I think
I just need some time.

632
00:40:49,402 --> 00:40:50,668
Okay.

633
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:05,850
Cass says
you miss your friend.

634
00:41:05,852 --> 00:41:08,386
You need help.

635
00:41:08,388 --> 00:41:13,257
Sam and Dean would help you,
so -- so I'll help you.

636
00:41:15,528 --> 00:41:18,730
I'll help you
see your friend again.

637
00:41:22,168 --> 00:41:23,901
In Heaven.
