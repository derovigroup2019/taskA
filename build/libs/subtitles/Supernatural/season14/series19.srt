1
00:00:00,619 --> 00:00:03,004
Stacy!

2
00:00:03,047 --> 00:00:05,615
We knew Jack was dangerous.
We always knew.

3
00:00:05,658 --> 00:00:07,312
Jack, stop.

4
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:12,709
- So, what do we do?
- We fight.

5
00:00:14,232 --> 00:00:15,973
I killed Mary.

6
00:00:17,235 --> 00:00:19,063
- You're dead to me.
- I failed you.

7
00:00:19,107 --> 00:00:20,151
And I failed Jack.

8
00:00:20,195 --> 00:00:22,327
Go to Heaven and find her!

9
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:26,679
- Where's Naomi?
- Castiel, run!

10
00:00:26,723 --> 00:00:27,985
It's none of your business.

11
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:29,769
- I'm looking for someone.
- Mary Winchester?

12
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:31,815
There may be a way
to bring her back.

13
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:34,252
- "Necromantiorum."
- I don't want your help.

14
00:00:34,296 --> 00:00:36,472
I'm your, you know,
subconscious or whatever.

15
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:38,561
Y-You whipped me up to
help you figure this out.

16
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:40,519
You know it's not gonna work.
Admit it.

17
00:00:40,563 --> 00:00:42,260
You don't feel anything anymore.

18
00:00:42,304 --> 00:00:45,089
Jack is using magic
to bring your mom back.

19
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:49,137
It didn't work.

20
00:01:26,913 --> 00:01:29,090
We know it wasn't easy
for some of you to get here,

21
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:31,222
and we thank you.

22
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:33,006
We, uh...

23
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,879
We gave her a Hunter's send-off
a few days ago.

24
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:40,492
But we know that her family
went beyond just us.

25
00:01:40,536 --> 00:01:43,974
Some of you Hunted
alongside her.

26
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:46,977
Some of you fought Michael
with her in the other world.

27
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,762
You know,
we lost our mom once before.

28
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:54,158
But we got a second chance
with her.

29
00:01:54,202 --> 00:01:58,293
And we got to know her
not just as "Mom," but...

30
00:01:58,336 --> 00:02:04,255
as someone who was tough
and strong.

31
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,691
Stubborn as Hell.

32
00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:11,654
Someone who had opinions
and wasn't shy to use them.

33
00:02:14,526 --> 00:02:17,486
She could handle a machete.

34
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:20,924
She could handle a vampire.

35
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:23,187
She could handle our old man.

36
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:27,974
She couldn't cook worth a damn.

37
00:02:31,804 --> 00:02:35,634
Mom, you weren't here
long enough.

38
00:02:35,678 --> 00:02:37,680
But we're, uh...

39
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:43,555
We're so glad
for the time that we had.

40
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:48,691
Goodbye, Mom.

41
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:50,475
Bye, Mom.

42
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,174
To Mary.

43
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:16,360

44
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:25,510
Make sure I get my hatchet back.

45
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:29,035
Damn wraith.

46
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,777
Knew him from a nest
your mom and I busted up

47
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:33,649
on our last Hunt.

48
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:36,260
Probably here to gloat.
The bastard.

49
00:03:36,304 --> 00:03:38,393
Thanks for coming out.

50
00:03:38,436 --> 00:03:42,266
A Hunter's memorial,
complete with monster.

51
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,921
Mary would have
appreciated that.

52
00:03:44,964 --> 00:03:49,273
Now that you mention it, yeah.

53
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:50,709
How are you?

54
00:03:51,623 --> 00:03:54,800
Hey, you know. It's tough.

55
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:57,499
And the other one?

56
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:04,636
Yeah, Dean...
seems to be doing okay.

57
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,768
Hard to say.

58
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,944
Yeah.

59
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:09,815
Maybe he's like me.

60
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:14,211
Bein' teary in public's
not my style.

61
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:23,133
Hey. Uh, most
everybody's headed out,

62
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:25,440
but Bobby's gonna stick around.

63
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:29,705
I thought maybe we could open
that Scotch Ketch left and...

64
00:04:29,748 --> 00:04:31,097
hang out, talk about Mom.

65
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:32,838
"Talk about Mom"?

66
00:04:32,882 --> 00:04:34,318
Yeah.

67
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:36,799
Isn't that what we've beendoing?

68
00:04:57,515 --> 00:04:59,300
Thanks.

69
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:01,476
Memory lane?

70
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,955
Yeah.

71
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:05,218
I mean, Dean couldn't have
been but 4 years old.

72
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:07,177
I wasn't even 6 months.
Just...

73
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,613
Hmm.

74
00:05:08,657 --> 00:05:10,659
You know, at one time,
you boys were good-lookin'.

75
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:13,226
Thanks.

76
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,402
Sam.

77
00:05:14,445 --> 00:05:17,535
What exactly happened to her?

78
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:20,321
Because I'm hearin' the kid...

79
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:24,977
- Hey.
- Hey.

80
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:27,371
You need anything?

81
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:29,417
Yeah, I need a drink.

82
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,635
Bar's open.

83
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:34,247
Nah, I need to get
outta here for a while.

84
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,294
But, dude, we got to
talk about Jack.

85
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,427
We will.

86
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:42,386
About that.

87
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,956
I liked the kid.
We fought together.

88
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:49,393
But there's only
one way this ends.

89
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:53,266
Bobby's right. We have to
find Jack and help him.

90
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,749
What? That kid...
He killed Mary!

91
00:05:57,793 --> 00:05:59,751
I know that.

92
00:05:59,795 --> 00:06:01,753
Ah-ah.
Don't say "but."

93
00:06:01,797 --> 00:06:04,277
But... he...

94
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:06,715
Jack may not even realize
what he did was wrong.

95
00:06:06,758 --> 00:06:11,415
If his human side is gone,
you know what's left... Lucifer.

96
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:13,983
Now, if you boys want to
sit around and talk, fine.

97
00:06:14,026 --> 00:06:15,941
But me?
I'm gonna get on the horn

98
00:06:15,985 --> 00:06:18,770
to some of my people
and go find that boy.

99
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:20,511
And what then?

100
00:06:23,688 --> 00:06:27,823
An unstoppable monster
who don't know right from wrong

101
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,302
gets put down...

102
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:31,435
Or the closest we can get to it.

103
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:35,526
And anybody who don't know that
needs to go back to school.

104
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:54,458
- Take me home, Jack.
- Tell me it's okay.

105
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:56,460
If Sam and Dean
saw what you did...

106
00:06:56,504 --> 00:06:59,332
they would be
as worried as I am.

107
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:01,726
Are you gonna tell them?

108
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,511
- Leave me alone!
- Please!

109
00:07:03,554 --> 00:07:06,557
- Listen! Jack?
- Leave me alone.

110
00:07:07,993 --> 00:07:09,778
- Listen to me!
- Leave me alone!

111
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:16,437
I wish you were here.

112
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,656
Mom...

113
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,138
I need you to tell me
what to do.

114
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:24,140
Well...

115
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:26,490
Next best thing.

116
00:07:26,534 --> 00:07:30,494
You're just in my head.
I'm making you up.

117
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:34,803
Or you see me because you know
I tell you the truth.

118
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:38,633
- No.
- Hmm.

119
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:42,854
And, by the way, buddy.
Um, I'm real.

120
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:44,682
You're part of my DNA.

121
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:48,077
I'm locked in your head
and your heart forever.

122
00:07:51,602 --> 00:07:53,517
- I'm not listening to you.
- So what are you gonna do?

123
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:56,607
You just gonna pine away for
Mommy and the Winchesters?

124
00:07:56,651 --> 00:08:00,393
Only they...
They never loved you.

125
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:01,917
You're nothing to them.

126
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,310
You're just their... You're
just a little pet monster.

127
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:05,573
Their... Their muscle.

128
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:08,227
No, they... They'll understand

129
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:11,709
about... what happened.

130
00:08:11,753 --> 00:08:13,711
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'll explain it to them.

131
00:08:13,755 --> 00:08:14,799
It... It was an accident.

132
00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:18,977
And I tried to
bring her back, and...

133
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:21,153
They've made mistakes, too.

134
00:08:22,546 --> 00:08:25,462
Okay. Dude...

135
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:27,769
They hate you.

136
00:08:27,812 --> 00:08:31,381
Okay? They don't even want you
for a pet anymore.

137
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:34,732
From here on out,
you're all you got.

138
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:39,737
Well, and me.

139
00:08:39,781 --> 00:08:41,870
Especially me.

140
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:33,918
Castiel.
What a pleasant surprise.

141
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:35,485
It's urgent that I see Naomi.

142
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:38,227
And, like I told you before,
she is unavailable.

143
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,229
What does that mean?
Just tell me.

144
00:09:40,272 --> 00:09:45,103
It means the Empty invaded.
Under her watch.

145
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:48,367
We almost died.
Under her watch.

146
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:50,239
Heaven needs a leader.

147
00:09:50,282 --> 00:09:51,675
A leader like you?

148
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:55,244
Oh, I'm not my first choice,
either, but here we are.

149
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:59,335
A-And Naomi, she's...?

150
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:01,555
In a very small cell.

151
00:10:01,598 --> 00:10:04,558
Not that you should care.
She wasn't your biggest fan.

152
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:06,429
No, but I needed her help.

153
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,256
With?

154
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:08,997
To find an archangel.

155
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,389
Really?

156
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:13,001
I mean, 'cause,
after Michael, there's...

157
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:14,306
There's none of those left.

158
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,266
This isn't exactly a...

159
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:18,833
It's the Nephilim.

160
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:20,574
Lucifer's love child.

161
00:10:20,617 --> 00:10:23,925
Jack has grown
massively powerful.

162
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:25,274
Dangerously so.

163
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:27,102
And I thought that
it was his "mother's side"

164
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:28,886
that was supposed to
give him self-control.

165
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,630
Well, in the sense that he
inherited her decency, yes.

166
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,241
But that was before.

167
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:37,852
Before what?

168
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:42,204
Before he burned through
his soul.

169
00:10:42,247 --> 00:10:45,512
To save me.
Among others.

170
00:10:46,948 --> 00:10:52,301
So he lost his capacity for good
through an act of goodness.

171
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,132
What about the Winchesters?

172
00:10:57,175 --> 00:10:59,308
Jack's no longer with them.

173
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:04,705
He's on the run.
He's fearful of their fury.

174
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,141
I bet he is.

175
00:11:06,184 --> 00:11:09,753
But I am hopeful
that he can be salvaged.

176
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:15,846
He can be rehabilitated, with
patient molding and guidance.

177
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,283
I'll see what I can do.

178
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,731
Hey.
You just getting back?

179
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,515
Yeah.

180
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,996
- How you feeling?
- What you working on?

181
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,781
I, uh...
I'm trying to find Jack.

182
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:39,653
We got to find him
before Bobby and his crew,

183
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:41,176
'cause if they find him first...

184
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:42,699
He's gonna kill 'em all?

185
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,222
I don't know.

186
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:49,750
You know, I can't stop
thinking about Mom.

187
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:53,405
Yeah.

188
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:56,583
I-I can't stop thinking that...

189
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:02,371
Most people, it's... it's...

190
00:12:02,414 --> 00:12:06,375
It's... it's hope
and faith, right?

191
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:11,554
That's all they have.
But we know the truth.

192
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,165
We know God is real.
We know angels are real, too.

193
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:18,213
God writes paperback books
in his underwear, okay?

194
00:12:18,256 --> 00:12:20,041
And angels are dicks.

195
00:12:20,084 --> 00:12:22,217
But they're real, right?

196
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,308
We know that Mom's not sitting
on a cloud playing a harp.

197
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:27,744
She's in a good place.

198
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,878
Or she's in a greatplace.
She's with Dad.

199
00:12:32,662 --> 00:12:34,098
Hmm.

200
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:37,058
You know what else?

201
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:40,409
There wasn't enough left of her
to even try to bring her back.

202
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:55,424
Hello, Jack.

203
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:57,992
Remember me?

204
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:01,256
We met... in Heaven.

205
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:03,171
Yes, we did.

206
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:04,607
How did you find me?

207
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,436
Jack, I came here
to tell you something.

208
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:10,787
Something important.

209
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:13,355
It wasn't your fault.

210
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:16,924
What happened
with Mary Winchester.

211
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:19,230
You know about that?

212
00:13:19,274 --> 00:13:22,190
Jack, it was a mistake.

213
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:25,323
That doesn't mean that you
don't deserve redemption.

214
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:27,238
I know...

215
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:29,327
Heaven knows...

216
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:34,811
your mother knew that you have
a gloriousdestiny.

217
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,160
I do?

218
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:41,862
Look at the world
around you, Jack.

219
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:45,517
You know, there was a time
when Earth had moral order.

220
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:48,303
When God would punish those
who did wrong

221
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:50,871
and who didn't respect Heaven.

222
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:57,007
But when he left,
it all fell apart.

223
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:58,487
You could change that.

224
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,359
You couldn't save
Mary Winchester, but...

225
00:14:01,403 --> 00:14:04,232
but you can save so many others,

226
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:07,496
even Heaven itself.

227
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:10,673
You could make the world
so much better.

228
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,201
And think how happy
that would make Sam and Dean.

229
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:38,875
Dr. Tate.

230
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,747
You've come about the leak
in my bathroom?

231
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,838
Hardly.

232
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,754
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

233
00:14:47,797 --> 00:14:52,889
Biblical Lies."

234
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,457
Quite the best seller,
I believe.

235
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,547
People are hungry for the truth.

236
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,245
And your call to
reject God and Heaven...

237
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,638
That is the "truth"?

238
00:15:02,681 --> 00:15:04,814
It's an attempt to replace
wishful thinking

239
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:06,685
with rational thought.

240
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:11,168
In more civilized times,
that was called heresy.

241
00:15:11,212 --> 00:15:14,519
And those ideas
were an affront to Heaven.

242
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:16,608
If there werea Heaven.

243
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:18,872
Oh, there is.
I've been there.

244
00:15:18,915 --> 00:15:23,093
I see.
And I suppose you saw God?

245
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:26,357
No.

246
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:27,924
But he is my grandfather.

247
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:32,233
Huh. So then that would
make your father...

248
00:15:32,276 --> 00:15:33,364
Lucifer.

249
00:15:35,062 --> 00:15:37,629
Professor Tate,
Heaven is not unreasonable.

250
00:15:37,673 --> 00:15:40,241
You can avoid divine
retribution by announcing

251
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:46,116
to your considerable audience
that you've had a revelation...

252
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,816
that everything you've
written to date is false...

253
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:51,339
that God is good.

254
00:15:51,382 --> 00:15:55,256
Yeah. You're insane. And I would
rather call security.

255
00:16:17,786 --> 00:16:20,266
So, the angels...
They're gonna help us?

256
00:16:20,461 --> 00:16:22,289
I was promised every effort

257
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,596
would be made
to, uh, locate Jack.

258
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,467
Oh. Heaven promised?
Great.

259
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:28,731
Well, we should take that
to the bank.

260
00:16:28,774 --> 00:16:31,908
Jack's powers
could also be a threat.

261
00:16:31,951 --> 00:16:34,258
It serves them to help find him.

262
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:35,607
Yeah, about that.

263
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,740
Um, I've been looking
for anything weird.

264
00:16:37,783 --> 00:16:41,091
And a university professor
was found dead

265
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:43,615
in his office in Ohio.

266
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:49,099
His body was crystallized
into a block of salt.

267
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:52,929
Salt. Why's that sound familiar?

268
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:57,542
It's a pillar of salt.
It's Biblical.

269
00:16:57,585 --> 00:17:00,501
Lot's wife.
Punished by Heaven.

270
00:17:00,545 --> 00:17:02,503
This guy was an atheist.

271
00:17:02,547 --> 00:17:04,114
He wrote a bunch
of best-selling books

272
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:07,073
trying to disprove
God and Heaven.

273
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:08,727
Okay. So you think
an angel iced him?

274
00:17:08,771 --> 00:17:11,034
No ordinary angel could do
something like that.

275
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:12,992
Just wait.
There's another.

276
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:14,820
A few hours after
the professor was killed,

277
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:19,172
a lady in Texas fell into
a crevice that opened up,

278
00:17:19,216 --> 00:17:20,652
and she was killed.

279
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:22,610
- Like a sinkhole.
- That's what I thought, too.

280
00:17:22,654 --> 00:17:24,003
But a witness said
it was more like

281
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:26,049
"a fissure opened under her feet

282
00:17:26,092 --> 00:17:28,355
then closed back up
with her inside."

283
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:32,272
"And the Earth opened her mouth
and swallowed them up,

284
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:33,970
and their houses,

285
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:36,624
and all of the men that
appertained unto Korah."

286
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:38,757
It's Numbers 26:10.

287
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:41,586
This lady was a...
A TV evangelist.

288
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:43,196
Um, she was under investigation

289
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,156
for stealing thousands of
dollars through fake charities.

290
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,767
So either Chuck
came back, which...

291
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:51,857
That ain't gonna happen, or...

292
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:52,945
Jack.

293
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:58,385
You've done
excellent work, Jack.

294
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:02,694
When God was in his prime,
Heaven was in its glory.

295
00:18:02,737 --> 00:18:05,392
Working as a team,
we can bring that back.

296
00:18:05,436 --> 00:18:07,003
Sam and Dean will like that?

297
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:10,484
Words can't begin to express
how Sam and Dean will feel.

298
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:12,138
Now...

299
00:18:12,182 --> 00:18:15,141
here is the real test.

300
00:18:15,185 --> 00:18:17,491
We need more angels.

301
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:21,974
You're not God. You can't just
make them out of thin air.

302
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:26,196
But if a human
were predisposed to it,

303
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,546
maybe you could take their soul

304
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:30,896
and forge them into one of us.

305
00:18:32,463 --> 00:18:34,291
What do you say?

306
00:18:41,646 --> 00:18:46,390
This is where your grandfather
received prayers.

307
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:53,092
Make yourself still.
And available.

308
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:55,442
Focus.

309
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:57,488
You'll hear.

310
00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:28,475
Dear God, please help...

311
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,304
Please, God, let the Giants
win the World Series.

312
00:19:31,348 --> 00:19:32,871
Please, God....

313
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:36,962
we beseech you
to hear our prayer.

314
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:40,661
We humbly ask that you receive

315
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:42,881
our gratitude for your gifts...

316
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:46,276
and pray that you deliver us
unto Heaven

317
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,017
and the greater glory.

318
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,279
Amen!

319
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:50,758
Amen!

320
00:19:50,802 --> 00:19:55,676
Okay. I sure hope everyone
did the reading last week.

321
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,635
- Uh-huh.
- Yes.

322
00:19:57,678 --> 00:20:00,768
Small surprise...
Pastor Ames is coming by

323
00:20:00,812 --> 00:20:03,554
to discuss the Book of Samuel.

324
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:10,169
Oh! Sorry.
I-I didn't see you come in.

325
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:12,389
Please. Join us.

326
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:15,218
Take a seat, mister...?

327
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:18,482
Jack.

328
00:20:18,525 --> 00:20:20,223
My name is Jack.

329
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:28,927
Did you mean it when you said
you wanted to go to Heaven?

330
00:20:28,971 --> 00:20:30,146
- Yes.
- Yes.

331
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:33,149
That's the goal of everyone
in this room.

332
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:34,367
Mm-hmm.

333
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:36,717
And you don't mind
becoming angels?

334
00:20:38,545 --> 00:20:40,373
Mind?

335
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:41,679
Yeah!

336
00:20:41,722 --> 00:20:43,246
That would be a dream.

337
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:46,727
It doesn't have to be a dream.

338
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,210
I-I'm not sure I understand.

339
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:12,231
Ohh!

340
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,584
Who are you?

341
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:20,326
Come with me.

342
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,937
To Heaven.

343
00:21:24,113 --> 00:21:26,767
So, who's ready to take
on the Book of Samuel?

344
00:21:26,811 --> 00:21:28,508
Hello.

345
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:32,338
I was just taking your friends...
to become angels.

346
00:21:32,382 --> 00:21:34,123
You... What?

347
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,689
Would you like to join them?

348
00:21:39,302 --> 00:21:44,481
Son. This isn't funny.
It's not even possible.

349
00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:48,746
So... you're saying
you don't believe?

350
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:51,531
It's not that I don't believe.

351
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:53,403
I just don't believe you.

352
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,318
And...

353
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,669
Shelley?

354
00:21:58,712 --> 00:22:01,454
Sir, please don't interfere
with Heaven's work.

355
00:22:01,498 --> 00:22:03,152
All right. Get out!

356
00:22:05,676 --> 00:22:10,811
"He was eaten by worms
and breathed his last."

357
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,577
Sir...

358
00:22:45,237 --> 00:22:47,457
Pastor Ames? Hi.

359
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,938
Agent Kilmister.
Clarke and Taylor. FBI.

360
00:22:50,982 --> 00:22:53,071
We want to ask you
about last night.

361
00:22:53,115 --> 00:22:54,725
What happened
to your congregation?

362
00:22:54,768 --> 00:22:57,641
You want to know w...

363
00:22:57,684 --> 00:23:00,426
They're all... They're gone.
They're all gone.

364
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:03,951
We're trying to figure out
exactly what happened.

365
00:23:03,995 --> 00:23:07,390
You're just
gonna think I'm crazy.

366
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:08,913
The cops did.

367
00:23:08,956 --> 00:23:13,570
About that, uh, the police
report stated that you said

368
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:15,876
the group "disappeared"
right in front of you.

369
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,095
Yeah.

370
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:18,488
Did he say where
he was taking them?

371
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:23,101
To Heaven.
To become angels.

372
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:28,150
Did he look anything like this?

373
00:23:30,413 --> 00:23:31,283
That's him.

374
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:34,417
I tried to stop him, but...

375
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,114
And he did all this to you?

376
00:23:36,158 --> 00:23:40,510
He just waved his hand,
and I landed on the floor,

377
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:44,601
and these cuts opened up
all over my body.

378
00:23:46,298 --> 00:23:48,779
And worms crawled out of 'em.

379
00:23:48,822 --> 00:23:49,954
Worms!

380
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:51,695
Worms.

381
00:23:51,738 --> 00:23:55,438
He said he was carrying out
Heaven's orders...

382
00:23:55,481 --> 00:23:58,180
and that I wasn't a believer.

383
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:04,316
- Well, feel better.
- Yeah.

384
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:15,632
"Immediately an angel of
the Lord struck him down,

385
00:24:15,675 --> 00:24:18,330
because he did not give God
the glory,

386
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:22,116
and he was eaten by worms
and breathed his last."

387
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,162
Wait. So this is
another Bible thing?

388
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:26,730
What the Hell is going on?

389
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,786
I didn't want it
to come to this, either.

390
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,571
But I know that that kid's
head's not right.

391
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:43,268
And now that Heaven
has its hooks in him,

392
00:24:43,312 --> 00:24:44,748
we don't have a choice.

393
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:46,967
Wait. Come to what?
What are you talking about?

394
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:48,752
Stopping Jack.
Once and for all.

395
00:24:48,795 --> 00:24:53,365
All right. Fine. Say I agree.
Dean, he can't be killed.

396
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,541
No, but he can be contained.

397
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,677
How are we supposed to do that?

398
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:12,254
With this.

399
00:25:12,297 --> 00:25:17,563
Are we seriously talking
about locking Jack in this?

400
00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:20,131
No, we're seriously talking
about not having a choice.

401
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:21,524
We can't kill him, okay?

402
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:25,223
And this is warded
to lock down an archangel.

403
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:27,312
Yeah. So... So, what?

404
00:25:27,356 --> 00:25:30,489
We... We just...
force him inside?

405
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:34,058
How? No. He goes in here,
it's got to be his choice.

406
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:35,973
He's never gonna
go along with that.

407
00:25:36,016 --> 00:25:38,541
Maybe.

408
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:41,021
But he might.

409
00:25:41,065 --> 00:25:43,546
He might if he only has to
stay in there long enough

410
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:47,550
for us to finish the spell
to fix his soul.

411
00:25:47,593 --> 00:25:50,074
Spell?

412
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:52,859
What spell?
There isno spell.

413
00:25:52,903 --> 00:25:56,254
Weknow that.

414
00:25:58,952 --> 00:26:01,868
So you want to lie to him.

415
00:26:01,912 --> 00:26:05,089
No. Well, I mean, I want
Zeppelin to get back together.

416
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:07,744
But what I need...
What weneed is to stop Jack.

417
00:26:07,787 --> 00:26:09,136
Big difference.

418
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,400
But here's the deal.
We both got to sign off on it.

419
00:26:11,443 --> 00:26:13,793
This might be our only shot,
and if he even catches a whiff

420
00:26:13,837 --> 00:26:16,056
that this is a scam,
he's off into the wind.

421
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,493
Exactly.

422
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:19,843
And how do you think he's not
gonna know something's up?

423
00:26:20,844 --> 00:26:23,716
Because you're gonna be
so damn sincere.

424
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,109
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

425
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,632
Why me?

426
00:26:26,676 --> 00:26:28,808
Because you've always been
in his corner, all right?

427
00:26:28,852 --> 00:26:30,419
You're his go-to guy.

428
00:26:30,462 --> 00:26:31,985
Sam, if you reach out,
he'll come.

429
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:35,685
If I do it, after what happened
to Mom, I could lose it.

430
00:26:37,904 --> 00:26:39,341
I will lose it.

431
00:27:01,443 --> 00:27:05,795
Eremiel, open the portal.

432
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,189
No can do, my brother.

433
00:27:08,232 --> 00:27:09,973
Heaven is now closed.

434
00:27:10,017 --> 00:27:12,106
No, it's not.
I was just there.

435
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:14,195
I'm sorry.
I said that wrong.

436
00:27:14,238 --> 00:27:17,894
Heaven is closed to you.

437
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:19,200
Orders.

438
00:27:19,243 --> 00:27:22,246
Eremiel.

439
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,423
I am going to Heaven.

440
00:27:24,466 --> 00:27:28,949
That's what everyone thinks.

441
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,185
Ohh!

442
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:49,491
It's working, Jack.

443
00:27:58,065 --> 00:27:59,936
Really, Eremiel?

444
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,461
Huh!

445
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:06,160
Castiel! Good news.

446
00:28:06,203 --> 00:28:07,857
I found Jack.

447
00:28:07,901 --> 00:28:11,208
Cass! Look!
I'm making angels.

448
00:28:11,252 --> 00:28:15,387
Yes, you, uh...

449
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,476
Dumah. A word?

450
00:28:20,653 --> 00:28:22,394
Now!

451
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:27,137
I-I don't think
this is gonna work.

452
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:28,922
One way to find out.

453
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:41,195
Jack.

454
00:28:41,238 --> 00:28:43,632
I hope you can hear this.

455
00:28:43,676 --> 00:28:45,199
I hope you can hear this.

456
00:28:45,242 --> 00:28:46,722
Some things...

457
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,681
Some things,
some bad things happened.

458
00:28:48,724 --> 00:28:51,466
But we're family.
We're your family.

459
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,469
A-And bad things
happen in families.

460
00:28:54,513 --> 00:28:56,210
...bad things happen
in families.

461
00:28:56,253 --> 00:28:57,559
But we, uh... We, uh...

462
00:28:57,603 --> 00:28:59,387
We want to talk with you.

463
00:28:59,431 --> 00:29:02,738
That's how we can all...
get through this.

464
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:06,438
That's how we can all
move forward.

465
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:10,050
I know what you're doing.

466
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:14,576
You're using Jack to
solidify your hold on Heaven.

467
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:19,320
Someone has loose lips.

468
00:29:23,106 --> 00:29:25,282
You're establishing
a reign of terror,

469
00:29:25,326 --> 00:29:29,112
beating humans into submission,
stripping Heaven of its mercy.

470
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:31,941
Oh, Heaven never really
had any mercy, Castiel.

471
00:29:31,985 --> 00:29:33,334
You know that.

472
00:29:33,377 --> 00:29:35,945
I am savingHeaven.

473
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:40,863
I am saving our kind.
I am saving the world.

474
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:44,650
Jack, we want...

475
00:29:44,693 --> 00:29:48,001
We needto see you.

476
00:29:48,044 --> 00:29:51,308
Our mother would want it.

477
00:29:51,352 --> 00:29:53,528
Yourmother would want it.

478
00:29:53,572 --> 00:29:55,661
Your mother would want it.

479
00:29:55,704 --> 00:30:00,579
I can't control Jack.
You've seen his strength.

480
00:30:00,622 --> 00:30:04,539
He's strong, yes,
but still a child

481
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:06,498
and without a soul to guide him.

482
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:08,848
I can guide him.

483
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:12,068
Jack, we just want things
to be the way they were.

484
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:14,331
We just want things
to be the way they were.

485
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:17,204
Are you hearing this? Are you hearing this?

486
00:30:17,247 --> 00:30:18,553
I am.

487
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:20,381
I'm getting Jack out of here.

488
00:30:20,424 --> 00:30:22,992
No... you're not.

489
00:30:23,036 --> 00:30:26,343
You really want
this fight, Dumah?

490
00:30:26,387 --> 00:30:29,564
Fight? I'm holding
the high cards here.

491
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:31,044
Ma and Pa Winchester,

492
00:30:31,087 --> 00:30:34,613
they're living in
their own personal Heaven.

493
00:30:34,656 --> 00:30:40,401
One snap of these fingers,
and all of that ends.

494
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:55,590
Jack? Jack!

495
00:31:01,204 --> 00:31:04,904
Guess he didn't hear.

496
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:10,518
I heard.
And I was so glad.

497
00:31:10,562 --> 00:31:14,174
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

498
00:31:15,784 --> 00:31:18,744
I've been working with the
angels to purify the world.

499
00:31:18,787 --> 00:31:22,661
Oh, and making angels.

500
00:31:22,704 --> 00:31:24,445
Yeah. I make angels.

501
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:28,667
But... I really
missed you guys.

502
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:33,367
Yeah. Us too.
Right, Sammy?

503
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,151
Tell Jack how, uh...

504
00:31:35,195 --> 00:31:38,502
How we want to clear things up,
you know, between us.

505
00:31:38,546 --> 00:31:42,071
I know... I know
things have been bad.

506
00:31:42,115 --> 00:31:45,945
A-And, if it helps, I regret it.

507
00:31:47,337 --> 00:31:49,209
The accident.

508
00:31:51,385 --> 00:31:53,648
The... The accident?

509
00:31:53,692 --> 00:31:55,345
What happened to Mary.

510
00:31:56,477 --> 00:32:00,655
She kept talking about my soul,
t-that I didn't have a soul,

511
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:02,091
and she kept pushing.

512
00:32:02,135 --> 00:32:05,486
Oh, so...
she madeyou do it.

513
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:09,490
No, it... it was me,
but I didn't want

514
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:14,626
this no-soul thing to
become an issue between us.

515
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:16,889
I guess I snapped.

516
00:32:21,894 --> 00:32:25,332
Before I knew it,
it was all over.

517
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:28,683
"It" being the "accident."

518
00:32:35,124 --> 00:32:38,475
I wish it didn't happen.

519
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:40,652
Yeah, Jack. So do we.

520
00:32:42,392 --> 00:32:43,742
But...

521
00:32:43,785 --> 00:32:46,832
w-we understand.

522
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:48,224
And we forgive you.

523
00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:52,751
You know, for the,
uh, "accident."

524
00:32:54,535 --> 00:32:56,972
That's what you want,
right, Jack?

525
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:00,976
I mean, you... you...
You'd like that?

526
00:33:02,412 --> 00:33:06,199
I'd like for things to
go back the way they were.

527
00:33:09,245 --> 00:33:10,899
I knew you'd understand.

528
00:33:12,684 --> 00:33:16,426
So if we told you
that we were close

529
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,907
to being able to fix your soul,

530
00:33:18,951 --> 00:33:23,520
we just need to keep you safe
until everything is ready,

531
00:33:23,564 --> 00:33:24,957
you... you'd be okay with that?

532
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,525
"Safe"?
What do you mean?

533
00:33:28,569 --> 00:33:31,790
Well, you could hurt
other people.

534
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:35,707
Have another, uh, accident.

535
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,927
Oh.

536
00:33:38,971 --> 00:33:43,410
We... We want to
keep you safe, Jack.

537
00:33:43,453 --> 00:33:48,241
That also means we... we have to
keep you safe from yourself.

538
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:52,071
You know,
just so nobody else gets hurt,

539
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:55,422
just until we get you better.

540
00:34:09,523 --> 00:34:11,351
Well, there she is.

541
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:14,789
It's actually
kind of comfortable.

542
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:17,661
Uh, and its best feature
is that it's warded,

543
00:34:17,705 --> 00:34:21,796
so it keeps your powers
below the meltdown level.

544
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,581
Yeah, so you
can't hurt anyone...

545
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:27,715
and n-nobody can hurt you.

546
00:34:30,457 --> 00:34:32,111
I understand.

547
00:34:36,332 --> 00:34:38,987
So, uh...

548
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:46,081
Okay.

549
00:34:54,698 --> 00:34:58,180
Um, do I just...

550
00:34:58,224 --> 00:34:59,442
Just hop on in.

551
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:20,420
Hm. Not bad.

552
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:22,204
Hey. Told ya.

553
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:27,079
How long before I can come out?

554
00:35:27,122 --> 00:35:31,344
Not too long.

555
00:35:34,129 --> 00:35:37,393
Jack, we got this.

556
00:35:47,882 --> 00:35:49,275
Okay.

557
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:31,242
Are you guys still there?

558
00:36:31,286 --> 00:36:32,330
Sam?!

559
00:36:32,374 --> 00:36:33,505
Dean?!

560
00:36:41,426 --> 00:36:42,906
Sam?

561
00:36:48,085 --> 00:36:50,653
Sam?

562
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:58,052
Dean? You still there?

563
00:37:03,623 --> 00:37:04,885
So what do we do now?

564
00:37:04,928 --> 00:37:10,934
Just... go on with Jack
locked up in there forever?

565
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:13,154
If we have to.

566
00:37:15,156 --> 00:37:17,245
I don't know if I can do that.

567
00:37:20,422 --> 00:37:23,947
I tell you what. This stuff
Ketch left, it's not bad.

568
00:37:32,608 --> 00:37:35,611
You know, I never thought it
would end like this with Jack.

569
00:37:35,655 --> 00:37:37,831
Sammy, we knew
from the beginning

570
00:37:37,874 --> 00:37:39,789
it was a long shot with him.

571
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:44,576
Yeah.

572
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,841
Yeah, but long shots
are kind of our thing.

573
00:37:53,629 --> 00:37:55,979
Guys?

574
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,808
I don't think I like this!

575
00:37:58,852 --> 00:38:00,767
Look at you, buddy.

576
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,814
Ahh.
You got played, man.

577
00:38:04,858 --> 00:38:08,296
Uh, I got to hand it
to the Winchesters.

578
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:09,645
They still got game.

579
00:38:09,689 --> 00:38:12,779
They... They said
I should trust them.

580
00:38:14,171 --> 00:38:15,825
And you believed that crap?

581
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:19,916
Buddy, buddy, trust
is a two-way street, man.

582
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,920
If they trusted you,
why did they lock you up?

583
00:38:23,964 --> 00:38:27,402
You, my friend, are screwed.

584
00:38:31,754 --> 00:38:35,627
Sam. Dean.
There's news.

585
00:38:35,671 --> 00:38:38,848
Dumah was manipulating Jack
into doing those things.

586
00:38:38,892 --> 00:38:41,198
She told him
it would please you.

587
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:43,070
Oh, so now it's ourfault?

588
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:46,290
I'm just saying it's urgent
that we find him and tell him.

589
00:38:46,334 --> 00:38:48,728
Cass, he's here.

590
00:38:49,685 --> 00:38:50,817
What?

591
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,385
He's locked up, safe.

592
00:38:54,429 --> 00:38:55,996
He's in the Ma'lak box.

593
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:57,780
No!

594
00:38:57,824 --> 00:39:00,087
And that's where
he's gonna stay.

595
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,006
Am I getting through to you?

596
00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:08,617
Did they tell you the specifics
of their "cure"?

597
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,662
Are you getting a new soul?

598
00:39:10,706 --> 00:39:13,100
Does it have a factory warranty?

599
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:15,972
Why didn't they tell you
how much time it would take?

600
00:39:17,757 --> 00:39:18,932
I don't know.

601
00:39:18,975 --> 00:39:21,282
You don't know
because you, my friend,

602
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:25,199
are naive, clueless, trusting.

603
00:39:25,242 --> 00:39:27,897
And you know what?
They suckered you.

604
00:39:27,941 --> 00:39:29,812
"Why," you may ask?
Okay.

605
00:39:29,856 --> 00:39:33,076
One, 'cause you're
no longer useful to them.

606
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,687
And, two, you killed
their mother.

607
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:38,168
Okay? There's no
coming back from that.

608
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:41,955
So thisis it,
for the rest of time.

609
00:39:57,013 --> 00:40:00,277
I'm sorry. Is that it?

610
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:04,238
You have to do way better
than that, buddy.

611
00:40:04,281 --> 00:40:06,109
Even after hearing what I said,

612
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:10,592
you want to keep Jack sealed
in a living death?

613
00:40:10,635 --> 00:40:12,855
He agreed to it.

614
00:40:12,899 --> 00:40:14,814
Because deep down,
I think he knows it's best.

615
00:40:14,857 --> 00:40:19,601
No. You're doing what Dumah...
You are manipulating him.

616
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,866
Bring it.

617
00:40:45,888 --> 00:40:47,107
Cass.

618
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,586
What? You just want
to forget about him?

619
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,372
I wish I could forget about him!
After what he did?

620
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:54,636
And you know what he can do.
This is our only play.

621
00:41:36,852 --> 00:41:38,158
Jack.
