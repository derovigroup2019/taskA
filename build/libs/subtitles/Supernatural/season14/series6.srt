1
00:00:02,951 --> 00:00:05,619
What just happened?

2
00:00:05,621 --> 00:00:07,254
This is the end...

3
00:00:07,256 --> 00:00:08,622
of everything.

4
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:14,594
We had a deal!

5
00:00:14,596 --> 00:00:16,129
Michael.

6
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:20,200
Thanks for the suit.

7
00:00:20,202 --> 00:00:22,135
I'm useless.

8
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:26,573
Charlie?

9
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:31,444
<i>She</i> wasn't cursed.

10
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:33,346
<i>This</i> was.

11
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:39,552
You have
the mind of a Hunter.

12
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:41,621
I don't remember most
of what Michael did.

13
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:42,656
No! Ugh!

14
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:44,624
And now
he's hurting people.

15
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:51,197
It's all on me.

16
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,166
It's my fault.

17
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,486
Good morning!

18
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,597
Whoa, whoa, Harper,
it's me.

19
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,865
Winston, God.

20
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:01,368
I'm sorry, I just, uh --
just wanted to make sure

21
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,738
that we're still on for,
you know, dinner tonight.

22
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,173
Um...

23
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:08,375
yeah, sure.

24
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,243
Harper.

25
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:12,412
Are you okay?
I heard a scream.

26
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:13,880
Is this guy
causing trouble?

27
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:16,850
"This guy"? Miles, we went
to high school together.

28
00:02:16,852 --> 00:02:19,372
Miles, we talked about you minding
your own business, didn't we?

29
00:02:20,856 --> 00:02:23,356
Put the stapler down.

30
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:28,728
I heard a scream.

31
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,836
Guy's always
been creepy.

32
00:02:36,838 --> 00:02:39,739
He's just overreacting because
nothing ever happens here.

33
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:42,509
Nobody comes
to the library anymore,

34
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:44,844
not even
for story time.

35
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:46,246
Isn't that sad?

36
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:49,549
Well,
I'm here.

37
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:51,184
I'll see you tonight.

38
00:02:51,186 --> 00:02:52,919
- For our date.
- For dinner.

39
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:55,555
Which I'm sure will be
a very nice time.

40
00:03:03,498 --> 00:03:04,898
Yes!

41
00:03:08,403 --> 00:03:11,404
? Well, you can tell
by the way I use my walk ?

42
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:12,739
? I'm a woman's man ?

43
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:14,307
? No time to talk ?

44
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:16,242
? Music loud and women warm ?

45
00:03:16,244 --> 00:03:18,478
? I've been kicked around
since I was born ?

46
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,114
? And now it's all right,
it's okay ?

47
00:03:21,116 --> 00:03:23,550
? And you may look
the other way ?

48
00:03:23,552 --> 00:03:25,251
? We can try -- ?

00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:46,973
Geez.

52
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:48,408
What's up
with the sugar?

53
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,177
Well, without my powers,
everything tastes different.

54
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:53,580
So, I can't get this
how I like it.

55
00:03:53,582 --> 00:03:54,747
Seen Sam?

56
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:56,249
He went to meet up
with Charlie.

57
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:58,785
You were on an overnight run
to Mary and Bobby's place.

58
00:03:58,787 --> 00:04:00,687
He said
it couldn't wait.

59
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:04,290
They're probably doing something
really exciting.

60
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:21,941
So, this is where
all those people went missing?

61
00:04:21,943 --> 00:04:24,677
Yep.

62
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:28,515
Right.

63
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:33,386
So, he just
left you here, huh?

64
00:04:33,388 --> 00:04:34,687
Yep.

65
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:37,423
Sam wanted someone around
when you came back.

66
00:04:38,894 --> 00:04:40,894
He's worried about you.

67
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:43,329
Yeah,
sounds like him.

68
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:47,033
Dean, what happened
with Michael --

69
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:49,135
no one blames you.

70
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:50,870
Cool.

71
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:53,673
Well, I blame me,
so...

72
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,548
Still with that cough,
huh?

73
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,385
Yeah, maybe I'm allergic
to sitting around doing nothing.

74
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:08,621
All right.

75
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:10,990
What do you want
to do?

76
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:12,458
Hunt.

77
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:14,827
Sam says
I can't go alone,

78
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:17,597
but Cass and I,
we've been working cases.

79
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:20,800
And he says you've been
doing good on those.

80
00:05:20,802 --> 00:05:22,135
No offense --

81
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:24,704
Cass is an insurance policy
on those hunts.

82
00:05:27,142 --> 00:05:30,376
Sam's just trying
to keep you safe, okay?

83
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:32,145
He's a smart guy.

84
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:39,919
Hmm.

85
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:45,925
Look.
Winston Mathers.

86
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:47,660
Dead,
with what appears to be

87
00:05:47,662 --> 00:05:49,629
human bite marks
taken out of the corpse.

88
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,997
"Human" bite marks?

89
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:54,200
And other people
have gone missing, too.

90
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,404
Well, Sam's not
gonna like it.

91
00:05:58,406 --> 00:06:00,373
Sam's not here.

92
00:06:01,443 --> 00:06:04,510
Okay, you know what?
You did good work. Okay?

93
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:06,246
- I'll go check it out.
- No.

94
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:08,615
We're supposed to have a partner
for all hunts now, right?

95
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:11,017
We can be
hunting buddies.

96
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:12,352
Okay. Uh...

97
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:14,454
"A" --
don't call it that.

98
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:17,123
And "B" --
you're gonna back me up?

99
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,492
Dean,
I need to do something.

100
00:06:19,494 --> 00:06:21,261
You don't understand.

101
00:06:22,197 --> 00:06:24,764
I could have
killed Michael.

102
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:28,234
Here,
when I was strong enough,

103
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:29,736
I could have.

104
00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:32,572
But there was
so much going on,

105
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:34,674
and then
everything else happened

106
00:06:34,676 --> 00:06:37,543
because I was distracted
and stupid and --

107
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:38,778
Hey.

108
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,647
You didn't
do anything wrong.

109
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:41,881
And neither did you.

110
00:06:41,883 --> 00:06:43,783
But that doesn't make it
any easier, does it?

111
00:06:43,785 --> 00:06:45,752
So, I can't just sit here
in the bunker

112
00:06:45,754 --> 00:06:47,053
thinking about it
all day.

113
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:48,388
What I could have
done differently,

114
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,056
how I can't do
anything about it now.

115
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:51,357
But I can do this.

116
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,159
I can hunt.

117
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:56,296
Give me a chance.

118
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,834
Are you sure?
Just you guys?

119
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:03,836
I mean, we can probably send
some other hunters out there.

120
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:05,605
It's so close and --

121
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:08,174
Yeah.
Be careful.

122
00:07:11,946 --> 00:07:15,248
Dean's going out on a hunt
with Jack.

123
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,584
Good for them.

124
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:22,355
Are you sure
this is the right place?

125
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:25,091
Well, it's where
those four people disappeared,

126
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:27,093
and when
I was scouting around,

127
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:29,028
I found this.

128
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:32,332
- What, goo?
- Goo.

129
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:35,168
So, yeah, I'd say
this is the right place.

130
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,469
Now I'm just trying
to figure out

131
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:37,904
what we're dealing with.

132
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:40,073
Thus, books.

133
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:48,715
? Ever since
she came to town... ?

134
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:52,852
This was Winston's
favorite spot?

135
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:54,253
His obituary said

136
00:07:54,255 --> 00:07:55,588
he loved having breakfast here
every morning,

137
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,757
which is sort of
oddly specific.

138
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,592
Yeah,
when a young guy dies,

139
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:01,928
they never know
what to put in those things.

140
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:05,198
Hi, there.

141
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,866
- Help you?
- Yeah.

142
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:08,868
Uh, Agent Berry,
FBI.

143
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,603
This is my partner,
Agent Charles.

144
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:12,372
Wondering if you can give
us some details

145
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:14,741
on a regular of yours,
Winston Mathers?

146
00:08:14,743 --> 00:08:16,042
Sure, hon.

147
00:08:16,044 --> 00:08:18,444
Um,
detail number one --

148
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:20,179
Winston's dead.

149
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:22,281
Detail number two --

150
00:08:22,283 --> 00:08:24,851
huh,
that's all the details.

151
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:27,887
Winston dead.

152
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:29,122
No details.

153
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:32,258
Uh, you know,
you're gonna want to be

154
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,826
a little more helpful
than that.

155
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:35,661
Listen,
Deep State.

156
00:08:35,663 --> 00:08:37,397
Flashing a badge
might work on people

157
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,665
who don't have a working
knowledge of the Constitution...

158
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,801
...but that ain't me.

159
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:44,203
Now I got to go
earn some money.

160
00:08:44,205 --> 00:08:47,306
Or you could stay here
and earn some money.

161
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,752
He, uh, came in every day
like clockwork.

162
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:04,123
But you <i>really</i> want to ask about
Harper Sayles.

163
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,925
Winston just started
courting her.

164
00:09:05,927 --> 00:09:07,260
What's "courting?"

165
00:09:07,262 --> 00:09:09,295
It's what you do
before you start dating.

166
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:11,931
Oh, and that's the thing you do
before the sex.

167
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:18,805
Sometimes you just
have the sex.

168
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:21,607
Okay, that's...

169
00:09:22,844 --> 00:09:25,111
Who is Harper Sayles?

170
00:09:25,113 --> 00:09:27,713
Harper's
a really sweet woman.

171
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:29,048
Everybody in town knows her.

172
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,316
It's been a sad life.

173
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:31,751
Prom queen in high school.

174
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:33,219
Very popular.

175
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:34,921
And her boyfriend
ran off on her.

176
00:09:34,923 --> 00:09:36,856
She did not take it well.

177
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:38,658
- Ever since then, well...
- Everything just seems to go wrong.

178
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,660
She's lost people --
Not people. Men.

179
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:41,994
- Men.
- Men.

180
00:09:41,996 --> 00:09:43,696
- A lawyer.
- A florist.

181
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:45,865
- A gym coach.
- Now Winston.

182
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:48,968
It just honestly seems like all
she cares about are her books.

183
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,736
Romance novels,
mostly.

184
00:09:50,738 --> 00:09:51,938
Heroes and damsels.

185
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,840
- Ask me?
- She's bad luck.

186
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:55,541
- She's bad luck.
- She's bad luck.

187
00:09:55,543 --> 00:09:57,243
- Real shame.
- Real shame.

188
00:10:04,953 --> 00:10:06,819
He'll be fine.

189
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:09,088
Your brother,
I mean.

190
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,023
He's got
other friends, right?

191
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:12,325
Funny.

192
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:15,394
Um, he used to have
a pretty damn good wing man.

193
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:18,865
So, call that guy
to check on him.

194
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:21,634
That "guy" was you.

195
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:25,304
No,
it wasn't.

196
00:10:25,306 --> 00:10:28,674
Right. I -- Sorry.
I didn't mean to...

197
00:10:28,676 --> 00:10:30,309
I'm just saying,

198
00:10:30,311 --> 00:10:33,179
I'm not surprised
you survived the apocalypse.

199
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:34,447
Yeah.

200
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:36,716
Well, <i>I</i> am.

201
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:40,686
Sam,
before all this,

202
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:44,023
I was just a programmer
at Richard Roman Enterprises.

203
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:46,859
I lived with
the love of my life, and we --

204
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:49,529
Wait, you -- you did?

205
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:51,731
Yeah.

206
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,501
So, your Charlie,
she --

207
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:01,774
I guess
she never met Kara.

208
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:04,243
Kara.

209
00:11:05,547 --> 00:11:06,746
Uh...

210
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:08,981
she owned a bakery
outside of Chicago.

211
00:11:08,983 --> 00:11:10,283
Cupcakes.

212
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:12,785
It was like something
out of a storybook.

213
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:15,321
She always
smelled like peaches,

214
00:11:15,323 --> 00:11:18,057
and her smile
was just...

215
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,201
Michael and Lucifer,
when they started their war,

216
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:32,872
first thing,
a giant EMP or something like it

217
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:34,907
went off
over North America.

218
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:37,043
Fried every bit
of technology.

219
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:40,212
Cellphones,
power plants.

220
00:11:40,214 --> 00:11:44,216
For the first few days,
we banded together.

221
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:48,554
Thought,
"Hey, someone'll save us".

222
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:50,990
No one ever did.

223
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:59,899
When the food ran out,
people got mean.

224
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:02,201
Mobs started forming,

225
00:12:02,203 --> 00:12:07,106
stealing whatever they could
get their hands on.

226
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:09,609
A lot of people died.

227
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,013
Kara died.

228
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:21,387
People are always the same
when things go wrong --

229
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:23,923
they lose it.

230
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:26,058
One day,
the water gets shut off,

231
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,296
the next day,
people are on fire.

232
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:36,168
It's a fact
about society --

233
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,238
it all falls apart.

234
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:53,419
Not here.

235
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:56,856
Not yet.

236
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:01,227
Well, congrats, Mighty Mouse.

237
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:02,795
I think
you found us a case.

238
00:13:02,797 --> 00:13:05,031
Thanks.
What's Mighty Mouse?

239
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:07,133
Eat up.

240
00:13:07,135 --> 00:13:08,734
Pie's important.

241
00:13:08,736 --> 00:13:10,603
Okay, uh,
can I ask you about

242
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:12,505
what Wanda said
about courting?

243
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:14,507
I mean,
I've seen romantic movies,

244
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:15,941
but I've never
experienced it.

245
00:13:15,943 --> 00:13:18,077
Unless what you said about
Rowena and Gabriel counts.

246
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,745
No,
definitely doesn't count.

247
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:21,781
Look, I promise
when we get back home,

248
00:13:21,783 --> 00:13:24,050
I'll give you
the talk, okay?

249
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:25,518
The talk?

250
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,886
Mm-hmm.

251
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:28,421
Right now what we got to find
is Harper Sayles.

252
00:13:28,423 --> 00:13:30,990
I mean, that's just too much
bad luck for one person.

253
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,362
Maybe --
Maybe she's not human.

254
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:38,597
Well, that's what
we're gonna find out.

255
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:40,700
How?

256
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:43,135
You ever read
a romance novel?

257
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:51,577
Harper Sayles?

258
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:54,146
Hi!
Um, how can I help you?

259
00:13:54,148 --> 00:13:55,715
Uh, FBI.

260
00:13:55,717 --> 00:13:59,852
Got some questions
about Winston Mathers.

261
00:13:59,854 --> 00:14:02,421
Oh, I already spoke
to the police.

262
00:14:02,423 --> 00:14:04,256
Well,
I'm not the police.

263
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:05,858
I don't -- I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

264
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,593
Well, I'm gonna <i>need</i> you
to talk about it.

265
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:11,530
Hello.

266
00:14:11,532 --> 00:14:13,733
Sorry to interrupt.

267
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:16,135
I'm looking for the best book
on the area's history.

268
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:18,304
Excuse me.
<i>I</i> was talking with her.

269
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:19,605
Really?

270
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:21,741
Because it doesn't look like
she wants to talk to you.

271
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:27,079
- Listen, I'm, uh --
- FBI.

272
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:28,280
Yeah,
I heard.

273
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:29,882
But, see,
I haven't done anything wrong,

274
00:14:29,884 --> 00:14:31,350
so you can't
do anything to me.

275
00:14:31,352 --> 00:14:33,285
And if she doesn't want
to talk to you,

276
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:34,587
you can't make her.

277
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:36,589
Not without
arresting her.

278
00:14:36,591 --> 00:14:37,757
But you're FBI,

279
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,191
so you probably
knew that already.

280
00:14:39,193 --> 00:14:40,893
Okay.

281
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,963
Why don't you back off,
kid?

282
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:45,664
No,
you back off...

283
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,932
old man.

284
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:48,701
Uh --

285
00:14:50,371 --> 00:14:52,238
Old man?

286
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,174
Yeah.
That's right.

287
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:02,114
Okay.
All right.

288
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:04,383
This isn't over.

289
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:10,689
That was
so chivalrous.

290
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:11,791
Yeah.

291
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:13,959
What's his problem?

292
00:15:13,961 --> 00:15:16,695
He was just asking --

293
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:20,299
Y-You know what?
It's fine, I'm fine.

294
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:22,101
Thank you
for stepping in.

295
00:15:22,103 --> 00:15:23,536
You didn't
have to do that.

296
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:25,404
I'm Jack,
by the way.

297
00:15:25,406 --> 00:15:27,473
Jack Smith.

298
00:15:27,475 --> 00:15:29,008
Harper.

299
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:33,612
I have
the perfect book for you.

300
00:15:33,614 --> 00:15:35,181
That would be great.

301
00:15:39,587 --> 00:15:42,288
Old man, my ass.

302
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:47,960
Harper.

303
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:49,662
Are you leaving?

304
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:51,564
Miles,
this is Jack.

305
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:53,566
He's visiting, and I'm getting
him my favorite book about town.

306
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:54,800
It's just
down at my apartment,

307
00:15:54,802 --> 00:15:56,135
but, um, I'll come back
and lock up.

308
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:58,204
You're taking him
to your apartment?

309
00:15:58,206 --> 00:15:59,605
You don't even
know this guy.

310
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:02,241
Miles, stop it.
Let's go.

311
00:16:06,714 --> 00:16:10,416
All right,
where are we headed?

312
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:04,267
How many books
are you reading?

313
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:05,669
All of them.

314
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:08,271
I hate hunting.

315
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:09,673
Really?

316
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:10,907
'Cause I got to say,

317
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:12,575
you're kind of awesome
at it.

318
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:15,578
Yeah, well, when it's that
or die by angel kill squad...

319
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,846
Right.

320
00:17:16,848 --> 00:17:18,048
I mean,
no offense,

321
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,549
but who wants
to be a hunter?

322
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:23,420
This job, it's just
a lot of tears and death.

323
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:25,722
Funny.

324
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:28,658
You, uh -- You said
something like that to me once

325
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,827
long ago about hunting.
Not you.

326
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:32,696
Uh, sorry.

327
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:34,464
Our Charlie.

328
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:36,966
Well,
she was right.

329
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:39,803
So glad
this is my last case.

330
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,071
What?

331
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:43,773
I told myself I'd help you out
for awhile,

332
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:46,042
at least until everyone
got really settled,

333
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:48,278
and then...
- I'm out.

334
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,081
- To do what? To go where?
- Away.

335
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:55,418
From monsters,
from people, from...

336
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,987
I'll go live on a mountaintop
or something.

337
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:00,156
As long
as there's good Wi-Fi.

338
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:10,767
Come in.

339
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:17,407
Okay,
I'm just realizing

340
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:19,909
it's weird
I brought you to my place.

341
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:21,611
That's weird.
I'm weird.

342
00:18:21,613 --> 00:18:23,847
It's fine.
I think.

343
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:26,383
You need to get
that book, right?

344
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:28,251
I just don't want you
to think I'm --

345
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:30,520
I'm not putting
the moves on you.

346
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:34,791
- The moves?
- I'll go get the book.

347
00:18:39,564 --> 00:18:41,931
Hey, uh,
do you mind --

348
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:45,034
Is it okay
to ask you about the guy

349
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:46,603
who was hassling you
at the library?

350
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:49,239
Oh, recently,
a boy I knew --

351
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:52,108
or was starting to know --
passed away.

352
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,777
It was terrible.

353
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:55,879
The authorities have been asking
a lot of questions,

354
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:57,380
but I don't
know anything,

355
00:18:57,382 --> 00:18:59,482
and I'm a pretty private person,
so...

356
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:02,519
It's been
a little difficult.

357
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:05,722
- That's awful about your friend.
- Thanks.

358
00:19:07,926 --> 00:19:09,392
Is this yours?

359
00:19:09,394 --> 00:19:13,563
Oh, sorry.
I must've dropped that.

360
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,433
Your hand is wet.

361
00:19:17,836 --> 00:19:19,335
<i>Christo.</i>

362
00:19:19,337 --> 00:19:22,338
Did you say something?

363
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,606
Uh, no.

364
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:24,974
Uh...

365
00:19:24,976 --> 00:19:27,010
I'm just nervous.

366
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:29,712
Come here.

367
00:19:34,486 --> 00:19:36,386
Got something.

368
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:37,487
What?

369
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:39,022
Have you ever
heard of a Musca?

370
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:41,157
Yeah, like a hybrid
between a man and a fly.

371
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:42,592
A lot of stories
about them,

372
00:19:42,594 --> 00:19:44,360
but no one's ever seen one
in real life.

373
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:46,329
If they do exist,
they keep to themselves.

374
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:47,897
Look at you.

375
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:49,866
Oh, I have read
all the books.

376
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:53,002
Nerd.
But check this.

377
00:19:53,004 --> 00:19:56,105
Every few hundred years,
there's a "bad egg".

378
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:57,874
When a male
fails to find a mate,

379
00:19:57,876 --> 00:20:00,143
he abandons
his community

380
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:02,512
and starts using people's bodies
to nest,

381
00:20:02,514 --> 00:20:06,115
binding them together
with a viscous goo.

382
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:09,853
- And when the goo fits...
- Oh, great.

383
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:14,090
Our perp might just be a giant
fly with low self-esteem.

384
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:17,560
- Sam.
- Yeah?

385
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:19,062
What is that?

386
00:20:43,822 --> 00:20:47,257
So,
where are you from?

387
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:51,961
I'm from a little town in Kansas
called Lebanon.

388
00:20:51,963 --> 00:20:54,664
It's actually smaller
than this one.

389
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,965
Wow.

390
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:58,234
Yeah, my family's been here
for generations.

391
00:20:58,236 --> 00:20:59,702
I'm the last one.

392
00:21:02,974 --> 00:21:05,575
Are you okay?

393
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:11,080
Is this --
Is this your boyfriend?

394
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:14,918
I'm single.

395
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,185
Perpetually.

396
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:18,555
But Vance
was my boyfriend.

397
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:21,357
After high school,
he wanted to leave town.

398
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,359
I told him
we didn't need to.

399
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:25,328
We could see the world
in books.

400
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:29,699
Which I know
sounds way too sappy.

401
00:21:29,701 --> 00:21:33,202
And...
he left anyway.

402
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:35,572
Without <i>you?</i>

403
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:43,279
I don't blame him.

404
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:46,015
But that, well...

405
00:21:46,017 --> 00:21:49,819
that was the beginning
of my bad luck.

406
00:21:49,821 --> 00:21:53,289
Just so many things
that I --

407
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:57,660
I try
to stay optimistic.

408
00:21:57,662 --> 00:21:59,128
Me, too.

409
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,397
I've had some...

410
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:06,402
not-so-great stuff
happen in my past.

411
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,974
Trying to be positive...

412
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:13,142
it can be hard.

413
00:22:24,856 --> 00:22:27,023
Jack?

414
00:22:29,427 --> 00:22:33,563
Do you believe
in love at first sight?

415
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:36,799
Do you...

416
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:41,403
...mind if I use
the bathroom?

417
00:22:50,512 --> 00:22:51,978
Jack.

418
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,146
Uh, Dean?

419
00:22:53,148 --> 00:22:55,615
Um,
I'm at Harper's place.

420
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:57,951
The silver and the holy water
didn't do anything,

421
00:22:57,953 --> 00:22:59,419
so she's not
a demon.

422
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:00,787
Where are you?

423
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:03,250
Because Harper is not
a monster,

424
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:05,385
and I'm 99% sure
she's in love with me.

425
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:06,919
That's not
how it works, kid.

426
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:09,856
Okay, but she was looking at me
with these googly eyes,

427
00:23:09,858 --> 00:23:11,257
and then
she asked me --

428
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,792
Look, I promise you
that Harper Sayles

429
00:23:12,794 --> 00:23:14,627
is not in love with you, okay?
Would you calm down?

430
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:15,995
Okay.

431
00:23:15,997 --> 00:23:18,297
But if she is, I need to know
everything about sex. Go.

432
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,532
Jack,
listen to me.

433
00:23:19,534 --> 00:23:21,501
The guy that she works with
is dead,

434
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:23,469
and I mean
fresh dead.

435
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:25,138
Something bit out
his throat.

436
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,373
So, we got bigger things
to worry about right now.

437
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,708
Okay,
what should I do?

438
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,376
Well, something's definitely
stalking Harper,

439
00:23:30,378 --> 00:23:31,944
or at least the people
around her.

440
00:23:31,946 --> 00:23:35,448
She said that she had bad luck.
Maybe she's cursed.

441
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,984
Well, seems like
the guys around her are cursed.

442
00:23:37,986 --> 00:23:40,520
Okay,
guys like me?

443
00:23:40,522 --> 00:23:42,422
Yeah.
Look, just keep her there --

444
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:46,526
Dean?

445
00:23:46,528 --> 00:23:47,960
Dean?

446
00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:58,304
- Are you upset?
- What?

447
00:23:58,306 --> 00:23:59,872
Ugh, I freaked you out,
didn't I?

448
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:02,408
I'm sorry. Sometimes I can
come off as intense.

449
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,211
No, you're fine.

450
00:24:05,213 --> 00:24:07,346
<i>I'm</i> fine.

451
00:24:07,348 --> 00:24:08,481
So...

452
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:11,951
do you want to go get coffee,
or...?

453
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:13,319
I don't know.

454
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:15,121
You don't know?

455
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:20,660
No, no, no, it's okay. It's okay.

456
00:24:20,662 --> 00:24:22,862
We're here to help you.

457
00:24:22,864 --> 00:24:24,130
I'm Dean,
okay?

458
00:24:24,132 --> 00:24:26,265
I work with Jack.
We're not FBI.

459
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:28,634
We're here to save lives --
maybe even yours.

460
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:30,069
Save me?
From what?

461
00:24:30,071 --> 00:24:32,572
That.

462
00:24:39,432 --> 00:24:41,533
- Who's out there?
- It's not a "who".

463
00:24:41,535 --> 00:24:43,268
At first,
I thought it was a ghost,

464
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,837
but then it punched me in the face.
- A ghost?

465
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:47,139
No, he's saying
it's <i>not</i> a ghost.

466
00:24:48,843 --> 00:24:50,809
Yeah, now I'm thinking,
uh --

467
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:52,878
- Who is this?
- That's my old boyfriend Vance.

468
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,114
- How did he die?
- Die? I think he lives in Connecticut.

469
00:24:56,116 --> 00:24:58,250
- Not anymore.
- Harper!

470
00:24:58,252 --> 00:25:00,552
Vance?!
- Vance?

471
00:25:00,554 --> 00:25:01,854
Vance.

472
00:25:01,856 --> 00:25:03,622
All right, so we're dealing with
some sort of undead,

473
00:25:03,624 --> 00:25:06,191
risen dead --
something in that wheelhouse.

474
00:25:06,193 --> 00:25:07,726
Harper!
Silver. Silver.

475
00:25:07,728 --> 00:25:09,228
Risen dead?

476
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,230
- Yeah.
- Harper!

477
00:25:11,232 --> 00:25:13,432
Looks like you
finally get your zombie, kid.

478
00:25:13,434 --> 00:25:15,701
- Zombie?!
- Oh, he means --

479
00:25:15,703 --> 00:25:17,269
Silver can hurt it,
maybe slow it down,

480
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:21,173
but there is only one way
to stop these things.

481
00:25:31,318 --> 00:25:33,318
- Jack, get her out of here.
- I-I can't just leave.

482
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,987
Go, now!

483
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:41,360
Archie! Hey!

484
00:25:41,362 --> 00:25:43,161
Let's dance.

485
00:26:01,682 --> 00:26:02,915
Charlie,
you can't just quit

486
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:04,349
and go live on
a mountain somewhere.

487
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:09,421
- People need people.
- Why?

488
00:26:09,423 --> 00:26:10,889
'Cause they're the luckiest
people in the world?

489
00:26:10,891 --> 00:26:12,024
No, come on.

490
00:26:12,026 --> 00:26:14,192
We just do.
We're social animals.

491
00:26:14,194 --> 00:26:16,795
- Emphasis on "animals".
- Yeah, but you're also a hunter.

492
00:26:16,797 --> 00:26:18,430
The things
that we've seen,

493
00:26:18,432 --> 00:26:20,432
it's not so easy
to just walk away from it all.

494
00:26:20,434 --> 00:26:22,834
Believe me, I've tried.
<i>Our</i> Charlie tried.

495
00:26:22,836 --> 00:26:25,370
Yeah, well, again,
she ain't me.

496
00:26:27,274 --> 00:26:28,907
It's <i>my</i> life,
Sam.

497
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:31,176
Not <i>hers</i>
and not <i>yours.</i>

498
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,447
He's back.

499
00:26:37,918 --> 00:26:40,452
That's got to be
our guy, right?

500
00:26:40,454 --> 00:26:41,553
- I say we rush him.
- No, no, no.

501
00:26:41,555 --> 00:26:42,955
Wait for it.
Wait for it.

502
00:26:42,957 --> 00:26:44,456
We don't want to run up
and tackle some regular guy

503
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:45,991
just 'cause he's into
weird fashion.

504
00:26:45,993 --> 00:26:47,526
Mm, don't we?

505
00:26:53,367 --> 00:26:56,802
Come on.

506
00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:08,814
Damn it!
Go, go, go, go!

507
00:27:11,385 --> 00:27:13,285
Wait!
W-What is happening?

508
00:27:13,287 --> 00:27:16,922
No, look -- Look, we have to
keep moving.

509
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:28,900
Hyah!

510
00:27:33,874 --> 00:27:35,774
What the hell?

511
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,984
You were gonna come back
and lock up, remember?

512
00:27:45,986 --> 00:27:48,086
No. Apparently,
my dead high-school boyfriend

513
00:27:48,088 --> 00:27:49,821
attacked us,
and I forgot.

514
00:28:01,735 --> 00:28:04,302
Where'd they go?

515
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:08,707
Not a lot of options.

516
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:09,841
Look at this.

517
00:28:09,843 --> 00:28:11,877
I cased
this block earlier.

518
00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:13,178
That was
definitely locked...

519
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,147
and, you know,
not covered in goo.

520
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:17,916
You said there was something
in the book about, uh, uh,

521
00:28:17,918 --> 00:28:20,318
a brass nail dipped
in sugar water can kill it?

522
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,422
In theory, since no one's
actually seen one.

523
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:26,625
And we have exactly zero
of those items handy, so...

524
00:28:26,627 --> 00:28:28,627
So,
we get creative.

525
00:28:38,005 --> 00:28:41,440
Ugh.

526
00:28:41,442 --> 00:28:43,575
Oh, God.
That is, uh...

527
00:28:43,577 --> 00:28:46,945
Yeah, smells like pine cleaner
and rotting meat.

528
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,583
Sam?

529
00:30:00,487 --> 00:30:03,855
Yeah, he was chloroformed,
all right.

530
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:07,893
I found him.

531
00:30:09,897 --> 00:30:12,164
He's still alive.

532
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:14,332
We should
get him out of here.

533
00:30:16,203 --> 00:30:19,171
- Charlie?
- Sam!

534
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,080
Charlie!

535
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,687
Hey, hey, Charlie.

536
00:30:35,689 --> 00:30:37,889
Charlie!

537
00:31:09,656 --> 00:31:14,359
So...
we got creative.

538
00:31:14,361 --> 00:31:17,162
Cool.

539
00:31:25,197 --> 00:31:27,264
Don't worry.

540
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:28,532
I locked it.

541
00:31:28,534 --> 00:31:30,300
Did you flip the switch
under the lock?

542
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:32,269
What -- What switch?

543
00:31:32,271 --> 00:31:33,503
I'll get it.

544
00:31:33,505 --> 00:31:35,839
Harper, don't!
Don't!

545
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:02,632
Harper?

546
00:32:04,103 --> 00:32:06,269
Aww, sweet.

547
00:32:07,973 --> 00:32:11,675
No, no.

548
00:32:11,677 --> 00:32:13,643
What are you doing?

549
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:17,080
What?
He's my boyfriend.

550
00:32:17,082 --> 00:32:20,217
He just gets
a little jealous sometimes.

551
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:21,818
But he's dead.

552
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,553
And stalking you.

553
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:25,021
No,
he's stalking <i>you.</i>

554
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:27,157
It's a little game
we play.

555
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:28,925
Some people
pretend to be naughty nurses,

556
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:31,061
some people get tied up.
We do this.

557
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:33,964
Oh, and he has to eat flesh
to maintain his body.

558
00:32:33,966 --> 00:32:36,466
Stupid magic.

559
00:32:36,468 --> 00:32:38,602
But it all
works out.

560
00:32:38,604 --> 00:32:40,137
Except...

561
00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:42,005
not for you.

562
00:32:57,389 --> 00:32:59,022
I'm sorry about all this,
Jack.

563
00:32:59,024 --> 00:33:00,327
<i>I actually think I liked you.</i>

564
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:02,228
<i>But you're obviously a hunter,</i>

565
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,697
<i>and I come from a long line</i>
<i>of necromancers.</i>

566
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:07,433
I mean, I can mostly
only raise the dead,

567
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:08,834
but that comes in handy.

568
00:33:08,836 --> 00:33:10,903
And I can't let you
or your friend

569
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:14,307
get in the way
of the love Vance and I share.

570
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:16,275
<i>It's first love, Jack.</i>

571
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:17,643
<i>The best kind.</i>

572
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:20,046
<i>Without baggage or compromise.</i>

573
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:23,716
I mean, I did have to kill him
to keep him here after college,

574
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:26,485
<i>but...every relationship</i>
<i>has its stuff, right?</i>

575
00:33:26,487 --> 00:33:29,755
<i>And all the other guys --</i>
<i>none of them are like Vance.</i>

576
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,892
<i>Strong and courageous and --</i>

577
00:33:32,894 --> 00:33:35,194
<i>So, they all had to die.</i>

578
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:38,097
Especially Miles,
who just -- ugh.

579
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,067
<i>So, I had Vance</i>
<i>crush his throat.</i>

580
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:43,869
I wish I could have watched.

581
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,106
<i>And now</i>
<i>we're going to kill</i> you.

582
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:15,334
Shh.

583
00:34:15,336 --> 00:34:16,435
Okay.

584
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:18,104
Not a lot works
on these things.

585
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:20,840
Uh, headshot?

586
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:22,241
No, no, no.

587
00:34:22,243 --> 00:34:24,110
Creeps like this, you got to
get 'em back in their grave.

588
00:34:24,112 --> 00:34:25,066
Drive a silver stake through
their heart to keep 'em there.

589
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,446
Okay, so...?

590
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:29,348
So, we got to convince this guy
to get six feet under.

591
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:33,152
And you're gonna convince him
with your shotgun?

592
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,787
Not exactly.

593
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:38,557
Harper?

594
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,726
Why are you
doing this?

595
00:34:40,728 --> 00:34:44,597
I-I thought we fell in love
at first sight.

596
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,831
What?

597
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,701
I'm not weak
like those other guys.

598
00:34:48,703 --> 00:34:52,304
I'm not afraid
to really love you.

599
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:55,708
What would it be like to be
with someone alive?

600
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,078
Who could walk you
down the aisle

601
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,446
in front
of the whole town?

602
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:02,982
And start
a family with.

603
00:35:02,984 --> 00:35:04,617
With me.

604
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,318
But I tried
to kill you.

605
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,955
Every relationship
has its stuff, right?

606
00:35:09,957 --> 00:35:13,793
We can stay
in the town you love

607
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:15,428
a-and never leave.

608
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:20,232
She's mine!

609
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:25,337
Hey!

610
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:27,139
No!

611
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:33,379
Hey, okay, look, I'm sure
you were in love, okay?

612
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,748
But this isn't love,
not anymore.

613
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,483
I love her.

614
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:39,518
Yes, sure, sure,
but now it's like

615
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
some sort of a sick game,
you know?

616
00:35:41,522 --> 00:35:44,323
I mean, you have to eat people
to stay together?

617
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:45,791
I mean,
is that romantic?

618
00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:47,493
Huh?
You enjoy that?

619
00:35:49,263 --> 00:35:50,596
Okay,
all right.

620
00:35:50,598 --> 00:35:52,732
Look, let's just think
about this for a second.

621
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:57,103
Vance!

622
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:02,675
Baby, kill him!

623
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:09,115
Vance!

624
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,389
You okay?

625
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:20,259
Yeah.
Just grab the girl.

626
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:26,098
Oh,
son of a bitch.

627
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:35,490
You know, I think that guy
from the bus stop --

628
00:36:35,492 --> 00:36:36,925
I think
he'll be all right.

629
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:38,459
I bet they'll take good care
of him at the hospital.

630
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:41,162
He's also gonna wake up
with a serious headache.

631
00:36:41,164 --> 00:36:43,398
Better than
being killed.

632
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,166
Hmm.

633
00:36:45,168 --> 00:36:48,870
Got to say, I do feel
kind of bad for the Musca.

634
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:52,473
I-I mean,
he could have been happy

635
00:36:52,475 --> 00:36:53,908
if it stayed
with his people.

636
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,910
Didn't have to go off on its own
just because --

637
00:36:55,912 --> 00:36:57,312
Okay,
I get it.

638
00:36:57,314 --> 00:36:58,613
I am
just like the bug,

639
00:36:58,615 --> 00:37:00,815
and I shouldn't
go out on my own.

640
00:37:00,817 --> 00:37:03,451
But your nifty metaphor
has holes.

641
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:10,692
I wasn't looking
for love.

642
00:37:10,694 --> 00:37:13,394
I found it,
and I lost it.

643
00:37:13,396 --> 00:37:15,430
And I didn't kill people

644
00:37:15,432 --> 00:37:18,099
and literally nest
in their body parts, so...

645
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:20,535
Okay,
I know, I know.

646
00:37:20,537 --> 00:37:22,136
How about this?

647
00:37:22,138 --> 00:37:23,471
Don't leave.

648
00:37:23,473 --> 00:37:26,174
Hear me out.

649
00:37:26,176 --> 00:37:28,042
Sure, some people
can do bad things

650
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:29,777
when they're desperate
or scared,

651
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:31,880
but I mean,
the guy we just saved,

652
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,249
he has a wife,
children.

653
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:38,119
I'm not saying all people
are good people

654
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:40,755
or even that most people are,
but...

655
00:37:40,757 --> 00:37:42,824
if we help people,

656
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:46,761
then maybe <i>they'll</i> help people
and all that.

657
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:48,529
And that's worth it.

658
00:37:48,531 --> 00:37:51,232
Even with all the tears
and death --

659
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:53,835
it's worth it.

660
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:05,413
Just to be
super clear,

661
00:38:05,415 --> 00:38:06,781
I am not like
the fly monster.

662
00:38:08,084 --> 00:38:11,352
But...

663
00:38:11,354 --> 00:38:14,923
I'll think
about staying.

664
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:20,361
? We're traveling down
two different roads ?

665
00:38:20,363 --> 00:38:23,264
? In worlds so far apart ?

666
00:38:23,266 --> 00:38:26,868
? You want me,
yet there's something else ?

667
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,270
? Before me in your heart ?
Harper: <i>"Jack.</i>

668
00:38:29,272 --> 00:38:32,807
<i>I'm already writing --</i>
<i>isn't that crazy?</i>

669
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:34,175
<i>I'm not crazy.</i>

670
00:38:34,177 --> 00:38:36,377
<i>But our love is so vivid.</i>

671
00:38:36,379 --> 00:38:38,246
<i>I can't wait to find you.</i>

672
00:38:38,248 --> 00:38:43,017
<i>You're the first man to ever</i>
<i>get me to leave McCook.</i>

673
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:44,819
<i>Now I'm in the world.</i>

674
00:38:44,821 --> 00:38:48,089
<i>I'm sorry I have to kill you</i>
<i>for what you did to Vance,</i>

675
00:38:48,091 --> 00:38:49,490
<i>but then I can bring you back</i>

676
00:38:49,492 --> 00:38:51,459
<i>so that we can be together</i>
<i>again.</i>

677
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:55,063
<i>It's gonna be...perfect.</i>

678
00:38:55,065 --> 00:38:57,365
<i>See you soon.</i>

679
00:38:57,367 --> 00:39:00,234
<i>Love, Harper".</i>

680
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:03,938
? If we can't live together,
then it's best we live apart ?

681
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:08,543
? You'll go your way
and I'll go mine ?

682
00:39:08,545 --> 00:39:11,679
? We'll both make
a brand-new start ?

683
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:21,055
So, now that Vance
is in the grave,

684
00:39:21,057 --> 00:39:23,291
he can't hurt anyone?

685
00:39:23,293 --> 00:39:25,893
Yeah.

686
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:27,695
Silver stake
through the heart --

687
00:39:27,697 --> 00:39:29,364
that ought
to do the trick.

688
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:33,234
And...that's love?

689
00:39:33,236 --> 00:39:34,602
Eh.

690
00:39:34,604 --> 00:39:37,005
Actually, love can get
crazier than that.

691
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,573
And it might
get crazier,

692
00:39:38,575 --> 00:39:40,908
with Harper still out there,
but, uh...

693
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:44,045
You did good,
kid.

694
00:39:45,148 --> 00:39:46,881
And?

695
00:39:46,883 --> 00:39:48,516
And what?

696
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:49,751
I was right,

697
00:39:49,753 --> 00:39:51,986
and you should be letting me
go out on hunts.

698
00:39:51,988 --> 00:39:54,088
Okay.
All right.

699
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:58,793
Look, it's not about
being right, okay?

700
00:39:58,795 --> 00:40:00,828
You're gonna make mistakes.

701
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,765
Hell, I make them
all the time.

702
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:05,233
But it's how
you handle yourself

703
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:07,135
once you've made
those mistakes.

704
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:08,770
And you learn
from them.

705
00:40:08,772 --> 00:40:10,605
And...

706
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:13,274
how to not beat yourself up
over them?

707
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:21,682
You know, Jack,
you're pretty smart sometimes.

708
00:40:23,787 --> 00:40:26,187
I tell you what --
when Sam gets back,

709
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:28,856
I'll talk to him about
getting you out on more hunts.

710
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:30,191
Okay?

711
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:31,993
In the meantime, we'll get you
a crate of cough drops.

712
00:40:31,995 --> 00:40:33,694
I'm fine.

713
00:40:33,696 --> 00:40:36,531
It's all part
of being human, right?

714
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:39,167
Mm.

715
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,944
You sure you're okay?

716
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:56,250
I don't know.

717
00:41:00,356 --> 00:41:04,025
Jack! Jack.

718
00:41:04,027 --> 00:41:06,527
Jack!

719
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,466
Jack!
