1
00:00:00,932 --> 00:00:02,633
I can feel him
in my head.

2
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:04,668
Michael gets out,
that's it for this world.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,770
Billie. She said that
there's only one way

4
00:00:06,772 --> 00:00:08,138
that this ends right.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,507
Ma'lak box.
Secured and warded.

6
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:13,644
Once inside, nothing gets out,
not even an archangel.

7
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,946
Plan is, charter a boat to
take me out to the Pacific.

8
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:17,514
- Splash.
- You and Michael,

9
00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:19,616
trapped together --
for eternity?

10
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,692
When Jack's grace
was taken from him,

11
00:00:28,694 --> 00:00:30,627
his being fell into chaos.

12
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:32,829
The cells are gobbling
each other up.

13
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:34,031
He's gone.

14
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:36,533
My magic draws power
from the soul.

15
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:38,435
- It could save him.
- How much of it?

16
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:40,037
As long
as he's only using it

17
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,839
to sustain his body,
it won't cost much.

18
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:44,441
He'll never miss it.

19
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:50,981
We're the guys
who save that world.

20
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:53,216
Sam, I have
tried everything.

21
00:00:53,218 --> 00:00:55,952
- I believe in us.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

22
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:00,457
Why don't you
believe in us, too?

23
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:03,060
Okay, Sam.

24
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:04,327
Maybe Billie's wrong.

25
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:05,796
But I do believe in us.

26
00:01:05,798 --> 00:01:07,397
And I'll keep believing
until I can't.

27
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:08,832
But when
that day comes --

28
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:11,702
<i>if</i> that day comes...

29
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:16,139
...Sam, you have to take it
for what it is --

30
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:17,507
the end.

31
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:20,577
All right. All right.

32
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:35,819
Now, we keep getting
interrupted, don't we, Felix?

33
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,654
So let's just make sure
we have enough time

34
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:40,123
for a proper supper tonight,
shall we?

35
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:01,144
They're on their way again,
Felix.

36
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:03,280
Time to go.

37
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,918
A snack for later.

38
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:26,267

00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:56,066
Oh, no.

41
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,721
He's cooking the body parts...

42
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:21,024
again.

43
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:22,292
I got nothing.

44
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:25,195
Aw, come on.

45
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:27,764
Seriously? How does this
keep happening?

46
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:29,833
I thought we had him
this time.

47
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:32,035
Look at this.
He's all cut up.

48
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:33,937
No restraints,
like last time.

49
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:35,672
And he was
killed recently.

50
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:37,974
I suspect he was very much alive
when the cutting started.

51
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:39,276
I don't understand.

52
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,011
Why don't any of them
fight back?

53
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:42,913
Yeah. Who would just let
themselves be eaten?

54
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,948
Hey, I'll say it again.
My money's on witchcraft.

55
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,283
Och, you.

56
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:47,984
Always blaming witches.

57
00:04:47,986 --> 00:04:50,620
'Cause a lot of times
it's witches.

58
00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:54,024
Rowena, your tracking spell was
supposed to make this easier.

59
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:55,725
Huh!

60
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:58,261
There I was, in the middle
of a glorious

61
00:04:58,263 --> 00:05:00,463
rosewater and vanilla-oil
massage,

62
00:05:00,465 --> 00:05:03,233
hidden away at an exclusive
desert spa,

63
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:06,903
when you called me,
begging for my help.

64
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:09,572
Well, because we've been chasing
this guy for weeks.

65
00:05:09,574 --> 00:05:10,573
What's your point?

66
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:12,642
My point, Dean,

67
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:15,312
is that you asked for my
assistance, and I obliged.

68
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,880
And while the killer
eluded us,

69
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:18,648
it certainly looks as if
he was here quite recently.

70
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,216
I'd call that a success.

71
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:22,953
Oh, yeah, that's a success.
Sam.

72
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:26,656
Hello, Castiel.

73
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:31,094
Okay, looks like
our dinner guest here,

74
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:32,429
his name is Dennis Barron.

75
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:35,498
He's 43, and this is his house.

76
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,901
No signs of forced entry
and no restraints.

77
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:39,402
- It's all the same.
- Yep.

78
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:43,840
Well, not...everything.

79
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:45,308
Maybe it's his pet.

80
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,844
I mean, no pictures
in his phone.

81
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:51,414
And, uh, this place doesn't
exactly scream "snake guy."

82
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,551
Not enough Pantera posters,
for one.

83
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,591
There was some pepper
on something.

84
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,860
I don't know. I'm fine.

85
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:06,029
I'm not dying.

86
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:08,965
Okay, so, what?
This guy's some real Houdini?

87
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:11,501
Well, however he's avoiding us,
he's now claimed the lives

88
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:15,038
of at least six people
in northern New Mexico.

89
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,773
That we know about.

90
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:19,275
Aye, but this is the first one
I've seen in the flesh.

91
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:21,711
Did they all have these
blackened lips?

92
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:24,314
Yeah, or just
black patches of skin

93
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:25,715
around their face and neck.

94
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:27,117
Yeah, but we've been
more focused on

95
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:30,420
the "missing eyeballs
and cannibalism" angle.

96
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,224
Do the black lips
mean something?

97
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:38,061
Darling boy,
everything means something.

98
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:41,131
Be a dear and bring
the snakeskin.

99
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,382
You know, the last time I saw
Jack, he was on death's door.

100
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,055
You say, "Oh,
it's just some magic,"

101
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,757
and you think
I'll leave it at that?

102
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,093
Okay, listen.

103
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:13,063
Jack is all right.
You don't need to worry.

104
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,433
Oh, I wouldn't say worried.
More curious.

105
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:19,769
Speaking of which,
I'm also curious

106
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:22,739
as to how your brother is
managing to keep an archangel

107
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:24,874
locked away
inside his mind.

108
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:27,277
Because...he's Dean.

109
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,079
And Dean is Dean.

110
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,280
He's fine.

111
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:32,282
For how long?

112
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,252
We're working on it,
Rowena, another way to --

113
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:38,337
to keep Michael locked up
or -- or kill him --

114
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:38,926
But?

115
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,307
But, for now,
staying busy is good.

116
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,259
For all of us.

117
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:47,130
Okay.

118
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:49,232
You know, I got to say, I got
a pretty good feeling

119
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:50,867
about bringing Rowena in
on this one.

120
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:52,902
I think her and Sam have
a chance of cracking it.

121
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,205
They do have many books.

122
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:57,540
Yes, they do.

123
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:09,419
Hey, Dean?

124
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:10,820
I'm fine.

125
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:12,622
What you're doing,
even just sitting here

126
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:14,657
and having a cup of coffee,
is a Herculean feat.

127
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:16,426
I can't imagine
the willpower

128
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:20,130
it's taking to...
keep Michael imprisoned.

129
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:56,866
Are you really fine?

130
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:59,202
I don't know, Cass.

131
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:03,206
But that's what I'm
supposed to say, right?

132
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,175
"I'm fine,"
keep on moving?

133
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,709
That's what we all say.

134
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:08,411
No, Dean.

135
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:13,049
Okay.

136
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:17,854
There's this pounding
in my head.

137
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,722
It never stops.

138
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,493
Michael's in there,

139
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:26,229
and he is fighting hard
to get out.

140
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:32,835
And I can't let
my guard down...

141
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:35,238
not for a second.

142
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,308
I'm barely even sleeping.

143
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,476
Well, that's not
sustainable.

144
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:42,512
No. No.
It's probably not.

145
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:46,416
But...no point in
complaining about it.

146
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:47,717
It's on me.

147
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:50,486
No. It's on <i>us.</i>

148
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:53,056
We are here to help you.

149
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:54,857
I know.
I know that.

150
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:56,759
And I appreciate that.

151
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:58,828
I do.

152
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,517
Look, before the kid
gets back --

153
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,620
I know I agreed
to give you guys time.

154
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:26,623
Hey, Dean, and we will
find a solution.

155
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:32,428
Okay. But if --
if you don't...

156
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,796
we still have Plan B.

157
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:35,632
Dean, come on.

158
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:40,370
Coffin. Ocean. Done.

159
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:41,638
Here's an order for 18.

160
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:52,749
Are you all right?

161
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:54,250
I'm fine.

162
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:57,487
Hey, see? Look at that.
Everybody's fine.

163
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:58,988
- What?
- Nothing.

164
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:07,330
Okay, um...

165
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:09,065
these killings --

166
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:12,635
it seems like there's
a ritualistic quality

167
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:15,171
to the crime scenes, right?
It's almost liturgical.

168
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:22,412
It means religious.

169
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:24,647
Ah. Yeah.
See, that one I knew.

170
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:26,149
Ah.
Maybe we're wrong and --

171
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:27,884
and this isn't
a monster at all.

172
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:32,188
Maybe this is just a deranged
person who's been getting lucky.

173
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,158
Anyone who could do this
is a monster...

174
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,794
I mean,
even if they're human.

175
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:39,362
Kid's not wrong.

176
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:43,599
Yeah.

177
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:47,470
Okay. Got it.

178
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:49,806
Looks like Sam and Rowena
have something.

179
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:53,776
Okay, so, we've made
some progress.

180
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:56,312
This is like an A.V. Club
presentation.

181
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:57,714
What's an A.V. Club?

182
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:01,317
It's a special group for people
who do not play sports.

183
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:03,186
Yeah, him.
He's A.V. Club.

184
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:05,855
Excuse me, boys, but this is
a bit more pressing

185
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:07,557
than your
hilarious banter.

186
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:12,895
I believe we are
hunting a gorgon,

187
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:16,299
an ancient, cursed being
with an affinity for snakes

188
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:18,434
and a hunger
for human flesh.

189
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,803
Snakes for hair?
That's like Medusa.

190
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:22,572
You know about Medusa?

191
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:24,107
Oh, yeah.

192
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:26,642
"Clash of the Titans"?
Turns guys to stone?

193
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:32,315
Oh. That's the exaggerated
version. It's not stone.

194
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:34,117
More of a venom-induced
paralysis.

195
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,585
Hence,
the blackened lips.

196
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,387
And the fact that the victims
didn't fight back.

197
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,022
And the snakeskin, which,
frankly, was a bit on the nose.

198
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:41,591
Yeah.

199
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:43,826
So we expanded our search
based on this new information,

200
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:47,430
and we found 17 unexplained
deaths that could fit our guy,

201
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:50,733
last three months, moving west
across the southern U.S.

202
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:54,504
- 17 people.
- Yeah.

203
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:56,639
Legend has it,
every few months,

204
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:59,442
the gorgon goes on a spree
and gorges itself.

205
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:01,711
Like a snake.
That makes sense.

206
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:03,479
So, is there
anything in there

207
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:06,015
that explains why this gorgon
keeps eluding us?

208
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:07,784
Uh...

209
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:11,687
some lore says that a gorgon
can tell people's fates,

210
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:14,524
and, by consuming
human eyes,

211
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:17,527
they may
"glimpse the future."

212
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:20,963
Yeah. We think that's how
he sees us coming.

213
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:23,366
So, then even if we use
your tracking spell again,

214
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:25,101
he'll know.

215
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:27,804
So...
how do we get him?

216
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,739
I don't know.

217
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:40,583
Need something, fella?

218
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:42,718
I really need a ride.

219
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,287
Not a taxi.

220
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:46,389
And some food.
I'm kind of starving.

221
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:48,758
I'm not a cook,
either.

222
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,060
Really appreciate
any help.

223
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:53,963
And I'd find a way
to pay you back.

224
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:55,431
Yeah?

225
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,066
Definitely.

226
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:59,035
Anything you want.

227
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:01,604
And I've always had
a sense about people.

228
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:03,739
And I can tell
that you...

229
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:06,676
definitely...
want things.

230
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,180
Get in.
We'll work it out.

231
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,524
So, uh...

232
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:25,661
you ready to do,
uh...anything?

233
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:41,377
You're gonna have
to do better than that if --

234
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:43,479
I'm so glad
we got in the truck.

235
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:46,415
So much easier this way, isn't it?

236
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:48,851
Right now, my poison --
it's paralyzing you.

237
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:53,122
But, sadly, the numbing takes
a little while to kick in.

238
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:57,293
So, uh,
you're gonna feel this.

239
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:28,030
- Agents Page and Jones, FBI.
- Why is the FBI --

240
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:30,199
We had a few more of these
across state lines.

241
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:31,533
Anything unusual?

242
00:15:31,535 --> 00:15:33,669
Other than the guy
missing his eyes?

243
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:35,604
Is this amusing to you?

244
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:38,440
Uh...n-no, sir.

245
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:41,010
Sorry.
I, uh...

246
00:15:41,012 --> 00:15:42,611
I'm just
a little freaked out.

247
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:44,446
I've never seen
anything like this.

248
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:45,781
And, uh...

249
00:15:45,783 --> 00:15:48,017
Yes, there is
one other thing --

250
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:49,618
a note on the body.

251
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,953
A note?

252
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:52,388
Yeah.

253
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,391
It's made out
to some guy named Dean.

254
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:57,926
Can I see that?

255
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:02,031
Thank you.

256
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:04,400
Excuse me.

257
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:06,235
What does it say?

258
00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:10,172
"Dean, I see you standing alone
by the truck reading this note."

259
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:15,544
"I see you and the tall man and
the red-headed witch chasing me.

260
00:16:15,546 --> 00:16:17,880
I will always see you.

261
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:21,917
Stop, or I will make you stop.
Regards, Noah."

262
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:25,087
I'm on a first-name basis
with some psycho pen pal.

263
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:26,622
That's aces.

264
00:16:26,624 --> 00:16:28,557
Somehow he knows you.

265
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,160
But you're not standing alone.
Why doesn't he mention me?

266
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,129
Maybe you're not his type.

267
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,866
<i>So, Noah can see</i>
<i>you, me, and Rowena.</i>

268
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:39,568
For the record, I don't love

269
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,503
being included
on his little hit list.

270
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:43,272
But can't see
Cass and Jack?

271
00:16:43,274 --> 00:16:45,841
<i>It's an odd and glaring</i>
<i>omission.</i>

272
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:47,476
No.

273
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:49,778
It's our shot.

274
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,613
I mean, this guy --

275
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:53,615
for some reason,
he -- he can't see angels.

276
00:16:53,617 --> 00:16:55,751
I'm not an angel.

277
00:16:55,753 --> 00:16:57,953
<i>Well, apparently</i>
<i>you're close enough.</i>

278
00:16:57,955 --> 00:17:00,355
So, if Jack and I approach
Noah on our own,

279
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:02,458
we -- we may
surprise him.

280
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,127
Yeah. I-It's risky.

281
00:17:05,129 --> 00:17:07,529
But I-I think
it's probably our best play.

282
00:17:07,531 --> 00:17:10,265
Rowena, get your
tracking spell ready.

283
00:17:11,602 --> 00:17:13,936
Okay.

284
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:15,771
- Everything you need?
- Aye, but I should mix up

285
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:17,639
an antidote
to the gorgon's poison

286
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:19,608
in case one of you boys
gets sloppy.

287
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,777
I'll just need a wee bit
of antivenom.

288
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:23,787
Antivenom is a controlled substance.
How do you --

289
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:24,881
Don't worry.

290
00:17:24,882 --> 00:17:27,216
I have a plan.

291
00:17:31,388 --> 00:17:34,289
Help!
Please help us!

292
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,225
It's our wee doggie --
he's so sick!

293
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:38,060
He's not responding.
He's lethargic.

294
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:40,229
We -- We think he might have
eaten something.

295
00:17:40,231 --> 00:17:42,331
"We think"? "We think"?
He means that

296
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,633
it's my fault for not keeping
an eye on the poor dear.

297
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:46,368
He thinks that everything
is my fault.

298
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,903
Can we not fight
in front of the vet?

299
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:49,438
I mean, I guess it's not

300
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,006
entirely your fault
that you looked away!

301
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:52,341
He blames me
for everything!

302
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:55,344
I let his mother ride
the Jet Ski <i>one</i> time!

303
00:17:55,346 --> 00:17:57,179
Here, I'll just --
Let me take him.

304
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:59,381
Yeah. Great. Thanks.

305
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:02,584
What's his name?

306
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:03,919
Jack.

307
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:07,055
Jack. Wee Jackie boy.

308
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:08,524
His breathing's okay.

309
00:18:08,526 --> 00:18:10,425
Let me set him down in the back,
check his vitals.

310
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:11,860
Ah. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

311
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:14,062
Please help him. Oh.

312
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:18,767
What are you doing?

313
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:20,335
Oh, I mean,
I realize it's not...

314
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:22,237
...pretending to be the FBI.

315
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:24,039
But there are other ways

316
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,275
of doing things, Samuel.

317
00:18:26,277 --> 00:18:27,843
Plus...

318
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:32,548
I thought my performance
was quite magnificent.

319
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:36,351
Well, that was easy, wasn't it?

320
00:18:36,353 --> 00:18:39,454
You're the sweetest boy,
aren't you?

321
00:18:39,456 --> 00:18:43,425
I'm going to have Mommy
and Daddy fill out some forms.

322
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:45,727
You wait right there.

323
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,417
Well, he seems okay, but we're
gonna do some blood work

324
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:09,718
just to --

325
00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:35,377
Jack?! Jack?!

326
00:19:42,186 --> 00:19:45,520
- Oh, this will work perfectly.
- Great.

327
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:48,624
Just wish I could've got it
before she took my temperature.

328
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:52,995
Ohh.

329
00:19:52,997 --> 00:19:55,864
Right.
All right. Let's get.

330
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:58,367
Oh, uh, a moment, Samuel.

331
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:00,702
What?

332
00:20:01,805 --> 00:20:03,939
What did you do
to that boy?

333
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:06,041
When I cast
the transformation spell,

334
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:08,043
I felt something
else pushing back,

335
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:09,978
some <i>other</i> thing
inside him.

336
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,214
It's volatile magic,
powerful,

337
00:20:12,216 --> 00:20:16,051
and it's stitched to him
like some kind of parasite.

338
00:20:16,053 --> 00:20:17,686
I was curious before,

339
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:21,156
but now I am worried,
so I'll ask you again, Sam.

340
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:22,457
What did you do?

341
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:24,393
Okay, listen.
Jack's being careful.

342
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:26,628
We're all being careful.
That's all you need to know.

343
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,563
Fine.
Don't tell me.

344
00:20:28,565 --> 00:20:32,200
But using dangerous, mysterious
magic, regardless of the cost,

345
00:20:32,202 --> 00:20:34,670
that's a very on-brand
<i>me</i> thing to do.

346
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:36,405
Well, thank you.

347
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:38,340
Of course, Samuel.

348
00:20:38,342 --> 00:20:41,510
Until very recently,
I was the villain.

349
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,193
Mmm!

350
00:20:58,195 --> 00:21:01,096
He's being good and quiet,
isn't he, Felix?

351
00:21:01,098 --> 00:21:04,299
Because we made a deal,
didn't we?

352
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:09,771
He stays quiet,
no talking, no screaming,

353
00:21:09,773 --> 00:21:12,941
and he doesn't have to die
like all those other men.

354
00:21:12,943 --> 00:21:14,443
Oh.

355
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:17,446
Do you think he has
any vegetable oil?

356
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:22,551
'Cause Felix can't actually
talk, so you should respond.

357
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:25,454
It's in the cupboard...

358
00:21:25,456 --> 00:21:26,788
by the oven.

359
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,726
Oh, that's perfect.

360
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:33,128
Honestly, it's not like
I enjoy eating people.

361
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,797
It's a lonely way to live,

362
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:38,000
and there's only so many ways
you can cook human.

363
00:21:39,403 --> 00:21:43,372
But sometimes fate
is cruel <i>and</i> boring.

364
00:21:43,374 --> 00:21:44,873
Am I right?

365
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,209
You're not --
You're not serious.

366
00:21:47,211 --> 00:21:49,478
Maybe you just have
a concussion.

367
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,582
Maybe this is all
a hallucination?

368
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:56,918
Ha! "Serious"?

369
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,589
Ask the men of New Mexico
if I'm serious.

370
00:22:00,591 --> 00:22:03,425
That's a pretty biased sample
at this point, really.

371
00:22:03,427 --> 00:22:05,494
The men of...

372
00:22:05,496 --> 00:22:08,830
You're just preying on --
on helpless men?

373
00:22:10,234 --> 00:22:12,334
"Helpless men" --
that's rich.

374
00:22:12,336 --> 00:22:15,103
No, I do eat ladies, too,

375
00:22:15,105 --> 00:22:17,172
but women have become
so cautious lately.

376
00:22:17,174 --> 00:22:18,974
Must be all that
finally waking up

377
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:21,109
from centuries of
misogynistic oppression.

378
00:22:21,111 --> 00:22:23,912
Good for them.
Bad for you.

379
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,451
It's so bad for him,
isn't it, Felix?

380
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:32,921
No! Help!
Help! Someone!

381
00:22:32,923 --> 00:22:35,457
Ohh! Unh-unh-unh, ohh!
you know the rules.

382
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:37,259
Help me!

383
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:40,829
Screaming's
a deal breaker.

384
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:42,464
I --

385
00:22:46,503 --> 00:22:48,837
Now let's go figure out
how to work that oven,

386
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,939
shall we, Felix?

387
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:04,119
- Do you have it?
<i>- According to the lore,</i>

388
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:05,620
the only way
to kill a gorgon

389
00:23:05,622 --> 00:23:08,123
is by cutting off its head
with a silver blade.

390
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,291
Great.

391
00:23:09,293 --> 00:23:11,259
<i>Why couldn't it just</i>
<i>be bullets, right?</i>

392
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:12,727
Yeah.

393
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:14,729
What about over there?
Everything okay?

394
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:19,468
It's quiet. We're good.

395
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,169
Oh, and Mary checked in.

396
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:22,637
<i>She finished up</i>
<i>that case in Oregon.</i>

397
00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:24,139
She's starting
her drive back tonight.

398
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:26,575
Great. Maggie, hey,
I really appreciate

399
00:23:26,577 --> 00:23:28,977
you stepping up and handling
things while we're gone.

400
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:30,579
- Be safe.
<i>- You bet.</i>

401
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:33,815
All right.

402
00:23:33,817 --> 00:23:37,519
- Everybody ready?
- Yes.

403
00:23:37,521 --> 00:23:40,489
He's less than an hour
west of us and not moving.

404
00:23:40,491 --> 00:23:42,757
All right, well,
break out the silver blades.

405
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,392
Maggie says decapitation

406
00:23:44,394 --> 00:23:45,927
is the only way
to kill these things.

407
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:47,362
But if we cut off
their head,

408
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:49,197
then is more creatures
gonna crawl out?

409
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:51,433
Wait.
Other creatures?

410
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:53,735
H-He's talking about
"Clash of the Titans" again.

411
00:23:53,737 --> 00:23:55,203
We don't know.

412
00:23:55,205 --> 00:23:58,740
A few drops of this concoction
should counteract any poison.

413
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,610
Theoretically.

414
00:24:01,612 --> 00:24:03,545
"Theoretically."
That's comforting.

415
00:24:03,547 --> 00:24:07,015
Yeah, well, assuming you're not
all paralyzed or eaten...

416
00:24:07,017 --> 00:24:08,783
off with his head.

417
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:21,730
I'm not expecting anyone.
Are <i>you?</i>

418
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:34,042
Oh, no fair.

419
00:24:34,044 --> 00:24:35,977
You're not human.

420
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:38,980
And you're a monster.
Demi-god, technically.

421
00:24:38,982 --> 00:24:41,216
You stay where you are.
Hey.

422
00:24:41,218 --> 00:24:43,418
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

423
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,120
Jack, watch him.

424
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,891
I didn't see you coming,
but I see you now.

425
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:52,427
Shut up.

426
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:54,496
Have you ever heard the story
of the black snake?

427
00:24:54,498 --> 00:24:56,898
Hey! Hands up.

428
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,234
Once there was
a crafty black snake

429
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:01,336
who kept eating this
poor chicken's eggs.

430
00:25:01,338 --> 00:25:04,105
She couldn't watch them
all the time, you see?

431
00:25:04,107 --> 00:25:06,274
The black snake would wait
until she was gone...

432
00:25:06,276 --> 00:25:08,410
...and then slide one of
the eggs into his mouth

433
00:25:08,412 --> 00:25:10,078
and crush it
in his throat.

434
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,281
Now, this went on until
there was only one egg left.

435
00:25:13,283 --> 00:25:15,483
But when the chicken
left that egg,

436
00:25:15,485 --> 00:25:18,220
just for a moment,
the snake swallowed it up.

437
00:25:18,222 --> 00:25:21,423
But for some reason, he couldn't
crush it in his throat.

438
00:25:21,425 --> 00:25:24,092
The chicken had hard-boiled
her final egg

439
00:25:24,094 --> 00:25:26,695
just to choke the snake.

440
00:25:26,697 --> 00:25:28,530
And the snake died.

441
00:25:28,532 --> 00:25:31,466
Why are you telling
this story?

442
00:25:31,468 --> 00:25:33,435
Because
I can't quite tell

443
00:25:33,437 --> 00:25:36,838
if he's the chicken...
or the snake.

444
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,542
We're done here.

445
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:56,791
Cass!

446
00:26:06,403 --> 00:26:07,836
Hello, Dean.

447
00:26:07,838 --> 00:26:09,871
Wish I could say it's nice
to meet you in person.

448
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:14,909
Yeah.
It's a real pleasure.

449
00:26:27,024 --> 00:26:28,223
Dean!

450
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,048
Dean!

451
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,383
Ready?

452
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,539
Check on Cass.

453
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,742
I got Dean.

454
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:12,746
Cass, can you breathe?

455
00:27:12,748 --> 00:27:16,082
Hey, hey, hey.

456
00:27:16,084 --> 00:27:18,251
Dean?

457
00:27:30,932 --> 00:27:32,599
It's not working.

458
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:34,334
Why isn't it working?!

459
00:27:34,336 --> 00:27:35,902
Cass?

460
00:27:47,949 --> 00:27:49,582
Jack, what are you doing?

461
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,251
You're okay.

462
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,389
Wake up!
Hey! Dean?

463
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:57,657
Guys!

464
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:02,929
Hey. Wake up. Dean.

465
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:17,477
W-Why won't he wake up?
Is he --

466
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:20,113
- It's a head injury.
- I'll get ice.

467
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,815
Cass, do it.

468
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,889
Well?

469
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:31,324
I still can't heal him.

470
00:28:31,326 --> 00:28:33,927
I can't even see what's
going on inside his head.

471
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:38,164
I can help.

472
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,633
No. Jack.

473
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,669
I appreciate what
you did for me,

474
00:28:42,671 --> 00:28:45,438
but you cannot afford to burn
off any more of your soul.

475
00:28:55,684 --> 00:28:57,684
So that's what
you have him doing?

476
00:28:57,686 --> 00:29:01,354
We'll talk about it later,
Rowena. Now is not a good time.

477
00:29:01,356 --> 00:29:04,090
Maybe the gorgon did something
to Dean before he --

478
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:05,859
Smashed his face
into the wall?

479
00:29:14,936 --> 00:29:17,637
What do I do?

480
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:20,340
Clean his wound.
Make him comfortable, then...

481
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,144
...we'll see.

482
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,726
Hey! Hey!

483
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:45,331
It's okay. It's okay.

484
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:46,533
It's okay.

485
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:19,933
Jack.

486
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:25,238
I hate seeing him
like that.

487
00:30:27,008 --> 00:30:30,610
But he's gonna
be okay, right?

488
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:34,380
I mean, it's Dean.

489
00:30:34,382 --> 00:30:36,783
He...

490
00:30:36,785 --> 00:30:38,251
It was a fight.

491
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,086
It was --
It was just a fight.

492
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,855
Every time we go out,
there's always a risk.

493
00:30:42,857 --> 00:30:45,091
I-I can't...

494
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:48,628
think about losing him

495
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,396
or -- or Sam or you.

496
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:54,968
I-I just -- I hate --
I hate thinking about it.

497
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,003
Yeah. So do I.

498
00:30:58,974 --> 00:31:01,241
But, Jack...

499
00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:03,977
you know, Sam and Dean,
they're human,

500
00:31:03,979 --> 00:31:07,714
and they're
very extraordinary,

501
00:31:07,716 --> 00:31:09,048
brave, special humans,

502
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,317
but they're --
they're still humans.

503
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:14,821
And humans burn bright,
but for a very brief time

504
00:31:14,823 --> 00:31:18,658
compared to, you know,
things like us.

505
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,996
And eventually, they're gone,
even the very best ones,

506
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:25,798
and we have to carry on.

507
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,767
It's just --

508
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:29,335
It's part of growing up.

509
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:31,638
Losing people?

510
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:34,941
Yes.

511
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:38,011
What's the point?

512
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:39,412
The point?

513
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:41,581
What's the point of
being a cosmic being

514
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:46,586
if everyone I care about
is just gonna...leave?

515
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:50,189
The point is that
they were here at all

516
00:31:50,191 --> 00:31:53,426
and you got to
know them, you --

517
00:31:53,428 --> 00:31:56,596
When they're gone,
it will hurt,

518
00:31:56,598 --> 00:32:00,566
but that hurt will remind you
of how much you loved them.

519
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:04,871
That sounds...

520
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,709
...awful.

521
00:32:09,711 --> 00:32:12,178
It is.
But it's also living.

522
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,481
So when Dean wakes up --
and he will wake up --

523
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:17,450
we just have to
remember to appreciate

524
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:20,119
the time that we all have
together now.

525
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:28,394
What if he doesn't
wake up?

526
00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:31,164
What about Michael?
What if --

527
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,398
I don't know, Jack.

528
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,167
Okay, but I could use
my powers.

529
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:37,470
No, Jack, I know you want
to help, but you cannot --

530
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:39,172
What is the good of
having these powers

531
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:40,873
if I can't help
the people that I love,

532
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,742
if I can't help them
when they need it?

533
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:44,410
Jack --
It's selfish of me not to.

534
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:45,912
I understand how
frustrating it is.

535
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:47,347
I know.

536
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,090
You're keeping the snake?

537
00:32:57,092 --> 00:32:59,092
Yeah.

538
00:32:59,094 --> 00:33:03,763
Rowena said that the gorgons
can see people's fate.

539
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,468
And Noah said
he could see me.

540
00:33:11,606 --> 00:33:13,272
That -- That story.

541
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:16,008
The story about the chicken
and the snake?

542
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,009
It was just...

543
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:18,578
He was stalling.

544
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,449
What does it mean?

545
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:26,919
Well, it's a story
about greed mostly.

546
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:31,391
But I guess it's also --

547
00:33:31,393 --> 00:33:35,628
it's also about being willing
to give up the thing you love...

548
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,597
in order to kill
the thing you hate.

549
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:44,470
He said that he didn't know if
I was the chicken or the snake.

550
00:33:44,472 --> 00:33:46,939
Does that --

551
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,275
Dean.

552
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,880
Where is he?!
Where is he?!

553
00:33:53,882 --> 00:33:55,281
No, wait!
Dean! Dean!

554
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,617
No! Stop! Dean, stop it!
It's -- It's me!

555
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,585
- You're in the bunker!
- I know where I am!

556
00:33:59,587 --> 00:34:02,288
That's not --

557
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,257
Dean.

558
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,496
He's gone.

559
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:20,139
Michael. He's gone.

560
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,176
How?

561
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:27,513
This is my fault.

562
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:29,682
I let my guard down.
This is my fault.

563
00:34:29,684 --> 00:34:32,018
- No, Dean --
- I told you!

564
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,253
I told you to let me
take that coffin ride

565
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:35,755
to the bottom
of the ocean!

566
00:34:35,757 --> 00:34:37,490
Okay, Dean, j-just --

567
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:42,261
Maggie?!

568
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:44,664
Sam!

569
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,668
Maggie!

570
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,317
No. No.

571
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,654
No.

572
00:35:15,129 --> 00:35:16,996
Hello, boys.

573
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:25,553
I could've
burned them all,

574
00:35:25,555 --> 00:35:28,522
but I'm feeling
very hands-on.

575
00:35:28,524 --> 00:35:29,857
Michael.

576
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:31,692
That's right.

577
00:35:31,694 --> 00:35:34,662
I thought you'd appreciate
this vessel.

578
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:38,132
You let her go.

579
00:35:38,134 --> 00:35:40,034
Oh. Please.

580
00:35:40,036 --> 00:35:42,703
She's much sturdier
than she looks.

581
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:45,539
Must be the hundreds
of years of magic.

582
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:47,241
Rowena never
would have let you in.

583
00:35:47,243 --> 00:35:51,078
She didn't want
to say yes, but...

584
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,041
Hello, Rowena.

585
00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:26,047
This is all
in your mind.

586
00:36:27,016 --> 00:36:29,417
You're not Dean.

587
00:36:29,419 --> 00:36:32,253
I was...for a while.

588
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:34,622
But it didn't work out.

589
00:36:34,624 --> 00:36:37,892
It was him, not me.

590
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:40,428
And now I'm looking
for a new home.

591
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,963
- A-And you think --
- If you say yes,

592
00:36:42,965 --> 00:36:45,566
I'll make you
this promise --

593
00:36:45,568 --> 00:36:47,268
I'll leave you alive.

594
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:54,809
I'll live either way.

595
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:56,977
Excuse me?

596
00:36:56,979 --> 00:36:59,647
Fate says Sam Winchester's
going to off me,

597
00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:01,282
which makes dinners
a bit awkward,

598
00:37:01,284 --> 00:37:05,152
but does give one a certain
sense of...security.

599
00:37:05,154 --> 00:37:08,322
So whilst I'm flattered,
I think we can both do better.

600
00:37:08,324 --> 00:37:10,157
Hmm.

601
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,459
Fine.

602
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:13,327
Then how about this --

603
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:17,798
I'll leave you alive,
find another host,

604
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,836
and then I'll kill every one of
the people in this bunker...

605
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,073
everyone you care about.

606
00:37:26,075 --> 00:37:28,576
And you do care
about them,

607
00:37:28,578 --> 00:37:30,678
no matter
what you tell them,

608
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,447
no matter what
you tell yourself.

609
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:36,083
So...

610
00:37:36,085 --> 00:37:38,185
say yes.

611
00:37:38,187 --> 00:37:41,355
Choice is yours.

612
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:54,835
I had no
intention of keeping my word,

613
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:57,872
but I think she knew that.

614
00:37:57,874 --> 00:38:02,877
If only Dean had used that
coffin when he had the chance.

615
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:04,912
Never too late
for a good idea.

616
00:38:04,914 --> 00:38:06,180
Sam, get the cuffs.

617
00:38:10,953 --> 00:38:14,021
That's not very nice.

618
00:38:14,023 --> 00:38:16,524
And if we're not
being nice,

619
00:38:16,526 --> 00:38:20,027
what if...
you couldn't breathe?

620
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:25,199
That's a terrible feeling,
isn't it?

621
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:27,134
What if you were also blind?

622
00:38:28,571 --> 00:38:31,839
Sam.

623
00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:37,645
And what if
you just hurt?

624
00:38:39,816 --> 00:38:43,651
But...fun as this is,

625
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:46,754
I think...no more games.

626
00:38:48,825 --> 00:38:52,560
This time, you all die.

627
00:38:52,562 --> 00:38:55,696
This time, the world burns.

628
00:38:56,799 --> 00:38:58,532
Michael!

629
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:09,262
Let them go.

630
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,764
You think you can
match me, boy?

631
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:16,136
This power you have now --
it's nothing, just a crutch.

632
00:39:24,045 --> 00:39:25,778
How dare you!

633
00:39:27,983 --> 00:39:31,417
Burning off your soul?
You'll run out soon enough.

634
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:34,988
It's worth the cost.

635
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:38,658
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

636
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,961
I feel the same.

637
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,831
I am the commander
of the host!

638
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:47,333
I am the cleanser
of worlds!

639
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:50,236
I will not be challenged
by a child!

640
00:39:50,238 --> 00:39:52,305
I'm not a child!

641
00:39:55,343 --> 00:39:57,010
I'm the son of Lucifer.

642
00:39:57,012 --> 00:39:58,578
I'm a Hunter.

643
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,480
I am a Winchester!

644
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,083
Jack! No!

645
00:40:14,596 --> 00:40:17,864
You won't hurt anyone
ever again!

646
00:40:46,628 --> 00:40:48,628
Jack?

647
00:40:52,968 --> 00:40:55,702
Michael.

648
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:58,204
He's dead.

649
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,406
Jack, a-are you, uh --

650
00:41:10,585 --> 00:41:13,086
I'm me again.
