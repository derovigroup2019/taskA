1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,568
I am a Winchester!

2
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:04,037
Jack, no!

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,779
I'm me again.

4
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,583
Jack, you have your powers back?

5
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:21,488
I think so.

6
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,056
And your soul?

7
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,925
You want to know
how much of my soul

8
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:27,094
I had to burn off
to kill Michael.

9
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:29,696
Yes.

10
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,299
I don't know.

11
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,740
Nick. He's trying
to resurrect Lucifer.

12
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,944
I can get us to him.

13
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,512
But I need to use my powers.

14
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,748
Do it.

15
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,750
Stop!

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,052
Jack, stop.
What are you doing?

17
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,689
- Where's Nick?
- It's over.

18
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,824
- What about Mom?
- She's fine.

19
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,593
Everything's gonna be fine.

20
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:05,332
Nick, he was a bad person,
a killer. He deserved it.

21
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:06,400
Not like that.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,768
- Leave me alone!
- Please. Just...

23
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:09,202
- Leave me alone!
- Jack!

24
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,637
Something's wrong.

25
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,706
- Listen to me!
- Leave me alone!

26
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,076
Mary?

27
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,395
- Yo, Mom!
- Mom!

28
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,465
Jack?

29
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,033
Mom?

30
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,636
- Hey, Jack?
- Jack?

31
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,471
Jack?
Yo, anybody here?

32
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,074
Mom?

33
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,509
Mom?

34
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,045
Jack?

35
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,085
Nothing.

36
00:01:58,085 --> 00:01:59,920
They probably just stopped
for a bite on the way back.

37
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,755
You know how Mom gets
after a Hunt.

38
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,091
Yeah. True that.

39
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,826
Well, hey, here's to another

40
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,861
miraculous Sam Winchester
survival.

41
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,664
Got to say, man, if Jack
hadn't have healed you...

42
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,733
You know, lately, it feels like

43
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,267
we'd be up the creek
without that kid.

44
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,470
Yep. I mean, first,
he takes care of Michael

45
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,406
and then... Nick.

46
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,708
Kind of sounds like you're
bummed about it.

47
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,678
No. A "get out of
jail free" card?

48
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,179
I'll take that.

49
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,447
Gonna try Mom?

50
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,548
Yeah.

51
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,565
Looks like they left in a hurry.

52
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,134
Try Jack.

55
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:10,857
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Okay. All right, thanks.

56
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,426
What did Jody say?

57
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:13,894
She hasn't heard anything.
You?

58
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:18,098
Nada. Left voicemails for
Donna, Charlie, Bobby.

59
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,299
- Rowena?
- Yeah.

60
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,400
Just got off the phone with her.

61
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,836
She says she has a spell
that might track them down.

62
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,971
- Okay, well, that's good.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,310
Hey, Cass.

64
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,945
Castiel:
I got your message.

65
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,647
Nick was trying
to raise Lucifer?

66
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,615
- Yeah.
- Where is he now?

67
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,018
I don't, uh...
Kid said he took care of him.

68
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,120
So, right now, we're just
trying to find Jack and Mom.

69
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,457
- Are they together?
- Yeah.

70
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,925
A-Alone?

71
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,894
Y-Yeah.
W-Why do you...

72
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,529
Yes, Cass, they were
together, alone.

73
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,264
What's he saying?

74
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,799
I don't...

75
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,334
Cass?

76
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,673
I, um...

77
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:02,042
If you have something to
tell us, now's the time.

78
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:05,078
I saw Jack. He... He...
He did something

79
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,480
when I got home with Sam.

80
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,683
I went to check on him,
and Felix was sick.

81
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,452
- Felix? You mean the snake?
- Yes.

82
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,590
Jack used his powers.

83
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,024
He killed the snake.

84
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,994
I think Jack
considered it a mercy.

85
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,496
I-I was gonna tell you, but...

86
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,798
You just wanted to wait until
we were already freaked out.

87
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,900
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,236
I don't think
Jack is well, Dean.

89
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,471
Dean?

90
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,743
- What?
- He said that Jack

91
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,712
went all Kevorkian on his snake.

92
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,181
- Why?
- I don't know. Who cares.

93
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,149
It's a snake.

94
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,151
Right now,
we've got to find them.

95
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,389
I think I have an idea.

96
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,558
This will work?

97
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,561
As long as Jack's battery's
running, probably.

98
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,263
There we go.
Look.

99
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:58,165
Wait. Is that...?

100
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,633
Nepal?

101
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,272
Wait a second.
W-Where'd he go?

102
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,707
There.

103
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,911
Lima, Peru.

104
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,779
Jack's flying.

105
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,315
Paris, France.

106
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,222
What the hell is he doing?

107
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,732
Jack:
You knew my mother.

108
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,801
I was there when you were born.

109
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,370
Stop!

110
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,641
Jack, what you did
was... amazing.

111
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:18,945
Jack, please!
Just... Listen to me!

112
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,080
Leave me alone!

113
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,794
Nick?

114
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,731
Mm. Guess again.

115
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,503
"Hello, Son."

116
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,673
No. That's not possible.
You're...

117
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,975
Dead?

118
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,445
All right.
You got me.

119
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,749
I'm not Nick.
I'm not Lucifer.

120
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,816
I'm you.

121
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,653
What?

122
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,889
Yeah. I'm your, you know,
subconscious or whatever.

123
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,425
Y-You whipped me up to
help you figure this out.

124
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,833
Whatever you are...

125
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,302
I don't want your help.

126
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,704
Actually, you do.

127
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:20,040
So I'm gonna give you a little
piece of advice, bud,

128
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,878
how you can wiggle out of
this little pickle you're in.

129
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:27,080
You don't.

130
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,717
You won't.

131
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,118
You can't.

132
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,020
All right?

133
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,857
Buddy, you killed
Mary Winchester.

134
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:41,728
You cannot come back from that,
and you know it.

135
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,730
All right? You've been
flapping your wings all around,

136
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,432
trying to run away
from what you did,

137
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,600
and where'd you wind up?

138
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,671
Right here, right back
to the scene of the crime.

139
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,239
- No.
- Yeah.

140
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,875
Yeah, because somewhere
inside, you realize

141
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:59,579
that the sooner you accept it,
the easier it'll be.

142
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,715
No, it's...

143
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,653
It was an accident.

144
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,154
Okay.

145
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,156
Tell Sam and Dean that.

146
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,458
I'm sure they'll understand.

147
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,193
It's not like family
isn't everything to them.

148
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,527
- Shut up.
- No, I'm serious.

149
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,463
Pull out your cellphone
right now and call them.

150
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,932
Shut up!

151
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:38,084
All right.
Cass is gonna meet us there.

152
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,990
You know, maybe Jack
was wrong, you know?

153
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,525
I mean, maybe
Nick pulled it off,

154
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,460
maybe Lucifer's back,
and he took them both.

155
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,330
And... And Jack... I mean...

156
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,700
he must have thought he was
helping, you know, being kind.

157
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,901
What?

158
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,404
With... Felix.

159
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,173
Wait. Really?
With the snake?

160
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,008
I'm just saying, Dean.

161
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,611
I'm trying to understand
Jack without a soul.

162
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,246
We don't know that
he doesn't have a soul!

163
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,381
Okay, I don't want to...
Let's...

164
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,517
Let's just not talk
about it, all right?

165
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:14,220
Let's just find Mom.
We'll find Jack.

166
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,056
We'll figure it all out.

167
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,259
All right.

168
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,898
- Uh-oh.
- What?

169
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,668
You look inside.
I'll take around back.

170
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,587
Jack?

171
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,602
Mom?!

172
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,561
Dean!

173
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:12,038
Dean?

174
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,511
Dean.

175
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,181
In the cabin, it's... it's...

176
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,712
Well, that was a close one.

177
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,148
Not that close.

178
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,652
I counted wrong.

179
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:03,156
I thought there were only
two vamps in the basement.

180
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,058
I handled the third one.

181
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,626
Yes, you certainly did.

182
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:07,760
Mmm.

183
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,630
You know, I'm no expert,
but I think most humans

184
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,767
would bandage an open wound
before stopping to eat.

185
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,937
It's a scratch.

186
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,239
Still...

187
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,641
I could heal you.

188
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,512
If you'll let me.

189
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,249
I'm... I'm okay.

190
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:34,654
Are you still afraid of me?

191
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,192
Maybe a little.

192
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,231
I haven't been back that long.

193
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,667
Angels are real.
Angels are friends.

194
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:51,004
Angels can heal you
with a wave of a glowy hand.

195
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,574
I... It's all pretty new still.

196
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,345
We should get back.

197
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,647
Boys will be waiting.

198
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,833
I know you know this, Mary,
but, um...

199
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,170
Sam and Dean... they're...
They're glad to have you back.

200
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,273
Whatever you still
have to deal with

201
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,009
and however long it takes,

202
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,878
you should know they're happy.

203
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:38,017
I mean, finally, they don't
have to be so, um...

204
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,019
so alone.

205
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,928
Castiel.

206
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,963
They were never alone.

207
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,535
They were never alone.

208
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,793
Dean, if Jack did that...

209
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,595
Hey, we don't know
what happened, okay?

210
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,297
I mean, we don't know
what Nick did.

211
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,065
He probably deserved it.

212
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,735
Dean, look. No one wanted
Nick dead more than I did,

213
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,471
but... I mean, that...

214
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,142
Cass.

215
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,847
Is that Nick?

216
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,348
Yeah.

217
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:46,719
We looked around.
No sign of Jack or Mom.

218
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,022
There's a, um, blast site
behind the house.

219
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,559
It looks angelic,
just... bigger.

220
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,428
Might have been Lucifer.

221
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,929
Nick was trying
to bring him back.

222
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,531
- Yeah, but Jack said...
- Who cares what Jack said?

223
00:14:58,531 --> 00:14:59,932
We don't know what happened!

224
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:04,437
But I swear, if he did
something to her, if she is...

225
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,374
Then you're dead to me.

226
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,210
- Dean.
- No, he knew.

227
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,279
He knew something
was wrong with the kid.

228
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,314
He knew it,
and he didn't tell us!

229
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,483
He didn't even tell us!

230
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,324
Castiel:
I was scared.

231
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,661
I believed in Jack
for so long, I...

232
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:34,801
I believed that he was...
He was good.

233
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:38,037
I... I knew that he would be
good for the world.

234
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,640
And he was good for us.

235
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:47,046
My faith in him,
it... it never wavered,

236
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:50,049
and then I-I saw what he did.

237
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,287
It wasn't malice.
It wasn't evil.

238
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,922
It was like Jack saw a problem,

239
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:59,525
and in his mind, he just
solved it with that snake.

240
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,527
The snake?!

241
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,797
What he did wasn't bad.

242
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,600
It was the absence of good.

243
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,235
And I saw that in him.

244
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:13,706
But we were a family,
and I didn't want to lose that,

245
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,809
so I thought I could...
fix it on my own.

246
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,778
Felt like it was
my responsibility.

247
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:22,615
So I left.
And I didn't tell you.

248
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,518
If I could go back and just...

249
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:29,322
Just talk to him right
then and there, I would.

250
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,390
But I can't, Dean.

251
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,427
I failed you.

252
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,129
And I failed Jack.

253
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,497
And I failed...

254
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,400
No, no. Don't even say it.
Don't even say her name.

255
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,202
Dean.

256
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,244
Who is it?

257
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,712
Rowena.

258
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,381
Hey.

259
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,584
Hello, Samuel.
I did what you asked.

260
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,721
I used scrying magic on the boy,
tried to find him.

261
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,923
But his energy,
it's too unstable.

262
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,925
It was like looking at the sun.

263
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,059
And Mom?

264
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:09,996
Say it!

265
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:16,269
I don't know what happened
or where she is...

266
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:19,238
but I can tell you
with certainty...

267
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,341
Mary Winchester
is no longer on this Earth.

268
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,585
So, what do we do?

269
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,021
What do we always do
when we lose one of our own?

270
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,758
We fight.

271
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,061
We fight to bring them back.

272
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,429
How?

273
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,698
Billie?

274
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,570
Rowena. She's got
the Book of the Damned.

275
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,306
She's resurrected herself
more times than we can count.

276
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,709
How? We don't even know
where your mother is.

277
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:33,346
Then go to heaven and find her!

278
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,384
Tell Rowena we're on our way.

279
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:54,033
"Magice Necromantiorum."

280
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,437
That was fast.

281
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:03,676
Oh, boy.

282
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,419
Hello, Rowena.

283
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:23,329
Are you... Are you well?

284
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,498
Sam and Dean
are looking for you.

285
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,333
I-I could call them.

286
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,601
No!

287
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,469
I need help.
I need magic.

288
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,104
Why?

289
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,445
I killed Mary.

290
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,255
I-It was an accident.
I-I didn't mean to.

291
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,823
I just... I just wanted her
to be quiet.

292
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,992
I just wanted her gone,
but only for a second.

293
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:56,462
And I just..

294
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,765
I thought it.

295
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,805
It all happened so fast.

296
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,444
I need to undo it.

297
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,548
You need to help me undo it.

298
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,920
I, uh...

299
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,289
The magic I've used on myself,

300
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,525
my... my little
subdermal sachets...

301
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,694
They only work as fail-safes.

302
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,997
They have to be prepared
in advance, Jack.

303
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,700
Um...

304
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,436
What about the book?

305
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,072
The book. Yes. Yes.
The... The book.

306
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:44,076
I mean, there...
There is a spell.

307
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,380
Agnes, the witch
who created the Book,

308
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,649
was a prisoner for years.

309
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,985
She was obsessed
with breaking curses.

310
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:56,288
What is death
but the ultimate curse?

311
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:59,925
In captivity, her friends,
her only companions

312
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,293
starved and perished,

313
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,130
so she developed a spell
to bring them back...

314
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,768
The "Magice
Necromantiorum."

315
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:14,740
Okay.
What will we need?

316
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,510
Oh, well, um...

317
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:21,280
the Necromantiorum
requires enormous power.

318
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,984
The ingredients are
relatively simple.

319
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:28,053
Um, nothing you wouldn't have...

320
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,623
handy in the bunker.

321
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:34,627
Rowena?!
Open up!

322
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,395
You've been stalling me...

323
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,164
- Rowena?!
- ...tricking me!

324
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,332
Just talk to them, Jack.
They're your kin.

325
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,101
Dean:
Come on! Open up!

326
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,113
Hello?

327
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,954
Hello?

328
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,671
Naomi.

329
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,781
- Jack!
- Come on.

330
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,798
- Okay.
- Outward position.

331
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:48,000
- Right. Index.
- Index finger.

332
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,268
- Flip.
- Thumb.

333
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:50,703
No, keep your finger over there.

334
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:51,971
- All right.
- Thumb.

335
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,206
And then switch it all around.

336
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,508
There you go.
Right.

337
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,645
Outward position.
Index, flip...

338
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,251
That's okay.
That one was close.

339
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:06,619
That's enough for today.

340
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:10,289
You're doing great.
It's not easy.

341
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:15,594
When we get Dean back,
he's gonna kill me for this.

342
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,437
For what?

343
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,382
- Hey.
- Hey.

344
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,350
How's his training coming along?

345
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,321
He's got heart.
He'll get there.

346
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:45,691
I feel bad. I've been so busy
looking for Dean...

347
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:49,028
Sam, everyone here understands
what you've been doing

348
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:50,863
and what you've been
putting yourself through.

349
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:54,300
Yeah, I know, but Jack's been through
a lot... you know, losing his powers.

350
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,602
And I haven't really
been there for him.

351
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,840
Sorry, Mom. I don't mean
to lay all this on you.

352
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,443
No. Are you kidding?

353
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,913
It's nice knowing
I'm not the only one...

354
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,316
with parental guilt.

355
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:13,185
How much did the two of you
go through

356
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,887
when I wasn't there for you?

357
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:18,857
And even when Amara brought me
back and I got a second chance,

358
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,860
things got complicated.

359
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,395
I got complicated.

360
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,296
Mom.

361
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,831
No, I'm just saying...

362
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,933
parenting is always a struggle.

363
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,436
You always feel like
you're failing,

364
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:33,906
but then you look at them,
and somehow, they're amazing.

365
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:40,346
And somehow,
they're literally...

366
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:43,649
...the bravest...

367
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,651
kindest...

368
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:50,456
...most heroic men
on the planet.

369
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,298
Kids.

370
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,435
They'll always surprise you.

371
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:14,780
Well, how the hell are we
supposed to keep up with Jack

372
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,248
when he's got wings, huh?!

373
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,550
And now he's got Rowena?
He's got the Book of the Damned?

374
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,253
I don't know what to do.
I don't even know where to go!

375
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,993
Cass.
Cass should have told us.

376
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,695
As soon as he saw Jack
go all Dahmer

377
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,998
on his stupid freakin' snake,
he should have told us.

378
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,167
Dean, it wasn't just Cass.

379
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:38,470
It wasn't.

380
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,640
We knew Jack was dangerous.
We always knew.

381
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,145
Long before he killed Michael.
You more than anyone.

382
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:49,114
I mean, from the very
beginning, you knew.

383
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,949
But, you know, we fell for him

384
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:54,219
'cause he had a good heart
and a good soul.

385
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,387
Then he didn't.

386
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,490
And that's on me, too,
by the way.

387
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,627
I mean, I'm the one who made
the call to bring him back.

388
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:03,195
He didn't ask for that.

389
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:06,565
I decided for him.
And you warned me.

390
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,201
No, you didn't know, okay?
We didn't know.

391
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:11,236
Exactly.
We didn't know.

392
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:15,207
But...
He had become our family.

393
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,915
You know, after Maggie

394
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:27,286
and the other Hunters died...

395
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:30,055
I just left.

396
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,859
Just...

397
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,595
dumped Jack on Cass and left.

398
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,869
I knew. I mean,
I knew something...

399
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:47,506
was gonna...

400
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:49,675
I just didn't know it'd be this.

401
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:57,449
I did it, too.

402
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:02,688
When I talked to Donatello
about Jack,

403
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:06,425
he said he was good
as far as he could tell.

404
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,627
But then he talked
about how powerful Jack was

405
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:13,198
and that he could never
really be sure.

406
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:16,101
And it was a warning.

407
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:21,607
I just couldn't see it.

408
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:29,581
Are you done yet?

409
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,416
I said they were
simple ingredients,

410
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,784
but there are a lot of them,

411
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,187
and they need to be
compounded precisely.

412
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:44,296
You know, I could have
fought you back at my flat.

413
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:48,033
I'm not saying I would have won,
but I could have tried.

414
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,802
I didn't because
you want the same thing

415
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:53,605
the boys want, that I want.

416
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:59,244
No offense, buddy,
but this is just so sad.

417
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:04,783
Jack?

418
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:09,421
Bringing the witch bitch into
your desperate little plan?

419
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,691
Why? So you can "make things
right" with the Winchesters?

420
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,192
You stop it.

421
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,295
Excuse me?

422
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:21,500
It's... It's fine.
Um...

423
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,902
Just...

424
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:27,139
What do you want?
Forgiveness?

425
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,875
You want gratitude for
bringing Mommy back?

426
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:34,413
Why? So you can call
this dump home again?

427
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:36,315
So you can ease your guilt?

428
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:39,651
But you don't have guilt
anymore, do you, Jack?

429
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,486
Admit it.

430
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,555
You don't feel anything anymore.

431
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,624
Shut up.

432
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,128
Are you okay?

433
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,397
Keep working.

434
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,302
You know this torment
that you're feeling right now?

435
00:28:57,302 --> 00:29:00,572
It's just a reflex.
It's just a habit, man.

436
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,975
It's... It's an echo
from when you actually

437
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,710
could feel something,
when it mattered.

438
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,011
- Mnh-mnh.
- But you know what?

439
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:08,880
The sooner you give up
this little fantasy,

440
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,450
the sooner this phantom pain
can go away.

441
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,719
- No. Shut up.
- Mnh-mnh. Not gonna.

442
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:16,555
And you know what, Jack?
It's not gonna work.

443
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:19,891
You know it's not gonna work.

444
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,528
You know it.
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

445
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:31,937
Are you done yet?
Are you done?!

446
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,605
Yes.

447
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,476
We have everything we need.

448
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:38,877
All but the last thing.

449
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,651
The last thing.

450
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:47,119
Her body.

451
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,728
Naomi.

452
00:29:56,728 --> 00:30:00,298
I'm still here,
and I'm not going anywhere,

453
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,235
not until I have a word
with you.

454
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,347
Dumah.

455
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:17,349
- Castiel.
- Where's Naomi?

456
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,584
Well, I'd tell you
it's none of your business,

457
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:23,455
but you already know
it's none of your business.

458
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,693
Why are you here?

459
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:28,860
I'm looking for someone.

460
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,429
Mary Winchester?

461
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:34,066
If that's why you're here,
then you should leave now.

462
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:36,268
Why? There may be a way
to bring her back.

463
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,139
Why would you want to do that?

464
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,741
Because she's gone.

465
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:45,043
She is at peace.

466
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,282
You know, she died painlessly.

467
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,651
Instantly. Completely.

468
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:56,388
She's in Heaven,
a special Heaven.

469
00:30:56,388 --> 00:31:00,592
Mary Winchester is complete.

470
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:07,232
You and the Winchesters
may not be.

471
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:11,436
But she is.

472
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,341
Jack?

473
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,176
I brought you
to the right place.

474
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,579
We have the right ingredients.

475
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:23,148
Where's the body, Jack?

476
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:28,220
- We can do this.
- That's...

477
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,989
You will make it work!

478
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,327
It won't. I can't.

479
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,731
Then I'll do it myself.

480
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,601
You're in no condition.

481
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:45,504
Jack, a cardinal rule
of magic...

482
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:48,640
Disposition affects execution,
and you are spinning!

483
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,515
Whatever you bring back,
it won't be her.

484
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:57,616
Then help me!

485
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:03,555
I won't.

486
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,341
Ugh!

487
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:33,652
Rowena, hey.
We just left your place.

488
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:35,086
Well, I'm back!

489
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:39,991
Listen. Jack is using magic
to try to bring your mom back.

490
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,394
- Can he do that?
- There's no body.

491
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,563
And your boy, he snapped.

492
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:48,900
He's desperate.
Confused, angry.

493
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,402
You have to try to stop him.

494
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:53,004
- Why?
- Necromancy is a delicate art.

495
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:57,175
It's unpredictable
under ideal circumstances.

496
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,544
In his state,
oh, I fear your boy

497
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,513
will bring back
something terrible.

498
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:33,144
Id quod mortuum, nunc oriatur.

499
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:37,415
Hoc quod cecidit,
nunc revertatur.

500
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:42,420
Id quod mortuum, nunc oriatur.

501
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,091
Hoc quod cecidit,
nunc revertatur.

502
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,954
Hoc quod cecidit,

503
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:18,456
nunc revertatur.

504
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:24,029
Orimini.

505
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,563
Ori...

506
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,865
mini.

507
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,337
What the hell?

508
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:34,940
- What are you doing?
- The engine just stopped.

509
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,744
Orimini.

510
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,514
Orimini!

511
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:45,583
Orimini!

512
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,386
Jack.

513
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,743
Jack.

514
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,855
It didn't work.

515
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:30,595
No, no. No.

516
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:37,102
Mom? Mom.

517
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,646
Well, I warned you.

518
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:03,455
It's worse...
Trying and failing.

519
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,226
There's no going back.
You realize that now.

520
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:13,631
Cass, Sam, Dean...

521
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,734
they're never gonna
trust you again.

522
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:22,207
And you know what that means.

523
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:24,142
What?

524
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,513
You can never trust them.

525
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,988
Cass.

526
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:19,030
She's in Heaven.

527
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,538
And she's at peace.

528
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,279
So Naomi told you, huh?

529
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:37,315
Dumah, actually.

530
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,485
So, what? Are you just gonna
take her word for it?

531
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,388
No.

532
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:45,557
No, she let me in.

533
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:55,366
I saw your mother's Heaven,
and she is happy.

534
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,973
She's with John,
and there's no sorrow.

535
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,975
There's no guilt.

536
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:06,144
Just joy.

537
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,485
I talked to Rowena.

538
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:17,522
Um, she said

539
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,825
she thinks that what
Jack brought back...

540
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,530
He just brought back a shell.

541
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:32,070
A body, you know.
That it was empty.

542
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,973
Just a...

543
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:37,342
a replica.

544
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:42,347
"Incapable of holding life."

545
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,053
So, what are we
supposed to do now?

546
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,492
What we always do.
