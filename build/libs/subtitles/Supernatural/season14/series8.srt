1
00:00:00,028 --> 00:00:01,540
Lucifer
stole Jack's grace.

2
00:00:01,541 --> 00:00:03,776
I know this must be
so hard without your grace,

3
00:00:03,777 --> 00:00:04,810
but you can get past this.

4
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:08,830
Jack?!

5
00:00:10,367 --> 00:00:11,783
Lily Sunder.

6
00:00:11,785 --> 00:00:14,486
She was a professor
of Apocalyptic Literature.

7
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:16,655
All my life,
I dreamed about angels.

8
00:00:16,657 --> 00:00:18,006
I had a life,

9
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:19,791
a wonderful life.

10
00:00:19,793 --> 00:00:21,826
They took everything from me.

11
00:00:21,828 --> 00:00:25,547
No!

12
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:28,383
Ishim said you made
some kind of pact,

13
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:29,968
that you're using
dark magic.

14
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,303
I use their magic.

15
00:00:31,643 --> 00:00:33,643
Every time I use
one of their spells,

16
00:00:33,645 --> 00:00:36,729
a piece of my soul burns away.

17
00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:38,314
It's all right, Jack.

18
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:39,682
Jack, hey, we're
right here, buddy.

19
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:41,017
He's in good hands.
Don't worry.

20
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:43,019
Jack's in total
systemic failure.

21
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:45,354
His body's in the process
of shutting down.

22
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:47,189
When Jack's grace
was taken from him,

23
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:49,158
his being fell into chaos.

24
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,828
The -- The cells
are gobbling each other up.

25
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,362
Jack is part archangel.

26
00:00:53,364 --> 00:00:55,415
He needs
a much stronger force

27
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:57,884
and probably
some kind of magic,

28
00:00:57,886 --> 00:01:00,536
and he needs it quick.

29
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,673
- Jack.
- Jack!

30
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:05,842
So, what can we do?

31
00:01:05,844 --> 00:01:06,843
Watch over him.

32
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:08,394
Stay by his side...

33
00:01:08,396 --> 00:01:10,179
as he dies.

34
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:21,357
Hey, hey, hey,
it's all right.

35
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,692
Take -- Take it easy.
Take it easy.

36
00:01:22,694 --> 00:01:23,910
It's all right.
It's all right.

37
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:31,734
Please don't be sad.

38
00:01:31,736 --> 00:01:37,123
Maybe -- Maybe this is how
things are supposed to be.

39
00:01:38,426 --> 00:01:41,627
Don't give me that
"meant to be" crap.

40
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:43,296
This isn't part
of some damn plan.

41
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:44,430
Dean...

42
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:14,160
Can you tell him...

43
00:02:14,162 --> 00:02:18,614
it's okay?

44
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,967
Tell him yourself.

45
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:23,002
He'll be back in a minute.

46
00:02:25,507 --> 00:02:27,140
Sam...

47
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,461
...what happens next...

48
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:34,981
for someone like me?

49
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:38,651
I don't know.

50
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:45,441
Then it's gonna be
an adventure.

51
00:02:57,005 --> 00:02:58,621
Dean.

52
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:01,707
I can't.

53
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:06,712
It's not right,
Cass, you know?

54
00:03:06,714 --> 00:03:08,497
It's just -- It's not --

55
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:10,133
What?

56
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:11,768
It's not fair?

57
00:03:13,221 --> 00:03:14,854
I know that.

58
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:16,973
But he needs you.

59
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:33,990
He's gone.

Maybe we should...start
thinking about next steps.

63
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:20,253
Wake and a bonfire,
Hunter style.

64
00:04:20,255 --> 00:04:22,371
It's what Jack would've wanted.

65
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:29,045
Sam,
your brother's in pain.

66
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:31,797
Just let him be.

67
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:34,267
If he needs his space,
we're gonna give it to him.

69
00:04:46,114 --> 00:04:48,731
<i>You know the drill.</i>

70
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,599
Hey, Mom, it's me.

71
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:55,621
Sorry to lay this
on your voicemail, but, uh...

72
00:04:55,623 --> 00:04:56,906
it's Jack.

73
00:04:56,908 --> 00:04:58,491
He...

74
00:04:58,493 --> 00:05:02,444
He got sick, um,

75
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:05,081
and he, uh -- h-he died...

76
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,133
this morning.

77
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:09,285
I would have called you sooner,
but, um, it --

78
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:12,454
it happened so fast.

79
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:17,293
And we thought we could fix it,
you know like always.

80
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:19,645
Anyway, Mom, I'm sorry.

81
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:23,799
I know how much he meant to you
and, uh, to all of us.

82
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:26,018
Anyway,
to tell you the truth,

83
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,304
it would really be nice
to hear your voice.

84
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:30,606
If you could, uh,
just call us back.

85
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:07,109
Hey, you seen Sam?

86
00:06:13,651 --> 00:06:15,517
How could you just
let him leave, man?

87
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,570
You saw what he was like.

88
00:06:17,572 --> 00:06:19,322
Dean, you said
to give him space.

89
00:06:19,324 --> 00:06:24,210
Yeah, space, in the bunker,
with <i>us,</i> not <i>this.</i>

90
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:25,711
Dean, look.

91
00:06:39,043 --> 00:06:40,726
Tell me
you didn't make a deal.

92
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:42,728
A -- A -- A deal? What?

93
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,779
No.

94
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:46,048
I --

95
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,734
I was trying
to build a pyre.

96
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:28,924
I couldn't -- I-I couldn't
even do that for him.

97
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:33,279
I should've done more.

98
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:34,814
- Sam --
- I should have tried harder.

99
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:37,450
You know, I mean,
everything we got --

100
00:07:37,452 --> 00:07:40,403
the spells, the lore --

101
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:43,072
what good is any of it
if we couldn't even save him?

102
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:45,207
At least you were
there for him.

103
00:07:47,778 --> 00:07:51,414
This doesn't feel right.

104
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,967
It's just not how I thought
Jack's story would end.

105
00:07:56,421 --> 00:08:00,306
Yeah. None of us did.

106
00:08:00,308 --> 00:08:04,260
The certainty...of death,

107
00:08:04,262 --> 00:08:06,429
even for angels,
it's always felt natural,

108
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:09,265
but this doesn't.

109
00:08:11,018 --> 00:08:14,487
Jack being taken
before his time.

110
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:16,822
I mean, taken before me.

111
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,160
So, what do we do?

112
00:08:21,162 --> 00:08:22,778
Say goodbye...

113
00:08:24,782 --> 00:08:27,333
...tomorrow.

114
00:08:27,335 --> 00:08:29,668
Tonight...

115
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,171
we get loaded.

116
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,049
? Take one last look ?

117
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,472
? Before you leave ?

118
00:08:49,474 --> 00:08:52,308
? 'Cause, oh, somehow ?

119
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,862
? It means so much to me ?

120
00:08:56,864 --> 00:09:02,067
? And if you ever need me,
you know where I'll be ?

121
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:05,538
? So please call home ?

122
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,658
? If you change your mind ?

123
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:16,031
? Oh, I don't mind ?

124
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:21,554
? So go on ?

125
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:22,588
Ohh.

126
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,342
? I won't say no more ?

127
00:09:26,344 --> 00:09:27,560
For Jack!

128
00:09:27,562 --> 00:09:28,894
? My heart ain't in it ?

129
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:31,597
? But I'll hold the door ?

130
00:09:34,735 --> 00:09:40,072
? But just remember
what I said before ?

131
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:43,242
? Please call home ?

132
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:48,697
? If you change your mind ?

133
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:57,590
We did everything
we could, right?

134
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:18,594
Here's to you, Jack...

135
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:22,231
wherever you are.

136
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:29,455
Jack, take it easy.

137
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:31,574
You don't have to cram it
all in at once, right?

138
00:10:31,576 --> 00:10:32,908
Still no signal.

139
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,411
Yeah, 'cause I told you,
that app blows.

140
00:10:35,413 --> 00:10:36,996
I found this
in the glove compartment.

141
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:39,131
Ah! Old school!

142
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:40,583
A real map.

143
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:42,251
Let's find our way
to Dodge City.

144
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:45,087
C'mere, Jack. I'm gonna
teach you how to read a map.

145
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:48,424
So, rule number one --
rule number one --

146
00:10:48,426 --> 00:10:49,425
rule number one --

147
00:10:49,427 --> 00:10:50,459
Dean?

148
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:52,428
North is usually up.

149
00:10:58,636 --> 00:11:01,604
Something's wrong.

150
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:40,384
Man, haven't seen
this stuff in years.

151
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:43,353
And what language
is this technically in?

152
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:44,888
We're not sure, but it's --

153
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,190
it's written in cuneiform.

154
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:48,141
Kevin was very thorough.

155
00:11:48,143 --> 00:11:51,178
Yeah. We kept it all --
the translations,

156
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,980
his notes on his translations,
annotations.

157
00:11:52,982 --> 00:11:54,147
You name it.

158
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:56,884
Ohh. Whoa, ohh.

159
00:11:56,886 --> 00:11:58,585
Is this it?

160
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:01,355
Uh, yeah,
this is everything.

161
00:12:01,357 --> 00:12:02,556
You think it's possible?

162
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:03,657
I think so. Maybe.

163
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:05,459
Maybe what?

164
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:08,562
Hello, Dean.

165
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:11,498
Dean,
you remember Lily Sunder.

166
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,532
L--

167
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:17,271
You got old.

168
00:12:17,273 --> 00:12:19,873
Did I?

169
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:24,711
An unfortunate side effect
of giving up magic, I suppose.

170
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:27,547
Ah.
What are you doing here?

171
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:30,050
- I called her.
- You --

172
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:34,922
Okay. Last thing
I remember

173
00:12:34,924 --> 00:12:37,891
was her killing
a whole bunch of angels

174
00:12:37,893 --> 00:12:39,126
to get revenge
for her daughter.

175
00:12:39,128 --> 00:12:40,394
She tried to kill you.

176
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:42,195
- Yeah. I remember.
- That's not --

177
00:12:42,197 --> 00:12:44,464
Dean, listen, last night,

178
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:47,868
after about whiskey number five,
it hit me.

179
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,203
I mean,
we've torn through all the lore

180
00:12:50,205 --> 00:12:52,105
looking for a way
to cure Jack, right?

181
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:54,074
But we've never looked through

182
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:56,076
Kevin's angel tablet
translations.

183
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:58,245
Yeah,
'cause they're worthless.

184
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:00,447
I mean, Kevin translated
them into --

185
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:03,467
to crazy scribble
only a prophet can read.

186
00:13:03,469 --> 00:13:07,420
And last I checked, we can't
exactly ask Donatello.

187
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:10,440
Maybe I can read them.

188
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:11,775
Oh, so, what,
now you're a prophet?

189
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:13,610
She's the next
best thing.

190
00:13:13,612 --> 00:13:16,096
I mean, Lily is an angel expert
who tapped into their magic

191
00:13:16,098 --> 00:13:18,065
in ways we didn't even
know existed.

192
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:19,483
So, if she can read
the translations,

193
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:21,267
then maybe we can
pull off a miracle.

194
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:23,320
What kind of miracle?

195
00:13:23,322 --> 00:13:26,823
A way to bring Jack home.

196
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:29,576
Okay. Go for it.

197
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:37,968
So, can you read --

198
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,219
Shh!

199
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:46,977
I'm sorry. I can't.

200
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:49,179
Oh. All right.
Well, thanks for stopping by.

201
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:51,481
Wait.

202
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:52,766
You can use my magic.

203
00:13:52,768 --> 00:13:54,267
Your magic?

204
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:56,937
The magic I used,
as you so sensitively put it,

205
00:13:56,939 --> 00:13:59,439
to get revenge
for my daughter.

206
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:02,826
You said your nephilim boy --
Jack --

207
00:14:02,828 --> 00:14:06,446
without his angel grace,
his human body died?

208
00:14:06,448 --> 00:14:10,150
My magic draws power
from the soul, the human soul.

209
00:14:10,152 --> 00:14:11,317
It could save him.

210
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:13,036
You'd give your soul up?

211
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:15,321
Not <i>my</i> soul.
<i>His.</i>

212
00:14:15,323 --> 00:14:16,873
Pass.

213
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:20,293
It's not his entire soul,
obviously.

214
00:14:20,295 --> 00:14:22,462
How much of it?

215
00:14:22,464 --> 00:14:24,548
As long
as he's only using it

216
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,300
to sustain his body,
it won't cost much.

217
00:14:27,302 --> 00:14:28,385
He'll never miss it.

218
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:30,053
What are we even
talking about?

219
00:14:30,055 --> 00:14:33,006
I-It's too late.
Jack's dead.

220
00:14:33,008 --> 00:14:34,808
His soul's gone, right?

221
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,728
Maybe not.
If Jack is in Heaven,

222
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,565
I might be able to pull
his soul into his body.

223
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:45,035
It would only be
for a few seconds.

224
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:46,486
That's all the time
I need.

225
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:48,238
If I can open the door,

226
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,526
your boy can use my magic
to stay alive.

227
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:55,662
Resurrection and a cure.

228
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,498
You're welcome.

229
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,051
And you would do
all this for us, huh?

230
00:15:01,053 --> 00:15:04,254
Eh, for what? Out of
the kindness of your heart?

231
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:06,539
No. But I'm willing
to trade.

232
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,724
Trade for what?

233
00:15:07,726 --> 00:15:10,343
I'm old, and I'm dying.

234
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:12,712
And when my life is over,

235
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:15,715
I'm pretty certain
I'm going to Hell.

236
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:17,684
Why is that?

237
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:20,053
Well, I murdered
a lot of angels.

238
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:23,723
I don't expect them
to welcome me with open arms.

239
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:27,661
So, if you want my help...

240
00:15:28,897 --> 00:15:30,997
...get me into Heaven.

241
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:35,902
We're talking about
that kid's soul.

242
00:15:35,904 --> 00:15:37,037
Not all of it.

243
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,288
Oh, okay, then.

244
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,906
Tell me you're
not cool with this.

245
00:15:39,908 --> 00:15:41,741
Don't you think Jack should
decide for himself?

246
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:44,428
Listen, I know
how important a soul is.

247
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,213
Believe me. I do.

248
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:47,764
But if we have a shot at saving
him and bringing him --

249
00:15:47,766 --> 00:15:50,717
Look, if we do this --
<i>if</i> --

250
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:53,086
how are we supposed to
get her upstairs, hmm?

251
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:54,888
What, do we talk to Death?
Billie?

252
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,389
Kidnap a reaper?

253
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:59,226
Death is powerful,
but she and her reapers --

254
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:01,594
they don't decide
who goes up or who goes down.

255
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:02,696
Then who does?

256
00:16:04,099 --> 00:16:06,733
Anubis.
Guardian of the Dead.

257
00:16:06,735 --> 00:16:09,602
The Ancient Egyptians
believed that when you die,

258
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:12,438
Anubis would weigh your heart
on his scale

259
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,107
against justice's feather.

260
00:16:14,109 --> 00:16:15,492
Yeah, the -- the weighing
of the heart ceremony, right,

261
00:16:15,494 --> 00:16:16,609
but that wasn't Anubis.

262
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:18,128
That was Osiris.
We met him.

263
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,112
Major dick.

264
00:16:19,114 --> 00:16:20,797
Osiris is Anubis's father,

265
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,615
and Heaven passed over him
when they enlisted his son.

266
00:16:22,617 --> 00:16:24,501
Anubis works for Heaven?

267
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:26,119
He doesn't work <i>for</i> Heaven.
He works <i>with</i> Heaven.

268
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:28,121
When God left --
sorry, long story --

269
00:16:28,123 --> 00:16:29,455
we needed a new judge,

270
00:16:29,457 --> 00:16:31,624
and Anubis was
the obvious choice.

271
00:16:31,626 --> 00:16:33,093
So, Heaven hired a temp

272
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:34,627
to make sure the soul trains
kept running on time?

273
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,680
Right. Great.
So, we summon him.

274
00:16:36,682 --> 00:16:38,598
You can do that?
You can summon a god?

275
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,268
Done it before.

276
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:48,641
Here, boy! Here, boy!

277
00:16:48,643 --> 00:16:49,642
Go long!

278
00:16:57,703 --> 00:17:01,338
Roosevelt!

279
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,673
Who are you?

280
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:22,809
I'm Jack.

281
00:17:25,697 --> 00:17:28,532
I'm your son.

282
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:37,324
My...

283
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:42,362
Jack.

284
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:43,580
It's you.

285
00:17:47,085 --> 00:17:49,169
Oh.

286
00:17:49,171 --> 00:17:52,422
I don't understand.

287
00:17:52,424 --> 00:17:54,874
You were just a baby.

288
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:56,542
I-I grew up.

289
00:17:58,564 --> 00:18:01,097
Do you know
where you are?

290
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:02,882
Uh...

291
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:05,735
Roosevelt?

292
00:18:05,737 --> 00:18:09,105
He was hit by a car
when I was in high school.

293
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:12,058
How in the world...

294
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,111
You're in Heaven.

295
00:18:15,113 --> 00:18:17,747
You're in your memories,

296
00:18:17,749 --> 00:18:21,234
your best,
best memories because...

297
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:24,070
I died.

298
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:26,039
The day you were born.

299
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:34,097
Why are you...

300
00:18:39,754 --> 00:18:42,755
No.

301
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:44,090
No, no, no.

302
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:45,108
Baby, no, no.

303
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,443
Castiel -- he was --

304
00:18:46,445 --> 00:18:47,894
he was supposed to
take care of you.

305
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:49,095
And he did.

306
00:18:49,097 --> 00:18:52,115
He and --
and Sam and Dean --

307
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:54,301
they tried their best.

308
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:57,804
But things didn't go
as planned.

309
00:18:59,441 --> 00:19:02,509
That's why I had to see
if you were okay.

310
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:04,611
Jack, what's wrong?

311
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:08,798
All right, Lily
should be done in a second.

312
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,452
She's writing instructions for
Jack so he'll know how to, uh...

313
00:19:12,454 --> 00:19:15,839
Use the soul-sucking magic?
Boy, that lady's a peach.

314
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:18,008
- Listen, we talked about this.
- I know.

315
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,094
Gotta happen.
It's the only way. Right.

316
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:22,429
But I don't like
rollin' the dice

317
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:24,297
on the word
of a psycho ex-angel killer.

318
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:27,100
I don't love it, either,
but taking risks,

319
00:19:27,102 --> 00:19:28,968
making crappy deals --
that's what we do.

320
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,270
Yeah, and they usually
bite us in the ass.

321
00:19:30,272 --> 00:19:31,521
So, what do you
want to do about it?

322
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:33,139
Leave Jack in the morgue?
Burn him?

323
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:34,491
I didn't say that.

324
00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:36,026
Because, for me,
not doing this -- that --

325
00:19:36,028 --> 00:19:38,278
that would be like letting him
die all over again.

326
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,946
I want Jack back,
too, okay?

327
00:19:39,948 --> 00:19:41,314
I do.

328
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:42,782
I just don't trust Lily.

329
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:47,787
You got a 20 on Jack?

330
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,172
Not exactly.

331
00:19:49,174 --> 00:19:53,293
Angel radio is playing
a distress signal.

332
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:54,544
Awesome.

333
00:19:54,546 --> 00:19:55,828
All of Heaven's gates
are open,

334
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,663
even the ones
that Metatron closed.

335
00:19:57,665 --> 00:19:58,831
What could that mean?

336
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,334
I don't know,
but it's not good.

337
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:03,186
More awesome.

338
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:06,022
All right, well, you go.
We got Lily.

339
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:07,640
When we're ready,
we'll pray.

340
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:28,694
The instruction manual.

341
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:30,830
Thanks.

342
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:32,882
All right,
we're almost set.

343
00:20:32,884 --> 00:20:33,917
Just got to get
one more thing.

344
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,052
I'm gonna go grab it.

345
00:20:37,005 --> 00:20:38,722
Hey.

346
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:53,737
You know, maybe we
got off to a bad start.

347
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:56,722
Um, guess I should be
thanking you.

348
00:20:56,724 --> 00:20:58,992
Apology accepted.

349
00:21:01,613 --> 00:21:04,897
Except something's
been bothering me.

350
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:06,732
Uh, you know,

351
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:11,087
if this magic of yours
is so great...

352
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:13,590
why'd you stop using it?

353
00:21:16,461 --> 00:21:18,428
You're letting yourself
get old.

354
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:24,083
You're letting yourself
die.

355
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:25,635
Why?

356
00:21:25,637 --> 00:21:28,304
Why risk going to Hell
if you don't have to?

357
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:30,723
There's something
you're not tellin' us.

358
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:36,563
When Ishim
took my daughter,

359
00:21:36,565 --> 00:21:39,399
I swore I'd kill him,

360
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:44,120
even if it meant
burning my entire soul.

361
00:21:44,122 --> 00:21:45,955
But it didn't.

362
00:21:47,492 --> 00:21:51,944
I have a sliver,
a whisper of my soul left.

363
00:21:51,946 --> 00:21:53,830
And?

364
00:21:53,832 --> 00:21:56,282
May --

365
00:21:56,284 --> 00:21:58,334
my daughter,
my little girl --

366
00:21:58,336 --> 00:21:59,952
is in Heaven.

367
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:01,454
And if there is still

368
00:22:01,456 --> 00:22:03,473
a piece of my soul...

369
00:22:05,594 --> 00:22:08,595
Now do you understand?

370
00:22:10,632 --> 00:22:12,232
Hello?

371
00:22:14,135 --> 00:22:16,102
Hello?

372
00:22:28,904 --> 00:22:30,371
Zuriel.

373
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:40,081
Dumah.

374
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,083
Castiel.

375
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:44,135
What happened?

376
00:22:44,137 --> 00:22:45,436
I don't know.

377
00:22:45,438 --> 00:22:48,473
We were just -- Sorry.

378
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:53,311
That stuff --
when it touched me,

379
00:22:53,313 --> 00:22:55,697
everything
just went black.

380
00:22:57,484 --> 00:23:00,068
I thought you were
supposed to be on Earth.

381
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,287
I'm looking for someone.

382
00:23:04,157 --> 00:23:06,107
Jack.

383
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:08,943
I have to find him.

384
00:23:08,945 --> 00:23:10,461
Don't leave me.

385
00:23:12,782 --> 00:23:14,249
Can you walk?

386
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:17,969
Dumah.

387
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:34,269
It's cold.

388
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:36,154
He's not here.

389
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:40,158
Hello, Castiel, Dumah.

390
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:42,694
Jack's gone.

391
00:23:42,696 --> 00:23:43,945
How is that possible?

392
00:23:43,947 --> 00:23:45,313
Perhaps the angel
side of him

393
00:23:45,315 --> 00:23:47,148
knew he was in Heaven.

394
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,533
In any case, he left.

395
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:50,451
Naomi,
what is happening here?

396
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:52,704
We're under attack.

397
00:23:52,706 --> 00:23:55,456
It stormed the gates.
It defeated our defenses.

398
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,792
There are so few of us left,
we couldn't even stop it.

399
00:23:57,794 --> 00:23:59,827
It? What --
What do you mean by "it"?

400
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:02,997
The shadow, the thing
that rules the Empty.

401
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:06,050
I'm surprised you didn't
recognize its handiwork,

402
00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:07,335
Castiel.

403
00:24:07,337 --> 00:24:09,137
I thought
you were old friends.

404
00:24:11,024 --> 00:24:12,523
What is this place?

405
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:15,059
<i>Nothing but Empty.</i>

406
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:18,396
<i>Angels and demons, you all</i>
<i>come here when you die.</i>

407
00:24:18,398 --> 00:24:19,897
How did you know?

408
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:23,151
You're the only one of us
who ever escaped.

409
00:24:23,153 --> 00:24:24,819
What does it want?

410
00:24:24,821 --> 00:24:26,654
The boy.

411
00:24:26,656 --> 00:24:29,324
The Empty considers
Jack its property.

412
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:31,159
And who knows?
Maybe it's right.

413
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:32,693
He is half-angel.

414
00:24:32,695 --> 00:24:34,028
So, what do we do?

415
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,046
Give it what it wants.

416
00:24:35,048 --> 00:24:36,364
You're joking.

417
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:39,050
Tell me --
what choice do we have?

418
00:24:39,052 --> 00:24:41,502
If we don't meet its demands,
Heaven will fall.

419
00:24:41,504 --> 00:24:46,974
46,750,000,000 human souls
will be cast in the wind.

420
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:51,346
What's one nephilim boy
against all that?

421
00:24:54,184 --> 00:24:56,217
You know I'm right,
Castiel.

422
00:24:56,219 --> 00:24:58,436
This is what we have to do.

423
00:24:58,438 --> 00:25:00,772
Help me.

424
00:25:05,745 --> 00:25:08,279
No.
Castiel --

425
00:25:10,116 --> 00:25:11,232
Naomi?

426
00:25:11,234 --> 00:25:13,918
Castiel, run!

427
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,255
Ya 'anubays,
yda 'uwzuris.

428
00:25:17,257 --> 00:25:19,573
Astamae 'iilaa suti.iel, run!

429
00:25:19,575 --> 00:25:23,544
Ya 'Anubis,
'ant min yazan alqulbu.

430
00:25:23,546 --> 00:25:26,597
Astamae 'iilaa suti.

431
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:29,884
Ya 'Anubis,
dalil almawtaa.

432
00:25:29,886 --> 00:25:34,305
Aleawalim bayn
alealamin maftuhatan,

433
00:25:34,307 --> 00:25:36,924
wa'amrak 'an tuqadim

434
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:39,827
nafsak fi eini.

435
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:44,832
Give it a second.

436
00:25:52,642 --> 00:25:55,410
Mm.
The brothers Winchester.

437
00:25:55,412 --> 00:25:57,979
I must say, your files have
come across my desk many times.

438
00:25:57,981 --> 00:25:59,781
We never met?
I mean, we've died.

439
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:01,315
Yeah. A lot.

440
00:26:01,317 --> 00:26:02,917
I'm more of a "back of
the house" kind of guy.

441
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:05,286
Death and her subordinates
get all the face time.

442
00:26:05,288 --> 00:26:06,954
I get stuck with
the paperwork.

443
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:08,756
Pushin' pencils,
damning souls.

444
00:26:08,758 --> 00:26:09,791
Tough work.

445
00:26:11,294 --> 00:26:14,595
Just as snappy
as advertised.

446
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:16,597
What do you want?

447
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,032
It's me.

448
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:20,368
I need to know where
I'm going when I die.

449
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,703
Hmm.

450
00:26:22,705 --> 00:26:24,972
That's unorthodox.

451
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:27,875
Against protocol.

452
00:26:30,113 --> 00:26:32,447
But I suppose
we're already here.

453
00:26:36,536 --> 00:26:37,985
An abacus?

454
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:40,505
You were expecting
a scale and a feather?

455
00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:42,039
May I?

456
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:04,145
I'm sorry.

457
00:27:04,147 --> 00:27:05,396
No.

458
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:07,181
Change it.

459
00:27:07,183 --> 00:27:08,682
I can't.

460
00:27:08,684 --> 00:27:10,034
Well, looks like
you're not goin' anywhere.

461
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:11,685
Yeah. The lore
was pretty clear --

462
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:14,705
Anubis can be bound in
a ring of foinik?laio.

463
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:17,492
Aka palm oil.

464
00:27:17,494 --> 00:27:19,744
Just so happens
we had some laying around.

465
00:27:19,746 --> 00:27:21,362
This is a miscalculation.

466
00:27:21,364 --> 00:27:24,048
Fine. Then change it.
Let her into Heaven.

467
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,917
I'm an accountant.

468
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,251
I don't have
that kind of power.

469
00:27:27,253 --> 00:27:28,553
Yeah, right.
Like you or --

470
00:27:28,555 --> 00:27:29,837
or God has never
made an exception?

471
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,005
That's right.

472
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:32,924
Because <i>God</i> doesn't decide.

473
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:34,091
<i>I</i> don't decide.

474
00:27:34,093 --> 00:27:36,594
<i>You</i> do, each of you,

475
00:27:36,596 --> 00:27:39,096
your individual choices
all tallied up

476
00:27:39,098 --> 00:27:40,731
at the precise moment
of your death.

477
00:27:46,722 --> 00:27:48,189
Keep me here.

478
00:27:48,191 --> 00:27:49,890
Try and kill me.

479
00:27:49,892 --> 00:27:52,109
It is not going to change
Lily Sunder's fate.

480
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,696
But it might change yours.

481
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:07,375
Smart boy.

482
00:28:23,226 --> 00:28:25,593
You're sure?

483
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:28,396
I know him.

484
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:30,815
He's here.

485
00:28:36,573 --> 00:28:37,989
See anything?

486
00:28:37,991 --> 00:28:40,458
Whatever comes through
that door,

487
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,376
I'll distract it
so you can run.

488
00:28:44,747 --> 00:28:47,615
I'm not going anywhere.

489
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:48,949
Jack?

490
00:28:48,951 --> 00:28:50,301
Cass?

491
00:29:10,273 --> 00:29:12,189
Hello, Castiel.

492
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:14,442
Kelly.

493
00:29:18,981 --> 00:29:20,948
I'm so sorry.

494
00:29:24,787 --> 00:29:26,654
I failed you.

495
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,838
You didn't.

496
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:30,824
You didn't.

497
00:29:30,826 --> 00:29:35,713
Jack -- he's wonderful.

498
00:29:35,715 --> 00:29:38,132
Yeah.

499
00:29:38,134 --> 00:29:41,302
We've been getting
to know each other.

500
00:29:41,304 --> 00:29:42,836
What are you doing here?

501
00:29:42,838 --> 00:29:46,807
Sam and Dean and I -- we
found a way to bring you home.

502
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:52,146
So, I'll be alive again?

503
00:29:52,148 --> 00:29:56,033
Yeah. But to do so,
we -- we need to use magic

504
00:29:56,035 --> 00:29:57,702
that will draw
on your soul.

505
00:29:57,704 --> 00:29:58,869
W-What do you mean,
my soul?

506
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:00,521
It'll be just
a small piece.

507
00:30:00,523 --> 00:30:03,574
And I know it's too much to
ask, but it's the only way.

508
00:30:03,576 --> 00:30:04,992
No. I-I don't know.

509
00:30:04,994 --> 00:30:08,746
It's not just Jack's life
that's at stake.

510
00:30:08,748 --> 00:30:09,914
It --

511
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:12,717
The Empty
has invaded Heaven

512
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:15,586
because it wants you.

513
00:30:15,588 --> 00:30:17,171
Why him?

514
00:30:17,173 --> 00:30:18,706
Because Jack
is half-angel,

515
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:21,175
and we angels -- when we die,
we go to another place.

516
00:30:21,177 --> 00:30:25,012
It's a place that's
just endless nothing.

517
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:27,214
And this entity --

518
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:28,882
it won't stop
until it finds you,

519
00:30:28,884 --> 00:30:31,936
but if you're not here,
if you're alive...

520
00:30:31,938 --> 00:30:33,554
Then it'll leave Heaven.

521
00:30:33,556 --> 00:30:36,073
Smart.

522
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:37,575
Dumah.

523
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:40,695
Try again.

524
00:30:58,078 --> 00:30:59,511
Lily, I --
I know you're upset,

525
00:30:59,513 --> 00:31:02,247
but you can still
do the spell.

526
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:06,518
That wasn't the deal.

527
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,886
I've got to go.

528
00:31:07,888 --> 00:31:09,187
We have nothing
to offer you, noth--

529
00:31:09,189 --> 00:31:10,688
nothing to say, but...

530
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,857
He's <i>our</i> kid!

531
00:31:12,859 --> 00:31:14,609
I'm sorry.

532
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,946
You know what I think?

533
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:23,401
Burning all that soul?

534
00:31:23,403 --> 00:31:26,037
You're not even human
anymore, not really.

535
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,238
Dean --

536
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,008
Otherwise,
how could you ever,

537
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:35,597
ever let anyone go through
what you went through?

538
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:37,765
The pain of losing a kid?

539
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:40,134
Don't do this to us.

540
00:31:44,757 --> 00:31:46,391
You're the Empty.

541
00:31:46,393 --> 00:31:48,476
Pretty good, huh?

542
00:31:48,478 --> 00:31:49,760
You ready to go?

543
00:31:49,762 --> 00:31:51,596
You stay away from him.

544
00:31:52,732 --> 00:31:54,315
Castiel,
you know how this goes --

545
00:31:54,317 --> 00:31:56,451
the good souls here,
the bad souls there.

546
00:31:56,453 --> 00:31:58,820
The angels are mine.

547
00:31:58,822 --> 00:32:00,622
Enough.
Stop interrupting!

548
00:32:03,276 --> 00:32:04,792
Start paying attention.

549
00:32:06,913 --> 00:32:08,463
I'm taking him.

550
00:32:10,116 --> 00:32:14,168
And where I'm taking you
is worse than Hell...

551
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,754
because at least Hell
is something.

552
00:32:18,308 --> 00:32:19,457
Ohh.

553
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:21,959
Ohh, God,
they look scared.

554
00:32:23,263 --> 00:32:25,480
Does that hurt you?

555
00:32:28,985 --> 00:32:30,685
Good...

556
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:32,770
because I want it to.

557
00:32:36,526 --> 00:32:37,492
Ugh!

558
00:33:01,217 --> 00:33:03,301
I'm ready.

559
00:33:06,056 --> 00:33:07,722
No!

560
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:09,140
Stop!

561
00:33:09,142 --> 00:33:11,059
Oh!

562
00:33:12,195 --> 00:33:14,512
Cass,
I hope you can hear me.

563
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:15,863
We've got Jack.

564
00:33:15,865 --> 00:33:17,532
His shell --
it's ready to go.

565
00:33:17,534 --> 00:33:19,684
Here's hoping that you're
staring at him right now.

566
00:33:19,686 --> 00:33:23,905
So, if you are, then, uh,
do your thing, okay?

567
00:33:23,907 --> 00:33:25,490
Amen.

568
00:33:28,712 --> 00:33:31,996
Oh-doh oh oh-zah-zuhm-ah,

569
00:33:31,998 --> 00:33:34,832
oh-ee, ah-oh-ee-vee...

570
00:33:46,262 --> 00:33:48,513
Take me.

571
00:33:48,515 --> 00:33:50,264
A little louder,
please.

572
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:52,567
Take me in his stead.

573
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:55,353
Take me.

574
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:57,388
You?

575
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:00,241
I'm the one you want.
I'm the one who woke you up.

576
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:09,117
You?

577
00:34:11,087 --> 00:34:13,755
But you're
already mine.

578
00:34:13,757 --> 00:34:15,623
Not for years...

579
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:19,427
eons maybe.

580
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,762
But if you'll agree,
I will go now,

581
00:34:20,764 --> 00:34:23,214
and I will go willingly.

582
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,103
Deal.

583
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,424
Oh, but not now.

584
00:34:33,426 --> 00:34:35,593
No, no, no, no, no.

585
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:38,429
No, you see,
I-I meant what I said.

586
00:34:38,431 --> 00:34:41,616
I-I want you to suffer.

587
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:46,937
I want you to go back to --
to your normal life

588
00:34:46,939 --> 00:34:48,656
and -- and then forget
about this and forget about me.

589
00:34:48,658 --> 00:34:49,957
And -- And then,
when you finally

590
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:52,076
give yourself permission
to be happy

591
00:34:52,078 --> 00:34:55,446
and let the sun shine
on your face,

592
00:34:55,448 --> 00:34:59,133
that's when I'll come.

593
00:34:59,135 --> 00:35:02,970
That's when I'll come
to drag you to nothing.

594
00:35:05,675 --> 00:35:07,675
I accept.

595
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:26,994
Where am I?

596
00:35:26,996 --> 00:35:30,031
Easy. It's all right.

597
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:37,988
Why?
Why did you do that?

598
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,508
Because I made a promise.

599
00:35:42,462 --> 00:35:45,513
Because I love you, Jack.

600
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:48,800
And Sam and Dean --
they love you.

601
00:35:48,802 --> 00:35:52,053
And they are fighting for you
at this very minute.

602
00:35:52,055 --> 00:35:54,472
Oh oh. Oh-doh...

603
00:35:54,474 --> 00:35:56,307
I hope that...

604
00:35:58,678 --> 00:36:01,979
They don't need to know
what happened here.

605
00:36:01,981 --> 00:36:05,817
What I did -- I'm -- I'm --
I'm at peace with my choice.

606
00:36:06,986 --> 00:36:08,653
I don't want them
to worry.

607
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:14,158
I won't tell them.

608
00:36:17,163 --> 00:36:19,330
I promise.

609
00:36:19,332 --> 00:36:21,999
Then we should go.

610
00:36:30,176 --> 00:36:31,876
We didn't get
enough time.

611
00:36:31,878 --> 00:36:34,679
Shh. It's okay.

612
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:36,380
Go.

613
00:36:36,382 --> 00:36:39,550
Have a great life.

614
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,019
I'll be waiting.

615
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:50,611
I love you so much.

616
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:05,209
You ready?

617
00:37:28,148 --> 00:37:29,781
Jack.

618
00:37:29,783 --> 00:37:31,066
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

619
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:32,818
Read this.
Jack, read this.

620
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,788
Oh, koh-nuh-ga-ma-
fuh-luh-guh,

621
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,740
ah-oh-ee-vee-ah-ee...

622
00:37:38,742 --> 00:37:40,242
...ee-duh-luh-vah...

623
00:37:40,244 --> 00:37:42,411
oh-ee-vee-ah-ee,

624
00:37:42,413 --> 00:37:44,279
ee-duh-luh-vah-juh-ah-um

625
00:37:44,281 --> 00:37:47,749
kah-dah.

626
00:37:57,077 --> 00:37:58,910
Was that my soul?

627
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,379
How do you feel?

628
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:02,464
Good.

629
00:38:02,466 --> 00:38:05,384
I feel...good.

630
00:38:11,025 --> 00:38:12,474
It's good to have
you back.

631
00:38:13,777 --> 00:38:14,893
Lily, thank you.

632
00:38:14,895 --> 00:38:18,230
Yeah. Lily --

633
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:23,785
Lily?

634
00:38:47,428 --> 00:38:50,662
I don't understand.
Why am I here?

635
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:53,098
Hm.

636
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:01,973
Care to try
your luck again?

637
00:39:27,017 --> 00:39:28,717
I'm curious.

638
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:31,136
Did you know what doing
the spell would cost you?

639
00:39:35,642 --> 00:39:37,893
Say hello to
your daughter for me.

640
00:39:46,236 --> 00:39:48,653
Hello, Castiel.

641
00:39:50,574 --> 00:39:52,407
Relax.

642
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:55,794
I'm here to thank you.

643
00:39:58,048 --> 00:39:59,748
What you did --

644
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,552
I know it wasn't
for our benefit...

645
00:40:03,554 --> 00:40:05,387
but you saved us.

646
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,260
You're welcome.

647
00:40:12,262 --> 00:40:15,764
I think that deserves
a reward, don't you?

648
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:19,384
Like, for example,

649
00:40:19,386 --> 00:40:22,187
the archangel Michael's
location.

650
00:40:23,557 --> 00:40:25,407
You know where he is?

651
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:27,725
We have an idea.

652
00:40:27,727 --> 00:40:30,529
And word is,
you've been looking for him.

653
00:40:47,798 --> 00:40:50,215
Is, uh, something wrong?

654
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:52,434
No.

655
00:40:52,436 --> 00:40:54,586
No, not at all.

656
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:55,887
Just damn glad
to have you back.

657
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:56,888
Yeah.

658
00:40:58,425 --> 00:41:01,226
And we know
where Michael is.

659
00:41:01,228 --> 00:41:03,228
Not quite sure how
you pulled that one off.

660
00:41:05,065 --> 00:41:06,648
Well, we, uh --

661
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:10,435
we still don't know where
Dark Kaia is or the spear.

662
00:41:10,437 --> 00:41:12,988
Yeah, but we will.
We'll figure it out.

663
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,990
We'll find her.
I mean, we found her before.

664
00:41:14,992 --> 00:41:16,825
That's right.

665
00:41:16,827 --> 00:41:18,493
And then Michael --

666
00:41:18,495 --> 00:41:20,662
and that son of a bitch
is gonna pay.

667
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:23,615
Come on.
