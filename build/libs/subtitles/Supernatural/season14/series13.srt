1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,417
Dad's on a Hunting trip,

2
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:03,206
and he hasn't been home
in a few days.

3
00:00:03,207 --> 00:00:04,473
We got work to do.

4
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:08,544
That door is giving.
I can feel it giving.

5
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:16,485
I know once you go Casper,
things can be a little --

6
00:00:16,487 --> 00:00:18,454
well, a lot crazy.

7
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:20,790
You came out here
to see Mom?

8
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:22,291
Winchester Surprise?

9
00:00:22,293 --> 00:00:23,626
I take all of that bologna,
all that sliced cheese,

10
00:00:23,628 --> 00:00:25,027
and I put it
onto a hot plate.

11
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:26,529
Dad comes home,

12
00:00:26,531 --> 00:00:28,130
and he picks up everything,
chucks it in the trash.

13
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:30,332
Probably reminded him
of you.

14
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:32,401
Sam!

15
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:33,402
It's a Ma'lak box.

16
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:34,670
Secured and warded.

17
00:00:34,672 --> 00:00:36,839
Once inside...
nothing gets out.

18
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:40,376
We're the guys
who save the world.

19
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:43,646
We don't just
check out of it!

20
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:44,847
Let's go home.

21
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:04,834
Howdy, fellas.

22
00:01:04,836 --> 00:01:07,169
Anything on the shelves,
20% off.

23
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:08,504
Today only.

24
00:01:08,506 --> 00:01:11,440
Great.
Well, actually, we are, uh --

25
00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:13,509
we're looking
for the good stuff.

26
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:15,911
The really good stuff.

27
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,755
Everything back here
is one of a kind.

28
00:01:26,757 --> 00:01:29,458
You got your basics --
hands of glory,

29
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,197
your Gris-Gris bags,
your anointed dove's blood.

30
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:37,867
And then...

31
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:40,970
we have the more
premium items.

32
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:45,708
You boys ever mess
with dragon's breath?

33
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,543
Actually, we're, uh --
we're searching

34
00:01:47,545 --> 00:01:49,044
for something
pretty specific.

35
00:01:49,046 --> 00:01:50,379
How specific?

36
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:52,948
The skull of Sarah Good.

37
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,884
She was executed
during the Salem Witch Trial.

38
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:57,586
Oh, I know who she was.

39
00:01:57,588 --> 00:01:59,822
And I think
I can help you.

40
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:08,931
I wouldn't do that.

41
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:23,078
I'll tell you what.

42
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,780
I'll make you a deal.

43
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:26,916
I got this for a song at
a flea market up in Pawtucket --

44
00:02:26,918 --> 00:02:28,517
No, you didn't.

45
00:02:30,788 --> 00:02:33,189
Belongs to Bart Kemp.

46
00:02:33,191 --> 00:02:36,091
See, he was a friend
of ours -- a Hunter.

47
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:39,795
Worked out of Boston
up until last week.

48
00:02:39,797 --> 00:02:41,330
Somebody killed him --

49
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:43,599
cut him clean in half.

50
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:45,968
See, when they, uh,
found the body,

51
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,436
his place
had been emptied out,

52
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:49,305
but I guess you already knew
that, didn't you?

53
00:02:49,307 --> 00:02:50,606
Huh.

54
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,980
Ohh!

55
00:02:57,982 --> 00:03:00,282
Now, this --
it's called Chrysaor.

56
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:03,018
Supposed to be able
to cut through anything.

57
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,721
Sliced up your pal real good
with just one swing,

58
00:03:05,723 --> 00:03:09,525
but you --
oh, you're a big boy.

59
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:11,794
You might take some work.

60
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,003
They always talk too much.

61
00:03:26,877 --> 00:03:29,311
Whoa.
Dean, according to this,

62
00:03:29,313 --> 00:03:32,514
he's got a ton
of occult objects here.

63
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:34,817
What do you want to do
with all this crap?

64
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:36,552
I don't know.

65
00:03:36,554 --> 00:03:38,887
I mean, I-I guess we, u,
take it home, right?

66
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,393
Right, yeah.

67
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:45,828
Good plan. Home.

68
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,396
It's...

69
00:03:47,398 --> 00:03:51,398

00:03:59,844 --> 00:04:01,610
People say
they're brothers.

72
00:04:01,612 --> 00:04:05,114
All I know is I was standing
right here

73
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:07,049
when I heard this -- bam!

74
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:10,019
From the trunk
of their car.

75
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:14,890
And then this, like,
shallow breathing.

76
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:18,694
No way.

77
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:21,230
Eliot,
you're creeping Max out.

78
00:04:21,232 --> 00:04:22,531
Yeah.

79
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:27,069
That's them.

80
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:33,275
So what -- you're saying
all this stuff is lethal?

81
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:35,077
Yeah, it looks like.

82
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:42,318
Hey.
The Campbell brothers.

83
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,386
Lemme guess --
the usual?

84
00:04:44,388 --> 00:04:45,454
Make it a double.

85
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:50,225
Dean, listen to this --

86
00:04:50,227 --> 00:04:54,596
uh, hangman's rope, fairy dust,
John Wayne Gacy's cigar box.

87
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:57,066
So we're talkin', like,
31 Flavors of weird, huh?

88
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:58,734
Pretty much, yeah.

89
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:00,436
Listen, Jack and Cass
are out with Jules and her crew,

90
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:01,637
but when they get back,
they can give us a hand

91
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,905
cataloging
of all of this.

92
00:05:02,907 --> 00:05:04,573
Oh, cataloging, fun.

93
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:06,141
Something like this --
maybe it's what we need,

94
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:07,576
you know, to -- to...

95
00:05:07,578 --> 00:05:08,977
take your mind off things.

96
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:11,080
Things? What things?

97
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:13,982
Oh, you mean that thing that's
riding shotgun up in my head?

98
00:05:13,984 --> 00:05:15,617
That thing?

99
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:19,021
I mean, think about it.

100
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:20,489
Where did they
even come from?

101
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:22,858
Them or their weird sidekick
with the trench coat.

102
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,760
And what about that kid
with the dumb Bambi look

103
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:25,761
on his face
all the time?

104
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:27,529
So what?

105
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:29,431
That doesn't mean that they
kidnapped Bigfoot or whatever.

106
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:32,201
You guys are dicks.

107
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:35,304
Gotta bounce.

108
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:38,040
See you later?
At the thing?

109
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:40,709
Sure, yeah.

110
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:41,710
- Yeah.
- Us, too.

111
00:05:41,712 --> 00:05:43,379
- Bye.
- Later.

112
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:48,851
Whatever their deal is,
they got an awesome car.

113
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:05,067
You're not
gonna believe this.

114
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:06,702
It's called the Baozhu.

115
00:06:06,704 --> 00:06:08,837
It's one of eight
ancient Chinese treasures.

116
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:11,340
I-It's a pearl
that grants wishes.

117
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:12,808
- Sort of.
- Sort of?

118
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,576
Well, technically,
it's supposed to give you

119
00:06:14,578 --> 00:06:16,311
"what your heart desires."

120
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:18,347
That would be Michael
outta my friggin' head.

121
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:19,948
Exactly.

122
00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:22,718
So, you're telling me

123
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,186
that the answer
to all of our problems

124
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:26,388
is sitting right outside
in the ca--

125
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:33,495
No, no, no, no, no!

126
00:06:33,497 --> 00:06:34,763
What the...

127
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:37,266
Hey, hey, hey!

128
00:06:37,268 --> 00:06:39,701
Hey, hey!
Don't move!

129
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:41,236
I didn't see anything,
I swear.

130
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:42,704
Okay. Listen,
that car is dangerous, okay?

131
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:44,273
Swear to God, if anything
happens to that car --

132
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:45,741
Please,
I don't wanna die!

133
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,911
Die? Why --
Why would you...

134
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:53,282
Just tell us
what you saw.

135
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:54,583
I don't wanna narc.

136
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:57,352
You don't have a choice.

137
00:06:57,354 --> 00:06:59,788
Okay.
It's this girl Max.

138
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,056
She's new in town,

139
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:03,091
so I don't even know
where she lives.

140
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:05,961
Don't.

141
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:13,869
- Help you?
- I hope so.

142
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:16,638
Um, I'm looking for a --
a local kid, a teenager --

143
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,240
Max something.

144
00:07:18,242 --> 00:07:20,609
I feel bad.
I paid her to wash my car,

145
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:22,110
but she took off
before I could tip her,

146
00:07:22,112 --> 00:07:23,312
and I figured you knew
everyone in town --

147
00:07:23,314 --> 00:07:24,546
So you want me to give you

148
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:26,215
an underage girl's
address?

149
00:07:26,217 --> 00:07:27,816
No, uh --

150
00:07:27,818 --> 00:07:28,884
It's not like that.

151
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:30,752
I...

152
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:33,388
Marta.
How's that grandson of yours?

153
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,793
Oh, he's a spoiled
little jerk, but I love him.

154
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:40,562
'Course you do.

155
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:41,964
Uh, listen,
my brother and I,

156
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:44,399
we just need to talk
to this girl, okay?

157
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:45,801
So, if you
could help us out,

158
00:07:45,803 --> 00:07:47,169
I would -- I would
really appreciate it.

159
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:50,839
Oh, now, Dean,
I-I-I can't just go around

160
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:53,108
handing out addresses
all willy nilly.

161
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,911
I-I-I-I took a vow.

162
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:57,446
Please.

163
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,183
But, um...

164
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:09,424
I can tell you
where to find her mother.

165
00:08:09,426 --> 00:08:10,659
Oh.

166
00:08:11,762 --> 00:08:13,195
All right.

167
00:08:19,537 --> 00:08:20,869
I'm gonna kill her.

168
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:22,471
Does Max have a phone?

169
00:08:22,473 --> 00:08:24,606
O-Or do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

170
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:26,708
She's supposed
to be in school.

171
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,877
Skip day.

172
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,112
What day?

173
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:31,513
February 7th --
that's skip day.

174
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:33,181
Kids ditch school.

175
00:08:33,183 --> 00:08:35,484
Some of them head out
to this old house on Route 36 --

176
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:36,852
throw a party.

177
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:39,988
It's a small town, man.

178
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,790
Kids got to
blow off steam.

179
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:50,966
What is all this stuff?

180
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:52,801
Found it in the back
of the car.

181
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:55,804
Ugh, creeeepy.

182
00:08:55,806 --> 00:08:57,739
No. It's awesome.

183
00:08:57,741 --> 00:08:59,541
Pizza's here.

184
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:01,510
Oh, thank God.

185
00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:04,413
- Oh, I'm so excited for pizza.
- Me too.

186
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:06,582
- I haven't eaten all morning.
- Oh, well,

187
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:08,350
I haven't had pizza...

188
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:37,665
Hey!
Th-- Those guys,

189
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:39,066
they're after Max,
and they said something about --

190
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:41,335
Dude, one --
you're not supposed to be here.

191
00:09:41,337 --> 00:09:43,170
Two -- chill.

192
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:44,338
Max can handle herself.

193
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:26,747
Oh, baby.

194
00:10:26,749 --> 00:10:28,415
Baby, baby, please tell me
you're not hurt.

195
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:33,287
Dean.

196
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:34,988
Back seat.

197
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:37,658
It's empty.

198
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,892
Ethan?

199
00:10:38,894 --> 00:10:40,227
Ethan, wait!

200
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:43,764
Ethan, wait!

201
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:44,898
- Wait, wait.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

202
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,066
What's going on?
What happened?

203
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:47,568
He said he saw a ghost.

204
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,737
It was a clown.
He said it tried to kill him!

205
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:53,440
FBI!
Everybody out!

206
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:55,642
Let's go!
Move, move!

207
00:10:57,513 --> 00:10:59,613
- Go!
- FBI?

208
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:01,315
Hey, let's go.
Come on, huh?

209
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,486
All right.

210
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:07,821
Any of this stuff
scream "clown" to you?

211
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,193
John Wayne Gacy's
cigar box.

212
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:19,733
I mean...

213
00:11:20,936 --> 00:11:22,369
We should burn that
right now.

214
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:24,438
Oh, yeah.

215
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,340
A serial killer clown.

216
00:11:26,342 --> 00:11:27,641
I mean, this is, like,
the best/worst thing

217
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:28,876
that's ever happened to you,
you know,

218
00:11:28,878 --> 00:11:29,943
'cause you love
serial killers,

219
00:11:29,945 --> 00:11:31,044
but --
but you hate clowns.

220
00:11:31,046 --> 00:11:32,713
Yeah, I get it, Dean.

221
00:11:32,715 --> 00:11:35,282
Yeah, just saying.

222
00:11:40,456 --> 00:11:41,688
Come on.

223
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,224
Sam...today.

224
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:52,966
Sam.

225
00:11:54,136 --> 00:11:55,235
Screw this.

226
00:11:55,237 --> 00:11:58,005
Eliot, no!

227
00:12:14,723 --> 00:12:17,524
Uh...

228
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:21,528
Hey!

229
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,729
That was a ghost.

230
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:24,398
Yeah, yeah, okay, listen.

231
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,899
I-I know you need --
or you want

232
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:27,501
some sort
of rational explanation

233
00:12:27,503 --> 00:12:30,504
for what happened here,
but...

234
00:12:30,506 --> 00:12:31,772
there isn't one.

235
00:12:36,245 --> 00:12:39,213
My brother and I,
we hunt things.

236
00:12:39,215 --> 00:12:40,781
Evil things
that shouldn't exist.

237
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:42,282
And we are damn good
at what we do.

238
00:12:42,284 --> 00:12:44,051
I knew it!

239
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:47,054
Yeah, but if most people
out there knew the truth,

240
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:49,056
if they knew
what was out there --

241
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:51,058
They'd lose
their freaking minds.

242
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,693
So what you saw here today,

243
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:54,695
we're gonna keep that
our secret.

244
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:10,077
Okay.

245
00:13:15,117 --> 00:13:16,550
John Wayne Gacy's ghost.

246
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:18,952
Well, that's one
for the record books.

247
00:13:18,954 --> 00:13:20,454
Dean.

248
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:21,788
Mm?

249
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,557
I think this is it.

250
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,893
- The pearl?
- Yeah.

251
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:27,394
Let's do it.

252
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:29,129
Are you -- Are you sure
you don't want to call Mom

253
00:13:29,131 --> 00:13:30,264
or -- or wait for Cass?

254
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:32,432
No.
No, 'cause, you know,

255
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:34,835
if this mojo works
like you say, great.

256
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:37,337
If not...
why get their hopes up?

257
00:13:38,974 --> 00:13:40,073
Yeah.

258
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:41,708
Okay.

259
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:44,912
So, what do I...

260
00:13:44,914 --> 00:13:46,246
I don't know.

261
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:47,748
I-I guess you --
you hold the pearl

262
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,784
and -- and concentrate
on what your heart desires.

263
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:52,219
Michael outta my head.

264
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:55,455
Got it.

265
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,450
Don't you move.

266
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:37,731
Dad?

267
00:14:45,113 --> 00:14:46,912
Dean?

268
00:14:46,914 --> 00:14:49,515
Sam?

269
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:50,783
What in the hell?

270
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:56,522
Sammy.

271
00:14:56,524 --> 00:14:59,925
Aren't you supposed to be
in Palo Alto?

272
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:00,960
Palo Alto?

273
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:06,265
What happened to you?

274
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:09,435
What year is it?

275
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:13,439
It's 2003.

276
00:15:13,441 --> 00:15:16,308
It's 2019.

277
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,643
No.

278
00:15:20,114 --> 00:15:22,481
How?

279
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:24,316
We, uh...

280
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:26,352
I-I think
we summoned you.

281
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:34,026
You boys better tell me what
the hell is going on right now.

282
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:45,237
So, you saved the world?

283
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:47,473
More than once.

284
00:15:47,475 --> 00:15:49,341
Then it's all true.

285
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:52,978
God, the Devil,
you boys smack in the middle.

286
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,047
Now you live
in a secret bunker

287
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:59,185
with an angel
and Lucifer's kid.

288
00:15:59,187 --> 00:16:00,920
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

289
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,025
And you've done this whole
time-travel thing before?

290
00:16:06,027 --> 00:16:07,993
A few times.

291
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:10,496
Actually, uh,
our grandfather,

292
00:16:10,498 --> 00:16:12,031
your dad --

293
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:14,066
he's the one that helped us
find this place.

294
00:16:15,236 --> 00:16:19,371
I think he'd be real happy
to know you're finally here.

295
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:21,507
Right. Man 'a Letters.

296
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:22,708
Yeah.

297
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,545
W-We're legacies...

298
00:16:26,547 --> 00:16:27,713
because of you.

299
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:39,258
So, you've, um --
you've been busy.

300
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,559
A little bit.

301
00:16:41,362 --> 00:16:42,862
I-I don't...

302
00:16:42,864 --> 00:16:45,064
I-I just...

303
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:49,535
I just wish that I had
been there to see it.

304
00:16:53,074 --> 00:16:56,308
Dad, none of this would have
happened without you.

305
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,144
It's good. It's fine.

306
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:03,449
I-I went out takin' out
Yellow Eyes.

307
00:17:03,451 --> 00:17:06,051
I mean, that was the point,
right?

308
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:09,221
I mean, get the thing
that killed Mom.

309
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:16,228
Yeah, yeah, uh, Dad.

310
00:17:18,065 --> 00:17:19,431
About Mom...

311
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:23,636
Sam? Dean?

312
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:25,170
Mary?

313
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:56,702
It's Dad.

314
00:17:56,704 --> 00:17:59,438
This is amazing, man.
I'm -- I'm -- I'm freaking out.

315
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,875
Yeah, I know.
But, Dean -- Dean, listen.

316
00:18:02,877 --> 00:18:05,644
What? What?

317
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:06,812
How did this happen?

318
00:18:06,814 --> 00:18:08,714
I-I-I don't know.

319
00:18:08,716 --> 00:18:10,482
You said that the --
the pearl gives you

320
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:12,284
what your heart desires,
right?

321
00:18:12,286 --> 00:18:13,485
So, my heart desired --

322
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:15,521
I --
I've wanted this, man.

323
00:18:15,523 --> 00:18:17,723
I've -- I've wanted this
since I was 4 years old.

324
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:20,459
Okay, I know, and
I-I-I-I love this, too, Dean.

325
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:23,629
I do, honestly, but --
but messing with time --

326
00:18:23,631 --> 00:18:25,064
No, no, no, Sam.

327
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:26,699
You know how this ends.
Things change.

328
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:28,233
Yeah, great -- we got
our family back together.

329
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:30,002
I'll take that change.
That's not what I mean.

330
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:31,804
Stop.
Just stop, okay?

331
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:33,472
Look, can -- can we
just have one family dinner?

332
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:34,673
Just one?

333
00:18:34,675 --> 00:18:37,643
Us -- all of us together.

334
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:40,980
That's all I want.
Can you just give me that?

335
00:18:40,982 --> 00:18:42,881
Dean --

336
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,736
This place --
I don't even know.

337
00:19:05,673 --> 00:19:07,039
Yeah, yeah.

338
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,409
Uh, when we -- we, uh,
first moved in,

339
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:12,878
I-I think it
kind of blew our minds, too.

340
00:19:16,217 --> 00:19:18,717
Um, where's --
where's Mom?

341
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:21,053
Oh, she's, uh, gettin'
your brother a shopping list.

342
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:23,522
She's gonna make that
casserole of hers.

343
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:29,962
Yeah, Dean and I tried
to make that once.

344
00:19:34,535 --> 00:19:38,070
I, um...I remember.

345
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:46,478
I screwed up with you a lot,
didn't I?

346
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:52,918
No, that's okay.

347
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,722
No, it's not.

348
00:19:56,724 --> 00:20:00,459
Sammy, tell me the truth.

349
00:20:00,461 --> 00:20:03,162
I don't want
to talk about that.

350
00:20:03,164 --> 00:20:04,430
You didn't have
a problem

351
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,632
talking about it
before you left.

352
00:20:08,636 --> 00:20:10,335
Dad...

353
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:15,140
...for me?

354
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:16,942
That fight...

355
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,848
...that was
a lifetime ago.

356
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:27,352
I don't even remember
what I said, and --

357
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:34,359
I mean...yeah.

358
00:20:34,361 --> 00:20:35,527
You know what?

359
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:37,763
You did some
messed-up things.

360
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:42,301
But I don't...

361
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:48,373
I mean,
when I think about you...

362
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,011
...and I think about you

363
00:20:53,013 --> 00:20:54,313
a lot...

364
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,616
...I don't think about
our -- our fights.

365
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:03,122
I think about you...

366
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:08,694
I think about you
on the floor of that hospital.

367
00:21:11,665 --> 00:21:14,633
And I think about how
I never got to say goodbye.

368
00:21:23,177 --> 00:21:24,409
Sam.

369
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,747
Son.

370
00:21:28,749 --> 00:21:30,849
I am so sorry.

371
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,890
I'm sorry, too.

372
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:41,827
But you did your best,
Dad.

373
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:43,495
You --

374
00:21:43,497 --> 00:21:46,064
You fought for us,
and you loved us, and...

375
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,003
...that's enough.

376
00:21:59,346 --> 00:22:00,913
Okay.

377
00:22:02,516 --> 00:22:04,383
Dean.
Hold on. Hold on.

378
00:22:04,385 --> 00:22:06,084
Just...

379
00:22:06,086 --> 00:22:08,720
What?

380
00:22:08,722 --> 00:22:12,224
Listen.
You, um...

381
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:17,262
You're right.

382
00:22:20,568 --> 00:22:22,367
You want some company?

383
00:22:42,656 --> 00:22:44,089
All right.

384
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:45,424
I'll get the booze --
you get the food.

385
00:22:48,162 --> 00:22:50,929
All right, Jackson.
It's celebration time.

386
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:52,798
Give me your best stuff.

387
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,467
Uh, do I know you?

388
00:22:55,469 --> 00:22:56,768
It's Dean.

389
00:22:58,172 --> 00:23:00,072
Campbell.

390
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:02,474
I come in here,
like, always.

391
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:06,945
Oh. Right.

392
00:23:06,947 --> 00:23:08,180
Right.

393
00:23:14,355 --> 00:23:15,654
Hey, Max.

394
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,290
Weirdo.

395
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,436
Hi.

396
00:23:55,562 --> 00:23:57,296
Dean.

397
00:23:57,298 --> 00:23:58,664
Dean, we have a problem.

398
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,299
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

399
00:24:00,301 --> 00:24:01,667
Check this out.

400
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:03,568
Is that me?

401
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,706
According to the Internet, you
run a law firm and love kale.

402
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:11,410
Wait till you check out your,
uh, wannabe TED Talk.

403
00:24:11,412 --> 00:24:15,180
<i>Invest in a treadmill desk,</i>
<i>don't drink coffee,</i>

404
00:24:15,182 --> 00:24:16,915
<i>and stick to</i>
<i>a raw food diet.</i>

405
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:20,419
<i>I mean, God bless kale --</i>
<i>am I right?</i>

406
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:23,021
<i>Truth is...</i>

407
00:24:23,023 --> 00:24:24,389
All right --
No, no, it gets worse.

408
00:24:24,391 --> 00:24:25,557
<i>...and this</i>

<i>-Every last drop.</i>
-Okay.

412
00:24:32,032 --> 00:24:33,332
<i>You see,</i>

413
00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:36,001

414
00:24:36,003 --> 00:24:39,571

<i>or even having a family.</i>

415
00:24:39,573 --> 00:24:40,939
Okay.
That's enough of that.

416
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:42,708
Listen, Dean,
there is a wanted poster for you

417
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,076
hanging in the post office.

418
00:24:44,078 --> 00:24:45,510
Oh, yeah, no,
I-I Googled me, as well.

419
00:24:45,512 --> 00:24:47,079
Um, lotta beheadings.

420
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:48,747
I was right --

421
00:24:48,749 --> 00:24:50,849
messing with time
changed things.

422
00:24:50,851 --> 00:24:53,685
Well, I mean, I'm still hunting,
but you're Internet famous.

423
00:24:53,687 --> 00:24:56,388
So, what -- is there two of us
running around here?

424
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,758
No, I don't think so.
I think it's a temporal paradox.

425
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
We pulled Dad here
from 2003, right?

426
00:25:01,762 --> 00:25:03,261
So time
is self-correcting.

427
00:25:03,263 --> 00:25:05,864
Our timeline is changing
to this new one.

428
00:25:05,866 --> 00:25:07,366
So, what do you mean?

429
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:10,402
It means, I think, that,
if we don't fix this,

430
00:25:10,404 --> 00:25:13,205
then we become those
other versions of ourselves.

431
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:14,740
Like, for real.

432
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,243
Okay, well, I'm cool,
but you're -- ugh.

433
00:25:18,245 --> 00:25:19,945
That's not the point.
The point is,

434
00:25:19,947 --> 00:25:24,049
if -- if all this is different,
then what else changed?

435
00:25:44,647 --> 00:25:48,916
Earth -- where you're always
stepping in something.

436
00:25:48,918 --> 00:25:51,585
Come on, Constantine.

437
00:25:51,587 --> 00:25:53,253
I don't understand
that reference.

438
00:25:53,255 --> 00:25:54,488
You wouldn't.

439
00:25:57,593 --> 00:26:00,027
How are we
gonna tell Dad?

440
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:01,295
I don't know.

441
00:26:01,297 --> 00:26:03,831
How are we gonna tell Mom?

442
00:26:08,337 --> 00:26:11,138
It's been hard moving around,
but I'm happy.

443
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:14,641
Can I help you?

444
00:26:14,643 --> 00:26:15,943
Bet you can.

445
00:26:15,945 --> 00:26:20,280
See, I need to know...

446
00:26:20,282 --> 00:26:22,683
who's been messing
with time.

447
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:24,184
I'm sorry?

448
00:26:24,186 --> 00:26:25,786
Yeah, we sensed a --

449
00:26:25,788 --> 00:26:28,388
well, let's call it
a disturbance in the Force.

450
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,023
And in Heaven, well,

451
00:26:30,025 --> 00:26:31,625
we're -- we're
not super fond of those.

452
00:26:31,627 --> 00:26:33,327
In Heaven?

453
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:35,329
Yeah, yeah.
In Heaven.

454
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:39,533
This town --

455
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:42,536
it's always been
a little...muddy for us.

456
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:45,939
Some sort of...interference.

457
00:26:47,476 --> 00:26:48,675
Hi.

458
00:26:50,546 --> 00:26:54,014
So, I'm going to ask
one more time --

459
00:26:54,016 --> 00:26:57,851
who's been playing
"Back to the Future"?

460
00:26:57,853 --> 00:27:01,255
And you're going to tell me,
or he --

461
00:27:01,257 --> 00:27:02,422
What's the phrase
I'm looking for?

462
00:27:02,424 --> 00:27:04,358
He -- oh --

463
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,559
murders you all.

464
00:27:07,229 --> 00:27:09,930
My name is Castiel.

465
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:11,665
I'm an angel of the Lord.

466
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:21,909
Let's get out of here.

467
00:27:21,911 --> 00:27:23,877
What the hell?

468
00:27:36,358 --> 00:27:39,293
Get out. Go, go!
Go!

469
00:27:39,295 --> 00:27:40,994
The Winchesters?

470
00:27:42,531 --> 00:27:45,766
Zachariah?
Cass?

471
00:27:45,768 --> 00:27:48,869
Now, I-I-I know
we had big plans for you,

472
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:52,873
and then your daddy just up
and disappeared, which...

473
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:56,109
Oh. You.

474
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,479
This is all you.

475
00:28:01,383 --> 00:28:03,951
Cass, you know us.

476
00:28:03,953 --> 00:28:05,218
I don't know you.

477
00:28:08,457 --> 00:28:10,123
Kill them.

478
00:28:13,796 --> 00:28:15,395
Cass, don't!

479
00:28:21,637 --> 00:28:23,270
What did you do, Sam?

480
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,081
What did you do?

481
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,582
Sam.

482
00:28:35,584 --> 00:28:38,285
Speak, Ubu, speak.

483
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:41,088
What?

484
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,256
What is it?

485
00:29:08,017 --> 00:29:09,316
Aah!

486
00:29:14,189 --> 00:29:16,023
Ohh!

487
00:29:19,728 --> 00:29:21,661
Ohh!

488
00:29:27,002 --> 00:29:29,136
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no!

489
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:35,375
Cass.

490
00:29:35,377 --> 00:29:36,610
Cass.

491
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,313
Stop it.

492
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:07,071
A "temporal paradox"?

493
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:10,207
That's what Sam's
calling it.

494
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:12,710
Egghead.

495
00:30:12,712 --> 00:30:18,749
Basically, uh,
if you don't go back,

496
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:20,751
Sam never gets
back into the life,

497
00:30:20,753 --> 00:30:24,889
um, and Mom, she, uh...

498
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:27,692
What?

499
00:30:27,694 --> 00:30:30,094
Well, without everything
that we did --

500
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:33,864
with God, The Darkness --

501
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:35,132
she never comes back.

502
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:39,537
Sam thinks that
she'll just fade away.

503
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:45,509
Okay.

504
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,012
I mean,
me versus your mom?

505
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:51,115
That's -- That's
not even a choice.

506
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:56,387
Does she know?

507
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:04,128
How?

508
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:09,233
Uh, the, uh...

509
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:12,370
the lore is pretty clear.

510
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:16,707
We destroy the pearl,
and it unwinds all of this.

511
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,776
Dad goes back...

512
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:20,911
and so will
everything else.

513
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,951
And he won't
remember anything?

514
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:31,322
No.

515
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:40,931
Sam, I can't.

516
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:43,167
I know.
I know, Mom.

517
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,614
You want to give
your mom a hand?

518
00:31:56,616 --> 00:31:57,848
Yeah.

519
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:00,785
Dean.

520
00:32:00,787 --> 00:32:05,423
I, uh --
I never meant for this.

521
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:06,624
Dad, we pulled you here.

522
00:32:06,626 --> 00:32:09,193
No, son.

523
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:11,462
My fight.

524
00:32:11,464 --> 00:32:16,133
It was supposed to end with me,
with Yellow Eyes.

525
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:20,938
But now you --
you are a grown man,

526
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,808
and I am incredibly
proud of you.

527
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,846
I guess that I had hoped,
eventually,

528
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:30,548
you would...

529
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,885
get yourself a normal life,
a peaceful life, a family.

530
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:39,990
I have a family.

531
00:32:42,695 --> 00:32:44,662
Yeah.

532
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,499
All right.
What's next?

533
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:52,470
We eat.

534
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,836
All right.

535
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:29,507
Near as I can tell,
we have two choices.

536
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:32,676
All right, we can think
about what's coming.

537
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,545
Or we can be grateful

538
00:33:34,547 --> 00:33:36,347
for this time
that we have together.

539
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:38,949
Now, me...

540
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:40,718
I choose grateful.

541
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:48,225
So, to whatever
brought us together,

542
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:50,594
we owe you one.

543
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:52,730
Amen.

544
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:54,031
Amen.

545
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,900
Amen.

546
00:33:55,902 --> 00:33:57,468
Amen.

547
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,575
Yeah!

548
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:12,950
? I've been too long
on these islands ?

549
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,255
? I've been far too long alone ?

550
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:20,891
? I've been too long
without summer ?

551
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,793
? In this winter home ?

552
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:30,568
? Still,
if we can make the effort ?

553
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:34,638
? If we take the time ?

554
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,309
? Maybe we can leave
this much behind ?

555
00:34:41,614 --> 00:34:43,447
? Till it shines ?

556
00:34:45,017 --> 00:34:47,751
? Mm, till it shines ?

557
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:56,126
Did you see them at dinner,
way they looked at each other?

558
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,163
They just seemed happy,
you know?

559
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:03,434
It doesn't feel fair
to get all this

560
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:06,103
and have to throw it away,
and I know we have to.

561
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:08,105
But it just feels like,
you know...

562
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:12,776
Once we send Dad back...

563
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,111
it's like none of this
ever happened.

564
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:18,115
He -- He just goes back
to -- to...

565
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:20,284
to being Dad.

566
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:22,786
You saying you wish things
would be different?

567
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,855
Don't you?

568
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:26,223
Can you imagine --

569
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:27,958
Dad in the past,

570
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,393
knowing then
what he knows now?

571
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:31,562
I...

572
00:35:31,564 --> 00:35:33,397
I think
it would be nice.

573
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,634
Yeah.

574
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:38,769
I used to think that,
too.

575
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:44,174
But, uh...

576
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:45,976
I mean, look, we've been through
some tough times.

577
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:47,311
There's no denying that.

578
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:48,912
Yeah.

579
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:51,181
And for the longest time,
I blamed Dad.

580
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:54,918
I mean, hell,
I blamed Mom, too, you know?

581
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,855
I was angry.

582
00:35:57,857 --> 00:36:02,192
But say we could send Dad back
knowing everything.

583
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:04,528
Why stop there?

584
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,398
Why not send him
even further back

585
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,934
and let some other poor
sons of bitches save the world?

586
00:36:12,538 --> 00:36:14,872
But here's the problem.

587
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:16,674
Who does that make us?

588
00:36:19,412 --> 00:36:20,844
Would we be better off?

589
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,179
Well, maybe.

590
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:25,082
But I got to be honest --

591
00:36:25,084 --> 00:36:27,284
I don't know who that
Dean Winchester is.

592
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:32,389
And I'm good
with who I am.

593
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:33,857
I'm good
with who you are.

594
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:42,566
'Cause our lives --
they're ours.

595
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:45,936
And maybe I'm just too damn old
to want to change that.

596
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:57,481
I hate this.

597
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:59,216
So do I.

598
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,792
Okay.

599
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,766
My girl.

600
00:37:20,172 --> 00:37:23,640
I miss you so damn much.

601
00:37:23,642 --> 00:37:25,109
Me too.

602
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:47,965
You two.

603
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:52,536
You take care
of each other.

604
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,339
We always do.

605
00:37:58,277 --> 00:38:00,644
Good to see you, Dad.

606
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:02,713
Yeah.

607
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:07,785
I am so proud
of you boys.

608
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:27,971
I love you both so much.

609
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:39,349
I love you, too.

610
00:38:41,754 --> 00:38:43,420
Okay.

611
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:48,158
Okay.

612
00:38:49,862 --> 00:38:51,895
I'm ready.

613
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:06,510
Sammy.

614
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:11,808
Monsters!

615
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,444
Those guys
hunt monsters!

616
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,281
That is so cool.

617
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:32,462
Mary, Sam, Dean.

618
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:38,435
What happened?

619
00:40:40,306 --> 00:40:42,139
What happened?

620
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:46,376
Well, there's a story.

621
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,064
Dean.

622
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:09,733
No, I'm okay.

623
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:11,568
I just...

624
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:15,539
I just had
one hell of a dream.

625
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:16,907
Yeah.

626
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:19,476
No, it was a good one.

627
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:21,511
I'm on my way back.

628
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:23,380
I'll see you soon.
