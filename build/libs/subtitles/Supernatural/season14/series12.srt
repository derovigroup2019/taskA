1
00:00:03,432 --> 00:00:04,698
Who are you?

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,400
We're the guys that
save that world.

3
00:00:06,402 --> 00:00:08,602
- What are you doing?
- What I have to.

4
00:00:10,372 --> 00:00:11,571
He's brain dead.

5
00:00:11,573 --> 00:00:13,407
Machines keeping him
breathing.

6
00:00:13,409 --> 00:00:14,441
It's like you said, Dean.

7
00:00:14,443 --> 00:00:16,076
Whatever it takes.

8
00:00:17,112 --> 00:00:19,212
Huh?

9
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:21,581
Nick said when he left
he was just gonna go home.

10
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:22,916
I-I didn't know
he was...

11
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:24,184
Killing people?

12
00:00:24,186 --> 00:00:25,619
My whole family
was slaughtered.

13
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,088
The best thing
I could hope for

14
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,423
is that I catch the monster
who did it.

15
00:00:29,425 --> 00:00:30,590
There's this guy.

16
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:32,259
He said his name
was "Abraxas."

17
00:00:32,261 --> 00:00:34,161
No way.

18
00:00:34,163 --> 00:00:35,362
Nick?

19
00:00:35,364 --> 00:00:36,897
Aah!

20
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:43,136
You couldn't fix me 'cause
I don't want to be fixed.

21
00:00:45,107 --> 00:00:46,740
I can feel him
in my head.

22
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:48,842
Michael gets out,
that's it for this world.

23
00:00:48,844 --> 00:00:51,812
Billie said that there's only
one way that this ends right.

24
00:00:51,814 --> 00:00:54,414
A Ma'lak box.
Secured and warded.

25
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:57,551
Once inside...nothing gets out,
not even an archangel.

26
00:00:57,553 --> 00:00:59,653
Plan is to charter a boat
to take me out to the Pacific.

27
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:00,654
Splash.

28
00:01:00,656 --> 00:01:01,788
You and Michael,

29
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,957
trapped together --
for eternity?

30
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:08,929
It's the only sane play
I've got.

31
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:44,731
No. No!

32
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:53,707
Sam!

33
00:01:58,113 --> 00:01:59,980
Sam!

34
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:07,621
No, no, no, no!

35
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:10,056
What?

36
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:13,293
Sam?

37
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:15,529
Sammy?

38
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:16,897
Sammy!

Didn't mean to wake you.
Sorry.

43
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:39,719
No, it's just a...
bad dream.

<i> Sammy?</i>

45
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:43,189
It's fine.

46
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:44,457
You want
to talk about it?

47
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,394
No, I'm --
No, I'm okay.

48
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:51,231
What are you doing?
Why don't you get some sleep?

49
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:52,999
You know, Dean,

50
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:54,734
you don't
have to act like

51
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:57,404
what you're planning to do
is just business as usual.

52
00:02:57,406 --> 00:03:00,640
I-I know you're scared.

53
00:03:00,642 --> 00:03:03,109
Never said
I wasn't scared.

54
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:05,545
- But it doesn't matter.
-Doesn't matter?

55
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:10,350
Dean, we know we could die,
uh, doing what we do.

56
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:12,419
It's always a possibility.
But what you're talking about

57
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:13,987
is far worse
than death.

58
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:16,022
Michael's an archangel.

59
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:18,024
He could
literally keep you

60
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:21,695
buried in a coffin,
alive, forever.

61
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:23,163
Okay.

62
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:24,230
I get it.

63
00:03:24,232 --> 00:03:25,665
But what's
the other option, huh?

64
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:28,501
Michael gets outta my head
and ends the world?

65
00:03:28,503 --> 00:03:30,136
'Cause it's all right there
in Billie's book.

66
00:03:30,138 --> 00:03:31,871
Yeah, but that's only
if don't find another way

67
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:34,107
to take Michael off the board,
and there has to be another way.

68
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:35,675
And what
is that other way?

69
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:40,947
Exactly.

70
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:49,215
Aah!

71
00:04:49,217 --> 00:04:51,918
Help, please! Please!

72
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,720
No!

73
00:04:58,427 --> 00:05:01,227
Please! No!

74
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,304
Okay, sunshine.

75
00:05:44,306 --> 00:05:45,572
Soup's on.

76
00:05:46,174 --> 00:05:48,575
And bad
as the food is here?

77
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:51,377
Gourmet compared to what
you'll be gettin' in jail,

78
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:53,346
so...enjoy.

79
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,550
When am I
getting out of here?

80
00:05:59,154 --> 00:06:01,254
I'm not sure.

81
00:06:01,256 --> 00:06:04,324
At least four jurisdictions
want to prosecute.

82
00:06:05,193 --> 00:06:07,427
You were a busy bee.

83
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:10,063
Yeah, what went down...

84
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:11,698
none of that
was my fault.

85
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,233
Right.

86
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:15,101
'Cause you were "possessed."
By "Satan."

87
00:06:15,103 --> 00:06:17,103
And that's real.

88
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:19,405
That's a real thing,
okay?

89
00:06:19,407 --> 00:06:21,074
And he left me, but...

90
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:24,177
...it changed me.

91
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,981
Listen,
you piece of crap.

92
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:30,950
You want to say the Devil
made you do it,

93
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:33,586
well,
you stick with that.

94
00:06:33,588 --> 00:06:36,122
'Cause either way,
you're gonna be locked up

95
00:06:36,124 --> 00:06:38,358
for the rest
of your life.

96
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,759
You're done.

97
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:41,461
You're buried.

98
00:07:02,484 --> 00:07:04,651
Hey.

99
00:07:04,653 --> 00:07:06,486
Man, I-I just want
to make sure that

100
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:08,655
you're still with me
on this thing.

101
00:07:08,657 --> 00:07:10,690
You're gonna see it
through to the end.

102
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:12,158
Well, I gave you my word,
didn't I?

103
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,793
Okay, all right.
Just, you know,

104
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:15,862
after what you said last night,
I-I-I don't need you and Mom

105
00:07:15,864 --> 00:07:17,130
coming up with
some way to stop me.

106
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:18,498
You know,
Mom hates this.

107
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,866
I hate this.
I know.

108
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:22,168
And Cass and Jack,
you haven't even told them.

109
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,603
Okay, well, yeah,
that's because I'm not good

110
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:25,305
with the whole big goodbyes,
all right?

111
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:27,373
I-I-I don't need
to get shaky on this thing.

112
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,142
Wouldn't be
the worst thing.

113
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:34,714
You know what
Michael wants to do,

114
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:36,149
you know that
this will stop it,

115
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:37,750
and you know that
there's no other way.

116
00:07:37,752 --> 00:07:39,853
So just put the end of this trip
out of your head, okay?

117
00:07:57,372 --> 00:07:59,606
Sam.
<i>Cass.</i>

118
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:01,741
Were you able
to talk him out of it?

119
00:08:01,743 --> 00:08:03,643
No. So I'm counting
on you.

120
00:08:03,645 --> 00:08:06,079
Um, any luck?
I-I did as you asked.

121
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:08,014
I've -- I've looked for
any possible way

122
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:10,416
to forcibly extract Michael
and destroy him.

123
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:12,785
- But so far, nothing.
- And what about Rowena?

124
00:08:12,787 --> 00:08:15,355
<i>She went through the entire</i>
<i>Book of the Damned</i>

125
00:08:15,357 --> 00:08:17,690
<i>and found nothing.</i>
<i>And I told her to do it again,</i>

126
00:08:17,692 --> 00:08:20,860
see if she missed
something, and, uh...

127
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:24,664
well, the woman has a remarkable
command of profanity.

128
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,799
All right, thanks.
Uh, keep going.

129
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:30,303
Sam. Maybe if
I spoke with Dean...

130
00:08:30,305 --> 00:08:31,704
It wouldn't matter.
Believe me,

131
00:08:31,706 --> 00:08:33,740
I-I've never seen him
like this.

132
00:08:33,742 --> 00:08:35,475
He won't listen to me.
H-He just --

133
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:37,243
No.

134
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:38,711
If we don't
find some way...

135
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:41,447
...Dean's gone.

136
00:09:34,202 --> 00:09:37,704
"For I will
strike down the firstborn

137
00:09:37,706 --> 00:09:40,707
in the land of Egypt..."

138
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:43,943
What are you doing?

139
00:09:46,214 --> 00:09:49,248
"And against
all the gods of Egypt

140
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,450
I will execute judgment."

141
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:52,018
You don't have to do this.

142
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,988
No. Please, no!

143
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:35,795
"I am the Lord."

144
00:11:00,342 --> 00:11:03,176
You ever think about
when we were kids?

145
00:11:03,178 --> 00:11:05,979
Maybe. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes. W-Why?

146
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:12,152
I know I wasn't always
the greatest brother to you.

147
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:19,292
Dean,
you were the one

148
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:24,097
who was always
there for me.

149
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:25,599
The only one.

150
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,235
I mean, you practically
raised me.

151
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:34,908
I know things
got dicey...

152
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,377
you know, with Dad...

153
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:38,979
the way he was.

154
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:40,714
And I just...

155
00:11:40,716 --> 00:11:43,650
I didn't always look out for you
the way that I should've.

156
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:46,353
I mean, I had
my own stuff, you know.

157
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:47,788
In order
to keep the peace,

158
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,990
probably looked like
I took his side quite a bit.

159
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,297
Sometimes, when I was...

160
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,666
when I was away,

161
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:02,002
you know it wasn't
'cause I just ran out, right?

162
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:07,541
Dad would...

163
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:10,510
He would send me away
when I really pissed him off.

164
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:14,648
I think
you knew that.

165
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:18,118
Man, I left that behind
a long time ago.

166
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:21,655
I had to.

167
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,658
And if we're gonna
get through this,

168
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,160
I-I have to do
like you said and...

169
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:29,629
try and keep my mind off
of where we're going.

170
00:12:29,631 --> 00:12:32,566
So if we could not

171
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:35,869
have conversations
that sound like...

172
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:38,171
deathbed apologies,

173
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:41,074
I would
really appreciate it.

174
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:43,677
Right, yeah.

175
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:55,689
Answer me.

176
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,791
Answer me.
You owe me that.

177
00:12:57,793 --> 00:13:00,026
I think God's
pretty done with you.

178
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:02,562
Why would you even
bother praying to him?

179
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:03,930
I wouldn't.

180
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,202
Could you do me a solid?
I have to use the can.

181
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:14,708
Oh, come on.

182
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:17,978
Seriously?

183
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,913
Come on, man,
give me a little bit of --

184
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:22,282
a little dignity.
I got, uh -- I got, uh, cuffs.

185
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:24,718
I got a bum leg.
What the heck am I gonna do?

186
00:13:26,155 --> 00:13:28,088
Thank you.

187
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,289
You know the drill.

188
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,124
Hands behind your back.

189
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:32,325
Yeah.

190
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,934
Listen, I, uh -- I'm pretty sure
I found us a case.

191
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,902
A case?
Yeah.

192
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:19,339
You know this trip
isn't about finding a case.

193
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:21,808
I know, I know,
but -- but it's on the way --

194
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,376
uh, Fort Dodge, Iowa.

195
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:25,178
And if we can help,

196
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,981
then shouldn't we?

197
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:30,150
It's on the way.
Maybe.

198
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:33,086
Yeah. "One last case
for the Winchester boys."

199
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:34,788
Don't --

200
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,456
You had to go there.

201
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,024
Okay, j-just...

202
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:40,427
There have been
at least two murders.

203
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:43,597
Uh, one was just tonight,
and the police reports say,

204
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:47,334
a couple days ago,
a woman drowned in, uh,

205
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:49,569
bloody,
red saltwater.

206
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:50,284
Like seawater?

207
00:14:50,308 --> 00:14:52,306
Yeah, except there's
no sea around here.

208
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:54,541
And then, tonight,
a guy had his throat slit.

209
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:56,343
Both bodies
were dumped in alleys.

210
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:58,178
The murders happened
somewhere else.

211
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,748
And both vics had
graffiti carved in them.

212
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,617
- "Graffiti"?
- That's what the cops said.

213
00:15:04,553 --> 00:15:07,220
But, uh...

214
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:08,555
it wasn't "graffiti."

215
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,594
- Enochian.
- Yeah.

216
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:19,366
- Yeah?
- Uh, sir, FBI.

217
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:22,002
We're here to talk to you
about your brother, Alan.

218
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:29,476
Oh. Well, definitely
brothers.

219
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:31,678
Uh, Alan was my twin.

220
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,812
I'm Eddie.

221
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:38,985
I can't believe
he's gone.

222
00:15:38,987 --> 00:15:41,688
We were close.

223
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,057
Best friends.

224
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:46,993
Alan always said
he was my "big brother,"

225
00:15:46,995 --> 00:15:48,662
'cause he was born first.

226
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:52,465
By, like, four minutes.

227
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:57,103
Losing him is like
losing a part of myself.

228
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:00,674
I never knew
it could be this bad.

229
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,678
Cops said your brother
was connected to, uh,

230
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,346
another victim.

231
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:08,214
Yeah, I-I know. Uh...

232
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:10,850
They both had that
graffiti carved in them.

233
00:16:10,852 --> 00:16:13,853
What kind of
monster does that?

234
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:16,423
A-Actually,
it wasn't, um...

235
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:19,059
It wasn't graffiti.
It was, uh...

236
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,594
It was
an ancient language.

237
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:23,263
It meant, um,

238
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:24,531
"I am the Word."

239
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,530
What?

240
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,494
Was your brother
a very religious man?

241
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:32,038
No. Not really.

242
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,240
Did he know
anyone who was?

243
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:36,943
Well, I mean, most of
the people we know, uh,

244
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:40,513
they're
Church on Easter types...

245
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:42,882
except --
- Except what?

246
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:45,685
There's this guy,
Tony Alvarez.

247
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:47,520
Him and Alan
were friends.

248
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:51,157
He was always quoting stuff
that sounded like

249
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:52,826
it came from the Bible.

250
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:58,198
Can I see
that paper again?

251
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,066
Of course.

252
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:07,007
This is Tony...

253
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:09,609
before he got too weird.

254
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,778
There, on his arm.

255
00:17:14,716 --> 00:17:16,549
It's Enochian.

256
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:19,652
It means "the Word."

257
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:28,428
A killer who reads
and writes Enochian?

258
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,130
M-Maybe some kind of
screwed-up angel?

259
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,831
I suppose Tony could have said
"yes" and gotten possessed,

260
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,466
but there aren't that many
angels around anymore.

261
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:35,702
Well, no, angels aren't the only
ones who know Enochian.

262
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:42,575
Dean! It's so good to hear from you.

263
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:45,245
Okay. Well. Good.

264
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:46,546
Uh
listen, Cass.

265
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:48,481
Uh, Sam and I are
working this case.

266
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:51,551
You're working a case?
That is so good to hear.

267
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:53,486
So I assume that means you're
not going through with it,

268
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:56,156
<i>because I have to say, Dean,</i>
<i>this plan of yours,</i>

269
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,725
<i>it was born of -- of</i>
<i>desperation, not reason.</i>

270
00:17:58,727 --> 00:17:59,709
My "plan"?

271
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:01,362
<i>I-I know that</i>
<i>I'm not supposed</i>

272
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:03,229
<i>to know</i>
<i>what I know, but...</i>

273
00:18:03,231 --> 00:18:04,697
Look, I'm fine
with my plan, okay?

274
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:06,933
<i>We can talk</i>
<i>about my plan later.</i>

275
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:08,368
Dean.

276
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,638
<i>You are making</i>
<i>a terrible mistake.</i>

277
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,807
Does the name "Tony Alvarez"
mean anything to you?

278
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:17,143
- Y-Yes.
- Say more.

279
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:19,946
Antonio Alvarez is --

280
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:23,349
is next in line to be prophet
when Donatello dies.

281
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,021
- Okay. Thanks, Cass.
- Wait, Dean, Dean.

282
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,589
<i>We need to have</i>
<i>a conversation.</i>

283
00:18:29,591 --> 00:18:31,091
Look, I really got to handle
this right now, okay?

284
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:33,860
So thank you, and, uh...

285
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,061
it's good
to hear your voice.

286
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:36,529
Dean?

287
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,599
- Really?
- Dean, it's Cass.

288
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:41,134
I had to tell him.

289
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:44,904
Well, it turns out
that Alan's friend Tony

290
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:46,306
is a killer prophet.

291
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:48,975
How's that
even possible?

292
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:52,579
I guess anyone
can be a prophet, right?

293
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:55,367
Not like there's a-a background
check or anything.

294
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,384
Yeah, but before one
reveals itself,

295
00:18:58,386 --> 00:19:01,121
the previous one
has to die.

296
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:02,722
So does that mean
Donatello's dead?

297
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:09,273
Dr. Rashad?

298
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:11,008
Hi. It's Dean Winchester.

299
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,010
Yes, yeah. We --
W-We've spoken before.

300
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:15,179
Uh, I'm Donatello Redfield's
nephew.

301
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:17,548
Yeah, how is --
how is Donatello?

302
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,450
He's, um...

303
00:19:19,452 --> 00:19:20,784
He's still
alive, right?

304
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:24,788
Uh-huh.

305
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,157
Well, Uncle Donny's
a fighter.

306
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:28,626
You keep
me posted, okay?

307
00:19:29,395 --> 00:19:31,262
He's still with us.

308
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:32,630
So, wait a second.

309
00:19:32,632 --> 00:19:34,398
I-If Donatello is still
technically online,

310
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,001
then -- then why is
Tony Alvarez off the bench?

311
00:19:37,904 --> 00:19:39,937
Let's ask him.

312
00:19:44,544 --> 00:19:46,143
Tony Alvarez?

313
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:17,374
Wow.

314
00:20:17,376 --> 00:20:20,277
Enochian 101.

315
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,947
Looks like a whole semester
of Prophet-speak.

316
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:34,124
Wow.

317
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:35,826
Hey, check this out.

318
00:20:35,828 --> 00:20:37,494
Are these
future vics?

319
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:42,032
I don't know.

320
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,767
But these
look familiar.

321
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:45,202
Hmm.

322
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:46,737
Well,
he likes souvenirs.

323
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:48,606
Explains how our lady Vic
drowned.

324
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:50,307
Look at this.

325
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:54,244
It's all "word of God"

326
00:20:54,246 --> 00:20:56,547
and
"divine retribution."

327
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:59,249
I-I mean, slaughter
of firstborn sons,

328
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:01,752
the -- the drowning of Egyptians
in the Red Sea...

329
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:05,356
Wait, wait, wait. So, Alan was
the oldest of the twin, right?

330
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:08,158
- Yeah.
- So firstborn.

331
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,594
- Of course.
- And then she died

332
00:21:10,596 --> 00:21:12,763
in salty, bloody water.

333
00:21:12,765 --> 00:21:14,898
The "red sea."

334
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,400
So then,
what's next up?

335
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:21,905
Hey, Dean.

336
00:21:24,377 --> 00:21:27,778
"And there went out fire from
the Lord and devoured them."

337
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:33,417
Hey, Sam.

338
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:36,320
Check this out.

339
00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:59,043
Hey. Y-You don't
have to do this.

340
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:07,651
You don't have
to do it.

341
00:22:11,624 --> 00:22:13,590
Whatever you what,
I'll give you anything.

342
00:22:16,195 --> 00:22:17,928
No!

343
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,396
Let me go, please!

344
00:22:19,398 --> 00:22:20,964
"And the son of Aaron offered
strange fire to the Lord..."

345
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,332
I'll do anything you want!

346
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:23,901
- "...which he commanded them not."
- No!

347
00:22:23,903 --> 00:22:26,470
"There went out fire from
the Lord and devoured him

348
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:28,439
and he died
before the Lord."

349
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:29,740
What are you doing?

350
00:22:29,742 --> 00:22:31,675
Come back!
Please, come on!

351
00:22:31,677 --> 00:22:34,011
Whatever you want,
I-I'll give you anything!

352
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:35,112
Please!

353
00:22:35,114 --> 00:22:36,980
The pain
becomes salvation.

354
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:39,249
What are you doing?
No, no, no!

355
00:22:45,024 --> 00:22:49,159
No!

356
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,438
Go on. Get out of here.
Go. Now.

357
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:05,342
Sam? Sam!

358
00:23:08,748 --> 00:23:11,348
Tony Alvarez, right?

359
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,649
And who are you?

360
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,354
You can't --
You can't do this.

361
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:19,623
I'm doing God's work.
I'm carrying out his orders.

362
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,024
You think
God spoke to you?

363
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:23,627
I-I've been chosen.
I hear his voice in my head.

364
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:25,295
Yeah?
What's he saying now?

365
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:31,702
Nothing.

366
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:34,004
Yeah. 'Cause whatever
you heard,

367
00:23:34,006 --> 00:23:35,272
it wasn't God.

368
00:23:35,274 --> 00:23:38,675
Those people you killed
were innocent.

369
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:41,478
Please!

370
00:23:42,615 --> 00:23:44,715
You're not chosen,
pal.

371
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:46,416
You're just a psycho.

372
00:23:49,755 --> 00:23:53,690
No.

373
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:55,192
So, what if he is hearing
something, right?

374
00:23:55,194 --> 00:23:56,660
I mean, what if, uh --
what if he's picking up

375
00:23:56,662 --> 00:23:58,962
some sort of vibe
from Donatello, you know?

376
00:23:58,964 --> 00:24:00,230
No, no...

377
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:02,166
- Donatello's out cold.
-No...

378
00:24:02,168 --> 00:24:03,667
Yeah, so we think --
he's out cold.

379
00:24:04,804 --> 00:24:07,304
No!
No, no, no.

380
00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:10,340
Ohh!

381
00:24:10,342 --> 00:24:12,075
Ohh!

382
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,779
He's got my gun!

383
00:24:15,781 --> 00:24:17,381
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

384
00:24:17,383 --> 00:24:18,949
No, no, no. Wait.

385
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:21,852
Stop. Hey, stop.
Stop, stop, stop.

386
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:25,489
- No, no, no!
- Wait --

387
00:24:46,545 --> 00:24:49,479
So, then, this might
not end with Tony Alvarez.

388
00:24:49,481 --> 00:24:51,982
Because the next prophet's
gonna show up somewhere,

389
00:24:51,984 --> 00:24:55,219
a-and -- and the crazy
could start all over again.

390
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:57,054
By the way, Cass...

391
00:24:57,056 --> 00:24:59,556
I thought there could only be
one prophet at a time.

392
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:01,191
<i>Yeah, there should,</i>

393
00:25:01,193 --> 00:25:04,294
but Donatello is between
life and death.

394
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:05,829
I mean, you know,
perhaps the next prophet

395
00:25:05,831 --> 00:25:07,664
was activated
before his time?

396
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:10,667
- And went all Hannibal?
- <i>The natural order's been upset.</i>

397
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:13,337
Perhaps Donatello's state
has created a prophet

398
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:16,406
who's not only premature...

399
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:17,875
but malformed.

400
00:25:17,877 --> 00:25:20,711
Okay. But if Tony was wired
wrong because of Donatello,

401
00:25:20,713 --> 00:25:23,146
then the next prophet
will be wired wrong, as well,

402
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:26,350
and then the next and the next
and the -- the next and...

403
00:25:26,352 --> 00:25:27,985
How do we end this?

404
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,625
You know how.

405
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:09,786
Nick?

406
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:15,158
Is that you?

407
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,728
Yes, Nick.

408
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:18,929
Lucifer?

409
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:23,467
Sarah.

410
00:27:25,738 --> 00:27:27,270
Your wife.

411
00:27:32,673 --> 00:27:34,272
Sarah?

412
00:27:34,674 --> 00:27:37,175
As in the ghost
of Sarah?

413
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:39,444
- Yes.
- I don't understand.

414
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:41,179
What -- What are you
doing here?

415
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:42,280
I never left.

416
00:27:42,282 --> 00:27:45,150
I'm held here
by unfinished business.

417
00:27:45,152 --> 00:27:46,479
Oh, my God.

418
00:27:46,503 --> 00:27:48,603
My unsolved murder,
and Teddy's.

419
00:27:48,688 --> 00:27:51,656
Sarah, I...

420
00:27:51,658 --> 00:27:52,924
I've missed you.

421
00:27:54,761 --> 00:27:58,530
I never thought
I'd see you again.

422
00:27:58,532 --> 00:28:00,064
I'm so sorry.

423
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:03,768
No, Nick.

424
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,403
You're not.

425
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,742
But I found who killed you,
Sarah.

426
00:28:10,744 --> 00:28:13,511
A cop --
Frank Kellogg.

427
00:28:13,513 --> 00:28:15,780
I mean, not a cop --
a demon.

428
00:28:15,782 --> 00:28:18,249
It's not Frank --
it's, uh, Abraxas.

429
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:20,452
Uh, it's confusing,
but I found him.

430
00:28:20,454 --> 00:28:22,921
I killed him.
It. Whatever.

431
00:28:22,923 --> 00:28:26,124
I got you justice, Sarah.

432
00:28:26,126 --> 00:28:28,760
You're free.
You could leave.

433
00:28:28,762 --> 00:28:30,495
And what about
Lucifer?

434
00:28:30,497 --> 00:28:32,664
What about him?
He's dead.

435
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:34,566
My unfinished
business

436
00:28:34,568 --> 00:28:36,534
isn't just about
how I died, Nick.

437
00:28:38,805 --> 00:28:40,171
It's<i> you.</i>

438
00:28:43,243 --> 00:28:45,143
I was here that night.

439
00:28:45,145 --> 00:28:47,078
I saw what
he did to you. I...

440
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:51,883
You chose Lucifer.

441
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,720
You wanted him.
You...

442
00:28:59,526 --> 00:29:02,026
You still do.

443
00:29:02,028 --> 00:29:05,029
He chose me, okay?

444
00:29:05,031 --> 00:29:08,766
You didn't come here
to find peace.

445
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:11,069
You came here
to find<i> him</i>

446
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:14,339
in the place where you
became one with him.

447
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:15,540
No.

448
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:17,242
Then show me I'm wrong.

449
00:29:17,244 --> 00:29:20,245
Reject Lucifer
right now.

450
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:23,014
If you do,
I can leave.

451
00:29:23,016 --> 00:29:25,049
I can find peace.

452
00:29:34,461 --> 00:29:36,094
Reject him, Nick.

453
00:29:41,635 --> 00:29:43,835
Please.

454
00:29:43,837 --> 00:29:45,203
Please!

455
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,908
I-I can't.

456
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:54,546
I'm sorry.

457
00:29:56,349 --> 00:29:58,316
You can't.

458
00:29:59,686 --> 00:30:02,453
Because you<i> are</i> him.

459
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:07,825
You doomed me
to stay in this place forever.

460
00:30:10,664 --> 00:30:13,932
You've doomed yourself.

461
00:30:13,934 --> 00:30:15,733
I know.

462
00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:21,306
I'm sorry.

463
00:30:24,778 --> 00:30:26,177
Where are you
going?

464
00:30:29,749 --> 00:30:32,116
Wherever it's darkest.

465
00:30:32,118 --> 00:30:33,618
Wherever he is.

466
00:30:36,189 --> 00:30:37,789
Nick!

467
00:30:44,998 --> 00:30:47,532
Dr. - You're making the right choice.

468
00:30:47,534 --> 00:30:49,934
Your uncle's in a persistent
vegetative state,

469
00:30:49,936 --> 00:30:53,705
being kept alive by machinery
and nothing else.

470
00:30:53,707 --> 00:30:56,441
Sometimes letting go
is the right choice.

471
00:30:57,944 --> 00:30:59,444
Tell me about it.

472
00:30:59,446 --> 00:31:02,447
Just coincidental, you all
being here at the same time.

473
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:06,317
Dr. Novak,
meet, uh --

474
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,518
Yes, I know.

475
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,953
I know these gentlemen.

476
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:12,790
Mr. Winchester
and the other Mr. Winchester.

477
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:15,393
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

478
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:16,928
So, Dr. Rashad,
you were saying

479
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,631
there's been no improvement
with our uncle?

480
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:23,067
That's right. There's no real
brain activity to speak of.

481
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:26,070
Um, nothing beyond
the occasional muscle spasm

482
00:31:26,072 --> 00:31:27,605
or, uh,
babble of words.

483
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:30,875
Strictly reflexive.

484
00:31:30,877 --> 00:31:32,710
W-What kind of
babbled word?

485
00:31:32,712 --> 00:31:34,178
Follow me.

486
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,884
So, "Doctor," checking in
on old Uncle Donny, huh?

487
00:31:39,886 --> 00:31:41,419
Hey, Dean.

488
00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:43,821
What happened to him --
that was my fault.

489
00:31:43,823 --> 00:31:44,989
It was necessary.

490
00:31:44,991 --> 00:31:46,624
But doesn't mean
I don't regret it.

491
00:31:46,626 --> 00:31:47,859
It doesn't mean that
I don't wish that

492
00:31:47,861 --> 00:31:49,761
there could've been
another way.

493
00:31:49,763 --> 00:31:51,362
I know the feeling.

494
00:31:51,364 --> 00:31:52,697
Oh, no.

495
00:31:52,699 --> 00:31:54,899
No, please
don't compare this

496
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:57,435
with your
suicidal plan.

497
00:31:57,437 --> 00:31:59,037
- Just stop.
-Okay. All right.

498
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,471
Why don't we
talk about that later?

499
00:32:00,473 --> 00:32:02,473
Because,
according to your plan,

500
00:32:02,475 --> 00:32:04,609
there won't be a later.

501
00:32:04,611 --> 00:32:08,212
Cass...if you were
a friend of mine,

502
00:32:08,214 --> 00:32:09,847
then you will understand
that I have to do this

503
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:11,916
and you won't
try to stop me.

504
00:32:11,918 --> 00:32:14,752
You think
this is easy on me?

505
00:32:14,754 --> 00:32:16,354
It has to be done.

506
00:32:16,356 --> 00:32:19,057
So, then,
this is goodbye?

507
00:32:21,928 --> 00:32:23,695
Guys.

508
00:32:23,697 --> 00:32:25,296
Check this out.

509
00:32:25,298 --> 00:32:27,198
Okay, so, a couple days ago,
Donatello started making

510
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,500
some, uh,
random noises.

511
00:32:29,502 --> 00:32:31,869
Uh, Dr. Rashad thought
he might be coming out of it,

512
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:34,405
so he shot this video.

513
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:38,910
<i>Boh ray,</i>
<i>kah lah teh nee hoh.</i>

514
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:42,346
<i>Rah may lah ray kee doh.</i>

515
00:32:42,348 --> 00:32:44,182
That's Enochian.

516
00:32:44,184 --> 00:32:45,650
He's saying,
"I will strike down

517
00:32:45,652 --> 00:32:48,486
the firstborn
in the land of Egypt.

518
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:50,154
I-I will execute
judgment."

519
00:32:50,156 --> 00:32:51,522
Well, that's
the same thing that

520
00:32:51,524 --> 00:32:53,291
that screwed-up
new prophet was spouting.

521
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:56,861
Donatello's mind
is fighting to rebuild.

522
00:32:56,863 --> 00:33:00,531
It's -- It's like he's trying
to organize his...

523
00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:02,633
his memories,
the words of God.

524
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:05,603
So that's what Tony
was picking up on.

525
00:33:05,605 --> 00:33:08,239
Well, then,
I-I can fix him.

526
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:10,241
Wait. How?
I thought he was too far gone.

527
00:33:10,243 --> 00:33:13,411
Dean,
if there's a spark --

528
00:33:13,413 --> 00:33:17,014
a hope --
then I have to try.

529
00:33:17,016 --> 00:33:18,516
<i>You</i> taught me that.

530
00:33:22,021 --> 00:33:23,755
Get out.

531
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:25,356
What?

532
00:33:25,358 --> 00:33:26,657
You heard him.

533
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:28,459
You said you wanted
to discontinue treatments.

534
00:33:28,461 --> 00:33:29,827
And now we've changed
our minds.

535
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:31,462
Look, if there's a chance
that Donatello

536
00:33:31,464 --> 00:33:33,197
could fight through this,
then we're gonna take it.

537
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:35,399
He ain't leaving the party
if the music's still playing.

538
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:36,400
Clear?

539
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,110
You all right?

540
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:52,650
If Cass isn't right
about Donatello,

541
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:54,452
then where does
that leave him?

542
00:33:54,454 --> 00:33:55,553
Trapped.

543
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:56,788
Trapped
in his own body

544
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,723
somewhere between
life and death.

545
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,561
It's just tough to think about
somebody going through that.

546
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:05,663
Then don't.

547
00:34:05,665 --> 00:34:08,132
Thinking --
highly overrated.

548
00:34:08,134 --> 00:34:09,567
Easy for you
to say.

549
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:11,536
No, it's not,
actually.

550
00:34:11,538 --> 00:34:14,138
Whatever's gonna happen with
Donatello, we'll know soon.

551
00:34:17,377 --> 00:34:19,410
Right.

552
00:34:19,412 --> 00:34:20,745
And then what?

553
00:34:22,749 --> 00:34:25,416
Nothing's changed, Sam.

554
00:34:37,564 --> 00:34:39,030
Hey.

555
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,532
Anything?

556
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:45,403
Something.

557
00:34:45,405 --> 00:34:47,138
Something uncertain.

558
00:34:48,474 --> 00:34:50,775
Well, what exactly
are you looking for?

559
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:58,082
That.

560
00:34:58,084 --> 00:34:59,383
Donatello?

561
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:06,557
We should turn off
these machines.

562
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:08,059
Whoa. Wait, wait.

563
00:35:10,263 --> 00:35:11,429
He could die.

564
00:35:11,431 --> 00:35:13,130
There's only one way
to find out.

565
00:35:54,774 --> 00:35:56,674
Hey.

566
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:58,676
Welcome back, champ.

567
00:35:58,678 --> 00:36:00,311
Dean?

568
00:36:00,313 --> 00:36:01,979
Get him his glasses.

569
00:36:11,124 --> 00:36:13,291
Now, look at that.

570
00:36:15,328 --> 00:36:16,961
It's a miracle.

571
00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:29,035
Um...

572
00:36:29,037 --> 00:36:31,571
Would you like
more grape Jell-O?

573
00:36:31,573 --> 00:36:33,473
Well, a-actually,
I'd prefer

574
00:36:33,475 --> 00:36:35,308
a bucket of extra-crispy
buffalo wings

575
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,776
with a side
of Tex-Mex sauce.

576
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:40,747
Okay. Take it easy, cowboy.
You just got back.

577
00:36:41,716 --> 00:36:43,549
He<i> is</i> back,
isn't he?

578
00:36:43,551 --> 00:36:46,819
I mean, this isn't some kind
of evil, weird version?

579
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:49,622
No. This is the --
the regular him.

580
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,924
But, um...he --

581
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:53,726
he -- he doesn't
have a soul.

582
00:36:53,728 --> 00:36:54,694
Hm.

583
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:56,863
Well,
nobody's perfect.

584
00:36:56,865 --> 00:36:58,731
Guys, w-what happened?

585
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:01,701
Did I work too much?
Overload on Enochian?

586
00:37:01,703 --> 00:37:02,902
Hm.

587
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:06,272
Cass will
catch you up.

588
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,245
Jell-O?

589
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:23,189
Where's the party?

590
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:25,758
It's right here.

591
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,427
I mean, we're celebrating,
right?

592
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:31,564
- Okay.
- Yeah, but not too much.

593
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:34,300
Tomorrow morning,
we're, uh, back on track.

594
00:37:34,302 --> 00:37:37,003
No rest for
the self-destructive.

595
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:41,407
Well, I would
call this a win.

596
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:44,510
Kind of nice.
We're going out on a high.

597
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,213
"Going out" being
the operative phrase.

598
00:37:47,215 --> 00:37:48,281
Sorry.

599
00:37:48,283 --> 00:37:49,982
"Sorry."

600
00:37:49,984 --> 00:37:51,317
How sorry are you?

601
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:53,886
Sorry that you fight
to keep Donatello alive,

602
00:37:53,888 --> 00:37:55,655
but when it
comes to you,

603
00:37:55,657 --> 00:37:57,423
you just
throw in the towel?

604
00:37:58,927 --> 00:38:01,127
Or are you sorry that,
after all these years,

605
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:04,263
our entire lives,
a-after I've looked up to you,

606
00:38:04,265 --> 00:38:08,301
after I've learned from you,
I-I-I've copied you,

607
00:38:08,303 --> 00:38:10,603
I followed you
to Hell and back,

608
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:11,938
are you sorry
that all of that --

609
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,306
it -- it --
it means nothing now?

610
00:38:13,308 --> 00:38:15,508
- Who's saying that?
-You are,

611
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:18,077
when you tell me
I have to kill you.

612
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,447
When you're telling me
that I have to just throw away

613
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:23,516
everything we stand for,

614
00:38:23,518 --> 00:38:26,953
throw away faith,
throw away family.

615
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:30,156
We're the guys
who save the world.

616
00:38:30,158 --> 00:38:32,492
We don't just
check out of it!

617
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:37,864
Sam, I have
tried everything.

618
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:39,799
Everything!

619
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:42,568
I got one card left to play,
and I have to play it.

620
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,904
You have
one card<i> today!</i>

621
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,472
But we'll find
another tomorrow.

622
00:38:46,474 --> 00:38:49,408
But if you quit on us today,
there won't be no tomorrow!

623
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,145
You tell me, uh, you don't know
what else to do.

624
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:54,413
I don't either, Dean.
Not yet.

625
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,183
But what you're doing now,
i-it's -- it's wrong!

626
00:38:57,185 --> 00:38:58,751
It's quitting!

627
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:02,655
I mean, l-look
what just happened.

628
00:39:02,657 --> 00:39:04,657
Donatello never
quit fighting.

629
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:07,026
So we could help him
because he gave up.

630
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,766
<i>I</i> believe
in us, Dean.

631
00:39:21,476 --> 00:39:23,543
I believe in us.

632
00:39:23,545 --> 00:39:25,378
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

633
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:30,650
Why don't you
believe in us, too?

634
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:42,695
Okay, Sam.

635
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:49,168
Let's go home.

636
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,536
What?

637
00:40:00,114 --> 00:40:01,447
Let's go home.

638
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:06,485
Maybe
Billie's wrong.

639
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,687
Maybe.

640
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:11,624
But I do
believe in us.

641
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,363
I believe
in all of us.

642
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:23,569
And I'll keep believing
until I can't.

643
00:40:24,873 --> 00:40:26,973
Until there's absolutely
no other way.

644
00:40:32,814 --> 00:40:34,280
But when
that day comes --

645
00:40:34,282 --> 00:40:37,183
<i>if</i> that day comes...

646
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:41,921
...Sam, you have to take it
for what it is --

647
00:40:41,923 --> 00:40:43,122
the end.

648
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,628
And you have
to promise me

649
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,697
that you'll do then
what you can't do now,

650
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,066
and that's let me go.

651
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:55,835
And put me
in that box.

652
00:40:58,072 --> 00:40:59,372
You, too.

653
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,847
Yeah, all right.
All right.

654
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:09,115
All right.

655
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,520
Now, you heard me.
Let's go home.

656
00:41:15,423 --> 00:41:17,957
Just don't hit me
again, okay?
