1
00:00:01,011 --> 00:00:02,011
Impossible odds.

2
00:00:04,247 --> 00:00:05,380
Walking right into
a trap.

3
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:08,549
Feels like home.

4
00:00:09,786 --> 00:00:11,152
Michael conned me.

5
00:00:11,154 --> 00:00:13,488
Kept me trapped and drowning
inside my own body.

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,356
I own you.

7
00:00:15,358 --> 00:00:16,991
And he's out there
hurting people.

8
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:20,428
His name. Gadreel.

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,896
I have Sam locked away
in a dream.

10
00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:23,398
Say "Poughkeepsie."

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,032
It's our go word. It means
"drop everything and run."

12
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:26,701
Get...out!

13
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:29,769
I know this must be
so hard without your grace.

14
00:00:32,108 --> 00:00:33,808
Jack!

15
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,176
Please don't be sad.

16
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:38,212
Maybe this is how
things are supposed to be.

17
00:00:38,214 --> 00:00:39,747
He's gone.

18
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:42,183
Here's to you, Jack.

19
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:44,986
My magic draws power
from the human soul.

20
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:45,953
It could save him.

21
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:47,422
If Jack is in Heaven,

22
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:50,825
I might be able to pull
his soul into his body.

23
00:00:52,362 --> 00:00:54,061
With the spear
still in play,

24
00:00:54,063 --> 00:00:56,531
could be a shot at actually
killing the son of a bitch.

25
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:01,402
No.

26
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:04,005
When I gave up Dean,
you didn't think to question?

27
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:05,773
This time, he is buried.

28
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:06,874
And now...

29
00:01:06,876 --> 00:01:08,943
I have a whole army
out there,

30
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,311
ready for my command.

31
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,795
? I rode into town today ?

32
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:31,966
? In my mind, I said,
"Lord, I'd love to stay" ?

33
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:36,204
? Something in me said,
"Boy, move on" ?

34
00:01:36,206 --> 00:01:39,507
That weather.
? Don't know what it is ?

35
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,577
? The good Lord bred it in my bones ?
Not even playing around.

36
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:45,213
? And I'm searchin'
for a rainbow ?

37
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:47,882
Everybody's shopping at the
store like it's the End Days.

38
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:50,284
The milk and bread aisles
were a war zone.

39
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:55,154
But I battled through it all
for your stupid bag of limes.

40
00:01:55,155 --> 00:01:57,831
? You'll be waiting at the end,
and I know ?

41
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:00,300
Hey, I'm not makin' the house
special without the limes.

42
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:02,169
What are we -- savages?

43
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:03,671
Well...

44
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:07,708
? I'd see the hill
with that pot of gold ?

45
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,479
Tequila shot and a beer.
Best damn house special ever.

46
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:14,782
? This old mount I'm ridin',
she's gettin' kinda tired ?
No complaints here.

47
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:16,913
? But in my heart, she knows
there's this one desire ?

48
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,937
Whoo! Mmm.

49
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:22,356
? She's gonna take me to the end of our road ?
Is there any word from Sam?

50
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:24,291
Still working that ghoul thing
in Wichita with Cass.

51
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:26,326
They should be back tonight.
? Then she'll lay down and die ?

52
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:29,396
? And I'll say, "God rest her soul" ?

53
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:32,766
? And I'm searchin'
for a rainbow ?

54
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,438
Wet one out there, eh?

55
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,906
Yes.

56
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,741
And you are...?

57
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,042
Pamela Barnes.

58
00:02:42,044 --> 00:02:44,211
Waitress, hostess,
Ouija board enthusiast.

59
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:46,413
- We met the last time you stopped by --
- Oh! Mr. Winchester.

60
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:47,881
And the time before that.

61
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:50,851
I brought the papers
I mentioned.

62
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:52,720
I know you said
you weren't interested,

63
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:55,622
but it's just a few signatures
and you could --

64
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:58,025
Can I get you a drink?

65
00:02:58,027 --> 00:02:59,626
I'm in a bit of a rush.

66
00:03:01,163 --> 00:03:03,197
Well, sorry you wasted
your trip out here,

67
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,534
but, um...Rocky's
still isn't for sale.

68
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:11,805
Rocky's
looks pretty dead.

69
00:03:11,807 --> 00:03:13,874
It's a very generous offer.

70
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:17,544
Well, all the same,
this bar?

71
00:03:17,546 --> 00:03:20,481
I've never had
anything this nice.

72
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:22,316
So that sale
that you want so bad,

73
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:24,451
well, it's just not
gonna happen.

74
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:32,860
Need to borrow an umbrella?

75
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:38,665
? And I'm searchin'
for a rainbow ?

76
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:45,339
Mm-hmm.

77
00:03:46,408 --> 00:03:47,708
You just gonna leave
the drunk guy

78
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,176
out there
with all the booze?

79
00:03:49,178 --> 00:03:51,378
What, you mean
that unconscious drunk guy?

80
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,880
Yeah, I am.

81
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:54,047
Do a shot with me.

82
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:55,382
I'm heading out
for a hot date.

83
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:57,985
How come you always
have a boyfriend?

84
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,387
How come you only want
what you can't have?

85
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:02,256
Whoa.

86
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:06,193
Besides, you don't want me.
You just like to flirt.

87
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:07,928
I'm a psychic,
so I kinda know.

88
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,364
All right.

89
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,971
So, still not ready
to sell the bar, huh?

90
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:20,040
It's a lot of money.

91
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:22,409
Sell? This bar?

92
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:25,112
This is my dream.

93
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,715
Yeah.

94
00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:35,255
Dean?

95
00:04:35,257 --> 00:04:36,790
You wanna come out here?

96
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:41,161
? I rode into town today ?

97
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,630
What's up?

98
00:04:43,632 --> 00:04:46,133
? In my mind, I said,
"Lord, I'd love to stay" ?

99
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:47,968
Trouble.

100
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,303
What kind of trouble?

101
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:52,139
? Something in me said,
"Boy, move on" ?

102
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:53,307
That kind.

103
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:58,946
Dean Winchester?

104
00:04:58,948 --> 00:05:00,214
Yeah?

105
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,050
I got a score
to settle with you.

106
00:05:04,453 --> 00:05:07,354
You and your brother
killed my entire nest

107
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:08,689
back in Sudler.

108
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:12,526
Is that right?

109
00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:33,947
Nice.

110
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:38,418
- Whoo.
- Oh.

111
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:43,490
What you got?

112
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:46,460
Worst part of working here is
having to clean up the blood

113
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:50,264
after some pissed-off monster
busts in to kill you.

114
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,567
? And I'm searchin' for a rainbow ?
Well, what can I say?

115
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:55,068
I'm famous.

116
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,070

118
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:08,315
Now, this...
just feels right.

119
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:16,623
Hope is an amazing thing, isn't it?

120
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:21,361
You had no chance
of winning this.

121
00:06:21,363 --> 00:06:22,663
None.

122
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:26,667
But you had hope --

123
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:28,568
hope that I wouldn't
see you coming,

124
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,306
but I saw everything.

125
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,740
It'll be the end of him.

126
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:35,042
Ketch says
he'll set up a meeting.

127
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:36,610
Jack! - Jack!

128
00:06:36,612 --> 00:06:39,579
And now I have
my perfect vessel.

129
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:41,281
I've just destroyed
the one weapon

130
00:06:41,283 --> 00:06:44,251
that could really hurt me.

131
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:45,953
Thanks for bringing that,
by the way.

132
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:50,390
Don't interrupt me.

133
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,174
You think these
can hold me?

134
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:12,179
Yes, we do.

135
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,881
Dean.
Come on, Dean.

136
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:16,216
Are you in there?

137
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,653
Dean's not home
right now.

138
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:21,221
Please leave a message.

139
00:07:23,392 --> 00:07:25,559
Oh, right. That.

140
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:27,194
Did you forget?

141
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:30,297
My monsters are out there,
building an army.

142
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,808
Maggie? Hey.
What's happening out there?

143
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,944
I brought every hunter
I could find, like you said,

144
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:46,213
and we're trying to track down
the monsters,

145
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,416
but, uh,
there's so many of them.

146
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:52,753
We're getting reports
of attacks all over the city.

147
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:55,589
No kills, just bites
or scratches.

148
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:57,290
<i>It's like they're</i>
<i>trying to infect --</i>

149
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:59,526
- Yeah, I know.
- <i>Sam, where are you?</i>

150
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:01,428
Top of Hitomi Plaza,
10th and Main.

151
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,030
- We've got Michael.
- Do you?

152
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:04,598
<i>Okay, we'll get there</i>
<i>as soon as we can.</i>

153
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,334
No, no, no, just save
as many people as you can.

154
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:09,436
Don't worry about us.
We'll figure it out.

155
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:15,342
- Thanks.
- Okay, what's the plan?

156
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:17,477
With the angel cuffs on,
Michael's under control.

157
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:19,079
Keep telling yourself
that.

158
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,715
Get him downstairs, dump him
in the trunk of the Impala,

159
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:23,083
and take him
back to the bunker.

160
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,584
But Garth is in the trunk.

161
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,554
It's a big trunk.

162
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:34,561
Monsters!

163
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:36,329
More like the Calvary.

164
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:40,233
I called them.

165
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:43,904
It's a party.

166
00:08:43,906 --> 00:08:46,173
Sam, I don't know how long
I can hold them.

167
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:47,841
Yeah, well, we have to
get Dean out of here.

168
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:49,176
Yeah, well,
we can't go this way.

169
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:51,111
It's not like
any of us can fly.

170
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,846
- Well, one of us can.
- Shut up!

171
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:54,815
Sam, are we gonna
die here?

172
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:06,226
Jessica?

173
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:08,028
You said you're
always here, right?

174
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,496
Sam, what are you doing?

175
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:13,066
Billie -- uh, uh,
Death assigned a reaper

176
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:14,534
to keep an eye
on Dean and me.

177
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:16,303
Her name is Jessica,
and she is always --

178
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,437
Hello.

179
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:21,108
Where's Jessica?

180
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,710
Well, my name's Violet.
It's my shift.

181
00:09:23,712 --> 00:09:24,978
We have shifts now,

182
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,347
because you mess up so,
so many things.

183
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:31,818
Sturdy door.

184
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,054
Okay, all right. Well, Violet,
we have to get out of here.

185
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:35,322
And I want you
to know that

186
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,756
you have
my full emotional support.

187
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:38,191
W-We don't want
your emotional support.

188
00:09:38,193 --> 00:09:40,260
We -- We want your actual,
physical help.

189
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:42,496
Sam, who are you talking to?

190
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,830
You can't see her?

191
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,167
I can.

192
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,535
You know, in my world,

193
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:51,638
we locked Death away
and enslave the reapers.

194
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,107
Lovely. Well,
just look at you now.

195
00:09:54,109 --> 00:09:55,675
Okay, look, sorry,
but we're stuck, okay?

196
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:56,843
And Death owes us one

197
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:58,044
after we fixed
that whole Rowena thing.

198
00:09:58,046 --> 00:09:59,412
You know about that, right?

199
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:02,149
Oh, yes, the Rowena thing
<i>you</i> started.

200
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,851
We're gonna die here.

201
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:08,088
- And my brother --
- Reapers can't intervene -- and rules.

202
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,489
Don't give me that whole
clean hands --

203
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:10,957
Even if I did
feel inclined, uh,

204
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,459
we don't have access
to that kind of --

205
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:14,427
- Yeah, well, uh --
- Shh, shh.

206
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:17,631
Sam, what is she saying?

207
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:22,035
She's not saying
anything.

208
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:23,036
Okay.

209
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:24,104
What?

210
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:31,144
How did you do that?

211
00:10:31,146 --> 00:10:32,846
I, uh, didn't.

212
00:10:34,082 --> 00:10:35,382
Have fun.

213
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:43,823
Now what?

214
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:57,337
Shouldn't we put him in
the dungeon or something?

215
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:58,838
Jack's right --
we don't know

216
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,407
how long those cuffs
are gonna hold.

217
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,908
I mean, Bobby improved them,
but --

218
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,945
If those cuffs won't hold him,
neither will the dungeon.

219
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:07,013
I can hear you.

220
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:11,251
Really?

221
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:15,222
Okay, so, what?

222
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:17,557
Okay, listen.
Back when Gadreel possessed me,

223
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,259
he -- he created,
uh, I don't know,

224
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,361
like a -- like a fake world
inside my head.

225
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:23,163
But Crowley was able
to force his way in,

226
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:24,397
he showed me
how to take control,

227
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,433
and I drove the angel out.

228
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,768
The problem is...
Crowley's dead.

229
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,070
Yeah.

230
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:31,504
Okay, so...

231
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:35,141
Sorry. It's Maggie.

232
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:36,068
Hey.

233
00:11:36,092 --> 00:11:38,012
Sam, we're almost
at Hitomi Plaza.

234
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:39,346
A-All right, uh,
yeah, we're, uh --

235
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:40,847
we're actually
back at the bunker.

236
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:41,535
What?!

237
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,017
Yeah, long story.
I'll explain later.

238
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:45,485
Uh, Maggie, we, uh --
we left Garth in the trunk

239
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:47,220
of the Impala
back at Hitomi Plaza.

240
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:48,521
<i>Can you make sure</i>
<i>he's okay?</i>

241
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:50,724
Okay, but, Sam,
the monsters --

242
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:52,826
they've stopped
attacking people.

243
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:55,028
- What?
- <i>Looks like they're leaving the city.</i>

244
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,129
<i>They're heading west.</i>

245
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:57,998
Remind me, Castiel --

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,400
we're west
of Kansas City now?

247
00:12:00,402 --> 00:12:02,168
You're bringing
them here?

248
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,403
You think?

249
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:06,139
Jack,
let's lock it down.

250
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:10,577
Yes, uh, put a chair against the door.

251
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,145
That'll help.

252
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:15,815
Nothing's changed.

253
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:18,051
Either my monsters get here

254
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:20,720
or I break these chains.

255
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:24,157
But tonight...
everybody dies.

256
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:26,593
And, Sam?

257
00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:29,195
The last thing you'll see

258
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:31,498
is this pretty smile...

259
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:34,567
...as I rip you apart.

260
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,924
What is that?

261
00:12:46,926 --> 00:12:48,258
It's the, uh,

262
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,260
messed up
British Men of Letters thing

263
00:12:50,262 --> 00:12:52,029
they used to get
inside people's heads.

264
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:54,531
I figure if I can get in,
maybe I can wake Dean up,

265
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:56,900
get him to fight, you know,
to force Michael out.

266
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:01,872
If he can.

267
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:03,140
Yeah.

268
00:13:04,376 --> 00:13:06,577
Cass, this is
all we got.

269
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,915
Any word from Sam?

270
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:15,252
Still working that ghoul thing
in Wichita with Cass.

271
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:16,720
They should be back tonight.

272
00:13:16,722 --> 00:13:18,255
Ohh!

273
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:24,728
Ha!

274
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,863
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

275
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:27,731
- Ha! Oh!
- More shots!

276
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,575
Oh! Mr. Winchester.

277
00:13:38,577 --> 00:13:40,911
? I rode into town today ?

278
00:13:40,913 --> 00:13:42,946
I brought those papers
I mentioned.

279
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,715
I know you said
you weren't interested,

280
00:13:44,717 --> 00:13:47,117
but it's just a few signatures
and you could --

281
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,186
Can I get you a drink?

282
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:52,389
I'm in a bit of a rush,
so if you could...?

283
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:55,659
Any word from Sam?

284
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,796
Still working that ghoul thing
in Wichita with Cass.

285
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:00,497
They should be back tonight.

286
00:14:12,044 --> 00:14:13,343
Nice.

287
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:16,413
Any word from Sam?

288
00:14:16,415 --> 00:14:19,516
Still working that ghoul thing
in Wichita with Cass.

289
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:22,119
They should be back tonight.

290
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:23,287
Huh.

291
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:27,691
? I rode into town today ?
What's up?

292
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:29,426
Just had some serious
d?j? vu.

293
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:31,094
? In my mind, I said,
"Lord, I'd --" ?

294
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:34,965
So, they left you
to keep an eye on me?

295
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:38,702
Gotta say,
little insulting.

296
00:14:38,704 --> 00:14:41,071
I mean, what are you?

297
00:14:41,073 --> 00:14:42,339
You're nothing.

298
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,908
That's not what
you said before.

299
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,643
Ah. Yes.

300
00:14:46,645 --> 00:14:49,379
A moment of
familial weakness.

301
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:52,049
- It won't happen again.
- It doesn't matter.

302
00:14:53,786 --> 00:14:56,286
Sam and Dean --

303
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:58,889
they're gonna
beat you.

304
00:14:58,891 --> 00:15:00,924
Oh, please.

305
00:15:00,926 --> 00:15:04,228
Sam's in so far over his head,
he's drowning.

306
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,395
And Dean?

307
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:08,465
Well, I've got Dean
under control.

308
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:10,367
No.

309
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,469
Dean --

310
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:14,104
he's strong.

311
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:16,540
He's a gnat.

312
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,242
I'm a god.

313
00:15:18,244 --> 00:15:19,943
Who would you bet on?

314
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:24,248
You don't know anything
about Dean.

315
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,784
I'm in his head...
literally.

316
00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:30,220
I know everything.

317
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:35,492
Like, I know how sad he was
when you died...

318
00:15:35,494 --> 00:15:38,195
on the outside.

319
00:15:38,197 --> 00:15:40,530
On the inside, well,

320
00:15:40,532 --> 00:15:42,900
it's not that
he was happy --

321
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:45,903
he just didn't care.

322
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:47,971
'Cause you're not Sam.

323
00:15:47,973 --> 00:15:49,706
You're not Cass.

324
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:53,577
You're a new burden
that he was handed.

325
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:58,215
You're a weak,
helpless thing.

326
00:15:58,217 --> 00:16:01,385
You think that
they care about you,

327
00:16:01,387 --> 00:16:03,320
love you?

328
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:05,822
You're a job,

329
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:08,792
a job none of them
wanted.

330
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:10,360
- And you --
- Jack?

331
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:18,535
Go help Sam.

332
00:16:18,537 --> 00:16:19,703
Wait.

333
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:25,509
Don't believe
anything he says.

334
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:26,743
He's lying.

335
00:16:26,745 --> 00:16:28,445
No, I'm not.

336
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:30,948
And I can still
hear you.

337
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:39,489
<i>Maggie? Maggie?</i>
<i>You there?</i>

338
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:40,595
Yeah?

339
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:42,060
<i>A group of them</i>
<i>got out in front of us,</i>

340
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:44,161
<i>headed your way</i>
<i>in a black van.</i>

341
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:46,363
Right. We'll be ready.

342
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:52,102
Okay. We've, uh, got some heavy
hitters coming through soon.

343
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:54,171
And...

344
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:55,839
And Sam needs our help.

345
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:59,309
You all know what the
Winchesters have done for us.

346
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:02,346
- They gave us all a second chance.
- Maggie?

347
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:09,553
Whatever happens,

348
00:17:09,555 --> 00:17:11,955
we can't let the monsters
get back to the bunker.

349
00:17:18,564 --> 00:17:20,897
Look at you.

350
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:24,568
Playing nursemaid
to an nephilim.

351
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,104
Nothing like
the Castiel I knew.

352
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:30,607
He would've never been
so...anemic.

353
00:17:32,044 --> 00:17:36,079
You're confusing loyalty
and compassion with weakness.

354
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:39,516
Tell me.

355
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:43,120
Why do you love this world
enough to risk your own life?

356
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:44,521
Tell me.

357
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:48,925
Why do you hate this world
enough to burn it to the ground?

358
00:17:48,927 --> 00:17:50,594
Because I can.

359
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,197
Because...

360
00:17:59,138 --> 00:18:03,340
Me and my brother --
my Lucifer --

361
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:06,710
when we fought
in my world,

362
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:09,846
we thought that God
would come back,

363
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:11,548
give us answers --

364
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,918
why He'd gone,
what we'd done --

365
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,188
but, instead,
do you know what happened?

366
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,723
Nothing.

367
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,294
No God.

368
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:26,063
Nothing.

369
00:18:26,598 --> 00:18:27,631
And now...

370
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:31,668
now that I'm in here --

371
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,403
now I know why.

372
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:38,642
God -- Chuck --

373
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:39,910
is a writer,

374
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,878
and like all writers,

375
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,616
He churns out
draft after draft.

376
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:51,254
My world? This world?

377
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,957
Nothing
but failed drafts.

378
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:57,360
And when He realizes
that they're flawed,

379
00:18:57,362 --> 00:19:01,098
He moves on
and tries again.

380
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,135
No, that's not how...

381
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,605
Why would He do that?

382
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:11,942
Because He doesn't care!

383
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:17,380
About you, me --
anything.

384
00:19:17,382 --> 00:19:21,785
Now, at first, I thought
I'd do it better.

385
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:23,186
Show Him.

386
00:19:23,188 --> 00:19:25,956
Be more God than God.

387
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,026
But now...

388
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:33,897
I just want to burn
every one of His little worlds

389
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:38,368
until I catch up
to the old man.

390
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,870
And then what?

391
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:45,976
Even God can die.

392
00:19:50,716 --> 00:19:52,182
Hey, you in there!

393
00:19:52,184 --> 00:19:54,017
We've got you surrounded!

394
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:56,186
- "We have you surrounded"?
- Shut up!

395
00:19:56,188 --> 00:19:57,687
Smithy, what do you see?

396
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:01,625
No movement.

397
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:03,493
Tiger, how about you?

398
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:06,396
They're gone.

399
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:12,669
There's some tracks here.

400
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,006
Don't go in there alone!

401
00:20:27,286 --> 00:20:28,785
They're on foot.
They went around us.

402
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:30,754
They're probably heading
for the bunker.

403
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:41,598
This...
is it going to work?

404
00:20:43,168 --> 00:20:44,901
I don't know.

405
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:50,040
Well, if it doesn't, maybe
there's something I can do.

406
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:54,778
The magic that's
keeping me alive,

407
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,581
what if I can do more?

408
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,549
And burn off your soul?

409
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:02,452
Not all of it.

410
00:21:02,454 --> 00:21:04,621
Jack.

411
00:21:04,623 --> 00:21:09,059
Dean wouldn't want to be saved,
not that way.

412
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:11,728
You don't know what
you're walking into.

413
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:14,397
Last time Dean
was possessed,

414
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:17,300
he said it felt like
he was drowning.

415
00:21:17,302 --> 00:21:18,668
This time...

416
00:21:20,939 --> 00:21:22,038
What?

417
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,840
It'll probably
be worse.

418
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:36,753
Cool science project.

419
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:39,923
I give it a solid B-minus.

420
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:43,693
Okay, in theory, I should be
connected to Dean's mind.

421
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:45,862
Cass, you should be able to
hitch a ride with me.

422
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,200
Oh, Cass...

423
00:21:50,202 --> 00:21:52,002
I believe in you.

424
00:21:56,675 --> 00:21:58,875
What should I do?

425
00:21:58,877 --> 00:22:00,110
Pray.

426
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:02,178
And make sure
no one kills us.

427
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:05,882
Well, I like this plan.

428
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:08,718
See, out here,
I'm all chained up.

429
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,820
But in there...

430
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:12,455
you're all mine.

431
00:22:15,427 --> 00:22:18,595
So...what are
we waiting for?

432
00:22:40,118 --> 00:22:42,419
Cass...

433
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:44,587
where are we?

434
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:46,489
In Dean's mind.

435
00:22:48,393 --> 00:22:51,161
Then where's he?

436
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:53,596
Excellent question.

437
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,338
<i>We had a deal!</i>

438
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,672
<i>Wait. Hold on, okay?</i>
<i>We're coming.</i>

439
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:03,807
<i>You can't escape me, Dean.</i>

440
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:05,308
<i>You're gonna die.</i>

441
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,011
<i>And</i> this -- <i>this is what</i>
<i>you're gonna become!</i>

442
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:10,113
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

443
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:13,483
<i>No!</i>
There's so much.

444
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:15,452
<i>Your own father didn't care</i>
<i>whether you lived or died.</i>

445
00:23:15,454 --> 00:23:17,020
<i>It's about</i>
<i>who's the bigger badass.</i>

446
00:23:18,757 --> 00:23:22,859
So much trauma
in Dean's mind.

447
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,461
So many scars.

448
00:23:24,463 --> 00:23:26,429
Well, yeah.

449
00:23:26,431 --> 00:23:28,898
Dean's been through a lot,
but he's strong.

450
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,134
Sam...

451
00:23:31,136 --> 00:23:32,635
you've both
been through a lot,

452
00:23:32,637 --> 00:23:35,905
and Dean
is more than strong.

453
00:23:35,907 --> 00:23:38,575
What I meant was,
if I knew...

454
00:23:38,577 --> 00:23:40,410
if I knew
what I was looking for,

455
00:23:40,412 --> 00:23:43,713
I could just --
I could simply go to it.

456
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:49,319
But because Michael has Dean
trapped away, drowning,

457
00:23:49,321 --> 00:23:50,620
I have to wade through

458
00:23:50,622 --> 00:23:54,758
all of Dean's
most terrible memories.

459
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,394
Cass, wait a second.

460
00:23:57,396 --> 00:24:01,131
Would Michael bury Dean
in trauma?

461
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:05,168
What do you mean?

462
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,170
I mean,
Michael said it himself.

463
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:08,671
The reason he left Dean
in the first place

464
00:24:08,673 --> 00:24:12,275
was because Dean was
fighting back so hard.

465
00:24:12,277 --> 00:24:15,645
So if Michael wanted
to keep Dean placated...

466
00:24:15,647 --> 00:24:18,214
Dean thrives on trauma.

467
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:19,649
I mean, he's had to
his whole life, right?

468
00:24:19,651 --> 00:24:21,384
It keeps him alert,
keeps him ready,

469
00:24:21,386 --> 00:24:24,687
but if I wanted to
distract Dean, I-I...

470
00:24:24,689 --> 00:24:27,857
I'd give him something
he's never had before.

471
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:30,026
- Contentment.
- Exactly.

472
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:31,961
So maybe, instead of looking
through his bad memories,

473
00:24:31,963 --> 00:24:33,696
maybe let's, uh...

474
00:24:33,698 --> 00:24:36,232
maybe let's look through
his good memories.

475
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:40,170
<i>I think I'm adorable.</i>

476
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:41,471
<i>You seem pretty cheery.</i>

477
00:24:41,473 --> 00:24:43,006
<i>Strippers, Sammy,</i>
<i>strippers.</i>

478
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,708
<i>We're on an actual case</i>
<i>involving strippers.</i>

479
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,311
<i>Finally. I'll stay here,</i>
<i>hook up with the posse.</i>

480
00:24:48,313 --> 00:24:50,346
<i>'Cause you know me --</i>
<i>I'm a posse magnet.</i>

481
00:24:50,348 --> 00:24:52,415
<i>Hey, see if they got</i>
<i>any pie.</i>

482
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:55,185
<i>This bar -- This bar --</i>
<i>This bar --</i>

483
00:24:55,187 --> 00:24:56,986
<i>I've never had anything</i>
<i>this nice.</i>

484
00:24:56,988 --> 00:24:58,388
<i>Rocky's</i>
<i>still isn't for sale.</i>

485
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,522
<i>Rocky's</i>
<i>still isn't for sale.</i>

486
00:24:59,524 --> 00:25:01,157
Wait a second.

487
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:03,460
<i>Still working that ghoul thing</i>
<i>in Wichita with Cass.</i>

488
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:04,861
<i>They should be back tonight.</i>

489
00:25:04,863 --> 00:25:06,663
<i>So that sale</i>
<i>that you want so bad,</i>

490
00:25:06,665 --> 00:25:08,498
<i>well, it's just not gonna happen.</i>
Yes. Definitely...

491
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,866
<i>You just gonna leave</i>
<i>the drunk guy out there</i>

492
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:10,934
<i>with all the booze?</i>
Cass.

493
00:25:10,936 --> 00:25:12,869
This has never happened.

494
00:25:12,871 --> 00:25:16,105
There.
Let's go there.

495
00:25:27,686 --> 00:25:29,118
Hey! There they are.

496
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,453
? I rode into town today ?

497
00:25:30,455 --> 00:25:33,423
Kill a ghoul, get a beer.

498
00:25:33,425 --> 00:25:35,959
? In my mind, I said -- ?
Dean?

499
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,548
Got this great IPA
from Austin -- Cosmic Cowboy.

500
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:44,951
You're gonna love it.

501
00:25:44,953 --> 00:25:47,687
Hey, Dean,
what's going on here?

502
00:25:47,689 --> 00:25:49,389
What are you
talking about?

503
00:25:49,391 --> 00:25:51,658
Cass? Sam?

504
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,593
I'm glad
you're back safe.

505
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,595
I was starting to worry.

506
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,497
Don't tell Dean.

507
00:25:57,499 --> 00:25:59,799
He'll use it against me.

508
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:01,634
? You'd be waiting at the end,
and I know ?

509
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:05,505
Uh, Pamela Barnes was blinded
when she saw my true form.

510
00:26:05,507 --> 00:26:07,974
Yeah. She was also
killed by a demon, so...

511
00:26:07,976 --> 00:26:10,043
Hey, what are you guys
waiting for?

512
00:26:10,045 --> 00:26:11,377
Drink up.

513
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:13,146
None of --
None of this is real, okay?

514
00:26:13,148 --> 00:26:15,615
T-This -- This bar,
uh, uh, Pamela...

515
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:16,916
Excuse me?

516
00:26:16,918 --> 00:26:18,851
You've never met anyone
more real than me,

517
00:26:18,853 --> 00:26:20,353
Sam Winchester.

518
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:24,257
You're just a complex
manifestation of Dean's memories

519
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:26,959
designed to distract him.

520
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:30,596
You really know how to
talk to a lady, don't ya?

521
00:26:30,598 --> 00:26:31,798
Okay, listen to me.

522
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,566
You have to remember
what's going on

523
00:26:33,568 --> 00:26:35,535
out -- out
in the real world.

524
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:37,370
I know it's raining.
What else do I need to know?

525
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,806
No, I'm not talking
about the rain --

526
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:41,140
I'm talking about
Michael!

527
00:26:42,577 --> 00:26:44,510
Where'd they go?

528
00:26:44,512 --> 00:26:46,345
Ohh!

529
00:26:48,783 --> 00:26:49,982
Is that...?

530
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:53,119
- Ohh.
- I think I can hear them.

531
00:26:59,027 --> 00:27:02,495
So, you guys gonna tell us
about the hunt or what?

532
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:05,098
Okay. W-What?
You were just...

533
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,834
What the hell
is going on here?

534
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,168
Okay. All right.

535
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,703
Now you're starting
to worry me.

536
00:27:10,705 --> 00:27:13,840
What is going on?

537
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:24,885
Ohhh.
? I rode into town today ?

538
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:28,688
You guys got real messy
on that ghoul hunt, huh?

539
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,723
No, we didn't get messy
on a hunt.

540
00:27:30,725 --> 00:27:33,659
We got messy just now,
in this bar,

541
00:27:33,661 --> 00:27:35,328
in a vampire fight.

542
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,063
? I rode into town today ?

543
00:27:37,065 --> 00:27:38,931
Maybe we should
rethink the beers.

544
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:39,866
Yeah.

545
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,734
Okay, Dean, listen to me.

546
00:27:41,736 --> 00:27:43,870
I think you're --
you're stuck in a loop

547
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,705
in -- in your mind.

548
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,106
Michael is possessing you.

549
00:27:47,108 --> 00:27:48,975
You -- You have to
remember that.

550
00:27:48,977 --> 00:27:50,376
Michael?
Yes.

551
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,478
Michael's in the Cage.

552
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,347
Come on, guys. What is this --
some kind of a joke?

553
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:56,015
No, Dean, it's not a joke.

554
00:27:56,017 --> 00:27:57,316
Okay. Okay.

555
00:27:57,318 --> 00:27:59,118
If we're
all in Dean's head,

556
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,954
then he should be able
to control things,

557
00:28:01,956 --> 00:28:03,422
like a lucid dream?

558
00:28:03,424 --> 00:28:05,358
? And if the wind
ever shows me where to go ?

559
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,360
Yeah. I-I don't know.
Maybe. I...

560
00:28:07,362 --> 00:28:08,795
? You'd be waiting at the end,
and I know ?

561
00:28:08,797 --> 00:28:11,097
Get me a shot.

562
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:13,599
With your brain.

563
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:18,337
Okay. Dean, listen to me.
This bar is not real.

564
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:19,972
Pamela isn't real.

565
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:22,375
Man, we were there together
when she was blinded.

566
00:28:22,377 --> 00:28:25,211
? This old mount I'm ridin',
she's gettin' kinda tired ?

567
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,621
? She's gonna take me to the end of our road ?
You're blind?

568
00:28:35,623 --> 00:28:37,857
Yeah, I've been blind
for a while.

569
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:39,725
Thank Feathers here
for that one.

570
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:41,861
That was --
Dean, that was an accident.

571
00:28:41,863 --> 00:28:43,563
? And I'm searchin'
for a rainbow ?

572
00:28:43,565 --> 00:28:45,364
Dean, she's not just blind.

573
00:28:45,366 --> 00:28:47,233
She's dead.

574
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:49,869
Pamela died helping us.

575
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:51,904
What happened?

576
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,479
Pamela?

577
00:29:07,355 --> 00:29:09,121
No. No, no, no, no.

578
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:10,957
Guys, this is --
this is my life.

579
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,226
This --
This is the dream.

580
00:29:13,228 --> 00:29:14,894
No, no, it's not.

581
00:29:14,896 --> 00:29:17,263
It's just <i>a</i> dream, Dean.

582
00:29:17,265 --> 00:29:18,865
That's all it is.

583
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:21,167
Please, you have to --

584
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:22,668
you have to
try to remember,

585
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,337
because the people
in your life --

586
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:26,672
in your real life,
out there --

587
00:29:26,674 --> 00:29:29,208
we need you to come back.

588
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,884
Poughkeepsie.

589
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:41,988
What'd you say?

590
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:45,291
Poughkeepsie.

591
00:30:13,454 --> 00:30:14,787
I remember.

592
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:19,926
I remember everything.

593
00:30:29,304 --> 00:30:30,903
Hey, fellas.

594
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:41,516
Well, this is fun.

595
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:44,420
Get out of my head.

596
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:48,190
You don't mean that, Dean,
not really.

597
00:30:48,192 --> 00:30:50,359
You may lie to them,

598
00:30:50,361 --> 00:30:55,397
but, deep down,
I know you.

599
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:57,933
I am you.

600
00:30:57,935 --> 00:31:01,670
You only tolerate the angel
because you think you owe him,

601
00:31:01,672 --> 00:31:06,375
because he "gripped you tight
and raised you from Perdition."

602
00:31:06,377 --> 00:31:08,844
Or whatever.

603
00:31:08,846 --> 00:31:12,815
But since then,
what has he done?

604
00:31:12,817 --> 00:31:14,516
Only made mistakes,

605
00:31:14,518 --> 00:31:17,086
one after the other.

606
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:19,521
And, Sam --
oh, Sam...

607
00:31:19,523 --> 00:31:23,158
You know, Dean was his happiest
when you quit hunting,

608
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,762
leaving him with your dad,
just the two of them.

609
00:31:26,764 --> 00:31:31,233
See, deep down, he knows that
you will always abandon him,

610
00:31:31,235 --> 00:31:33,569
again and again.

611
00:31:33,571 --> 00:31:35,971
Shut up!
You don't need them.

612
00:31:35,973 --> 00:31:37,706
You don't even like them.

613
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:41,643
They're not your family --
they're your responsibilities.

614
00:31:41,645 --> 00:31:44,847
They're a weight
around your neck.

615
00:31:44,849 --> 00:31:47,549
And deep down,
you wanted --

616
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:51,420
you were desperate
to get away from them.

617
00:31:51,422 --> 00:31:54,723
And that is why
you said yes.

618
00:31:54,725 --> 00:31:57,426
I said
shut your damn mouth!

619
00:31:57,428 --> 00:32:00,195
Wait.
Something's wrong.

620
00:32:00,197 --> 00:32:02,598
You're stalling.

621
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,700
Am I?

622
00:32:20,684 --> 00:32:22,785
Monsters! We're barely
ahead of them.

623
00:32:22,787 --> 00:32:24,286
Where's Sam?
We need --

624
00:32:25,556 --> 00:32:27,322
Never heard about them.

625
00:32:27,324 --> 00:32:28,423
What's going on?

626
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:29,892
They're trying to
help Dean.

627
00:32:29,894 --> 00:32:31,527
Tiger, lock down
the front door.

628
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:33,128
The rest of you guys,
get ready

629
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,763
if they make it through.
- Yes.

630
00:32:34,765 --> 00:32:36,165
You ready?

631
00:32:37,768 --> 00:32:39,668
Okay.

632
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,670
He's buying time

633
00:32:41,672 --> 00:32:45,374
so his monsters can get to us
and rescue him.

634
00:32:45,376 --> 00:32:48,844
You think I need them
to save me?

635
00:32:48,846 --> 00:32:49,812
Please.

636
00:32:49,814 --> 00:32:51,613
Fine. You're so tough,

637
00:32:51,615 --> 00:32:54,817
why don't you snap your fingers
and nuke us all?

638
00:32:56,086 --> 00:32:58,887
Is that what you want?

639
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:00,355
Yeah, I do.

640
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:04,059
He can't.

641
00:33:04,061 --> 00:33:07,396
Because, in here, we're all
just mental projections,

642
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:09,998
so in here,
we're all the same.

643
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,235
So, in here,
you're all talk.

644
00:33:20,444 --> 00:33:23,745
You think I need
my powers?

645
00:33:23,747 --> 00:33:26,381
I destroy worlds,

646
00:33:26,383 --> 00:33:30,452
and I'd crush you
with my bare hands.

647
00:33:30,454 --> 00:33:31,920
Prove it.

648
00:34:09,627 --> 00:34:11,860
- Is that...?
- It's them.

649
00:34:11,862 --> 00:34:13,295
Okay, they can't.

650
00:34:13,297 --> 00:34:15,998
They won't be able
to get through the door.

651
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,567
- They won't have to.
-Tiger?

652
00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:20,435
Tiger shouldn't have gone
in the woods alone.

653
00:34:23,107 --> 00:34:24,439
You should've locked the door.

654
00:35:01,178 --> 00:35:02,911
Whoa! Ow!

655
00:35:06,216 --> 00:35:07,749
No!

656
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:31,640
You fellas didn't think
this out, did you?

657
00:35:31,642 --> 00:35:33,976
Even if you could
force me out,

658
00:35:33,978 --> 00:35:38,046
what do you think
I'd leave behind, hm?

659
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:41,350
You'd be nothing
but blood and bone.

660
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,488
Then we don't
kick him out.

661
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,357
We keep him in.

662
00:36:04,341 --> 00:36:05,440
Aah!

663
00:36:07,177 --> 00:36:10,979
It'll hold.
My mind, my rules.

664
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:12,781
I got him.

665
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:16,952
I'm the Cage.

666
00:36:28,194 --> 00:36:32,096
We'll get the rest
of this cleaned up.

667
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:34,131
Yeah.

668
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:36,434
What about the rest
of Michael's monsters?

669
00:36:36,436 --> 00:36:38,035
We're getting in reports.

670
00:36:38,037 --> 00:36:39,237
After you guys woke up,

671
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:42,340
they all just went
their separate ways.

672
00:36:42,342 --> 00:36:45,176
I guess Michael
can't control them now.

673
00:36:46,846 --> 00:36:48,246
Huh.

674
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:52,116
Maggie...

675
00:36:52,118 --> 00:36:53,918
Thank you.

676
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,052
For everything.

677
00:36:55,054 --> 00:36:57,755
It wasn't me.

678
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,190
Jack, he...

679
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:04,228
I didn't know he could
still do that angel stuff.

680
00:37:06,866 --> 00:37:09,300
Yeah. Yeah.

681
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,870
I didn't, either.

682
00:37:12,872 --> 00:37:16,140
That magic
burns off your soul.

683
00:37:18,811 --> 00:37:21,679
It was an accident.
Yeah, but you can't afford

684
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:23,514
that kind of accident.

685
00:37:23,516 --> 00:37:26,317
You need your soul
to stay alive, to --

686
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:27,985
They would've killed you.

687
00:37:29,155 --> 00:37:30,721
I know.

688
00:37:32,558 --> 00:37:34,458
Look, I'm not mad at you.

689
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:37,561
I...

690
00:37:38,998 --> 00:37:42,199
I've just seen firsthand what
the absence of a soul does.

691
00:37:42,201 --> 00:37:44,568
And it's not just about
you staying alive, Jack.

692
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,104
It's about you staying you.

693
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,776
You understand?

694
00:37:56,749 --> 00:37:58,683
It won't happen again.

695
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,653
Okay.

696
00:38:18,705 --> 00:38:21,072
It's just you.

697
00:38:24,444 --> 00:38:28,179
It's just...you.

698
00:38:39,225 --> 00:38:41,125
Let me out! Come on!

699
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,970
It's all you.

700
00:39:15,128 --> 00:39:16,861
Dean.

701
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:21,031
So...not all good news.

702
00:39:23,169 --> 00:39:25,503
I did say
I'd see you again soon.

703
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:27,037
You could've knocked.

704
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:31,475
Figured all that banging on the
door in your head was enough.

705
00:39:31,477 --> 00:39:34,245
Michael's all locked up.

706
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,247
Seems that way.

707
00:39:38,151 --> 00:39:39,884
Sam said that
one of your reapers

708
00:39:39,886 --> 00:39:41,318
really came through
with the assist.

709
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,022
I'm thinking
that was probably you.

710
00:39:45,024 --> 00:39:47,625
Don't tell anyone.

711
00:39:47,627 --> 00:39:49,093
You broke the rules.

712
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:52,430
I took a calculated risk.

713
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,365
I warned you

714
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:58,903
about the dangers of jumping
from world to world.

715
00:39:58,905 --> 00:40:03,741
But you ignored me,
didn't you?

716
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:07,778
Rescuing Mom and Jack,

717
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,314
helping out
those other folks --

718
00:40:10,316 --> 00:40:12,216
I'd say it was worth it.

719
00:40:12,218 --> 00:40:14,318
And just look at you now.

720
00:40:17,657 --> 00:40:21,125
Do you remember visiting
my reading room?

721
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,461
The shelves and shelves
of notebooks

722
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:26,230
describing the ways
you might die?

723
00:40:26,232 --> 00:40:27,665
Yeah.

724
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:30,067
Upbeat classics.

725
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:33,204
Well, it's
the funniest thing,

726
00:40:33,206 --> 00:40:35,906
but they've all
been rewritten.

727
00:40:36,943 --> 00:40:40,344
They all end
the same way now --

728
00:40:40,346 --> 00:40:43,447
with the archangel Michael
escaping your mind

729
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:48,185
and using you as his vessel
to burn down this world.

730
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,189
All of them?

731
00:40:52,191 --> 00:40:53,924
All of them.

732
00:40:56,596 --> 00:40:58,562
Except one.

733
00:41:19,118 --> 00:41:22,186
What am I supposed to do
with this?

734
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,854
That's up to you.

735
