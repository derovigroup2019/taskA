1
00:00:01,165 --> 00:00:04,132
Sammy, it's me.

2
00:00:06,637 --> 00:00:08,670
I don't remember most
of what Michael did

3
00:00:08,672 --> 00:00:11,673
because I was underwater,
drowning...

4
00:00:11,675 --> 00:00:13,508
and that I remember.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,044
I felt every second
of it.

6
00:00:16,046 --> 00:00:18,580
Why would Michael
give up his vessel like that?

7
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:20,482
I don't know.

8
00:00:20,484 --> 00:00:23,318
- Ghosts 101.
- Ghost possession.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,920
Definitely a ghost.

10
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:26,154
Somebody's spirit
can attach itself

11
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:27,689
to an object
or a bunch of objects.

12
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:29,357
Everything has a weakness.

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,660
They hate
iron and salt.

14
00:00:31,662 --> 00:00:34,096
Whatever happens,
you stay inside this circle.

15
00:00:38,402 --> 00:00:40,569
- Where's the spear?!
- So Michael wants the spear

16
00:00:40,571 --> 00:00:42,504
because he knows
it can hurt him.

17
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:43,438
You're no different
than him.

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,006
I am nothing like him.

19
00:00:47,544 --> 00:00:49,111
<i>Do you</i>
<i>have unwanted gold</i>

20
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:51,246
<i>just lying around the house,</i>
<i>collecting dust?</i>

21
00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:53,582
<i>Why not turn that gold</i>
<i>into cash?</i>

22
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:55,117
<i>Here at Diamond Dave's,</i>

23
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,085
<i>you can have cash</i>
<i>in your hands today.</i>

24
00:00:57,087 --> 00:00:58,954
<i>We'll take anything</i>
<i>you want to sell us.</i>

25
00:00:58,956 --> 00:01:00,922
<i>When Aunt Gloria</i>
<i>passed away,</i>

26
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:03,291
<i>she left me so much jewelry,</i>
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

27
00:01:03,293 --> 00:01:05,127
<i>That's when I called</i>
<i>Diamond Dave.</i>

28
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,696
<i>If it's gold,</i>
<i>it's cash in your hands.</i>

29
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:10,932
<i>You're watching Shocker TV.</i>

30
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:16,238
<i>This week on Shocker,</i>
<i>it's gonna be a blood bath.</i>

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,573
<i>We've got slicing and dicing.</i>

32
00:01:18,575 --> 00:01:21,376
<i>We've got scream queens</i>
<i>and killing machines,</i>

33
00:01:21,378 --> 00:01:24,079
<i>24 hours a day, all week long.</i>

34
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:27,215
<i>Time to slice and dice.</i>

35
00:01:57,681 --> 00:01:59,815
Whoa.

36
00:01:59,817 --> 00:02:02,951
Mezco 15" Mega-Scale Panthro.

37
00:02:02,953 --> 00:02:04,486
So handsome.

38
00:02:04,488 --> 00:02:06,354
So angry.

39
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:32,480
Hey, Sam.

40
00:02:32,482 --> 00:02:34,382
<i>Stuart,</i>
<i>what did you do?</i>

41
00:02:34,384 --> 00:02:35,650
I...

42
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:36,952
Uh, nothing.

43
00:02:36,954 --> 00:02:38,520
<i>Really?</i>

44
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:40,222
<i>Because according to Yelp</i>

45
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:43,358
<i>and this awesome,</i>
<i>one-star review we just got,</i>

46
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,962
<i>you screamed at a customer</i>
<i>and called him a, quote,</i>

47
00:02:46,964 --> 00:02:50,565
<i>"mongoloid Tribble</i>
<i>in a robotic exoskeleton</i>

49
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:54,836
<i>Which is not cool,</i>

50
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:56,905
<i>and weirdly,</i>
<i>creepily specific.</i>

51
00:02:56,907 --> 00:02:59,574
That --

52
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:01,409
He said I couldn't
beat up Superman.

53
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:04,746
<i>Okay. Again,</i>
<i>Superman is not real.</i>

54
00:03:04,748 --> 00:03:06,381
Okay.
That's not the point.

55
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:08,149
<i>And I have seen you</i>
<i>get winded eating a taco.</i>

56
00:03:08,151 --> 00:03:09,684
Okay, that doesn't matter.

57
00:03:09,686 --> 00:03:11,920
If I had kryptonite gloves,
I could beat up Superman.

58
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:14,756
Anyone could.
That's science, Sam.

59
00:03:14,758 --> 00:03:18,426
<i>Look, I --</i>
<i>I like that you care --</i>

60
00:03:18,428 --> 00:03:20,328
<i>really, really care</i>
<i>about this stuff,</i>

61
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,531
<i>but we need every customer</i>
<i>we can get, okay?</i>

62
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:27,302
<i>So just chill</i>
<i>a little, please.</i>

63
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:31,840
Yeah, um...

64
00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:34,042
Okay.

65
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:37,779
I'm sorry, Sam. I just --
I just get spun out sometimes.

66
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:40,115
<i>I know.</i>

67
00:03:40,117 --> 00:03:41,383
Coming to game night?

68
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:43,351
<i>Of course.</i>

69
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:45,186
<i>I'll see you there.</i>

70
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:24,559
Yeah, well,
all I'm hearing is excuses.

71
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:28,797
Okay, look, I don't
care about traffic, okay?!

72
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,433
It has been
over 30 minutes, so --

73
00:04:31,435 --> 00:04:32,801
Hello?!

74
00:04:32,803 --> 00:04:35,270
Free pizza!

75
00:04:48,518 --> 00:04:49,851
The heck?

76
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:55,991

Yo.

00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:27,248
- Hey.
- What?

97
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,684
Uh, what you doing?

98
00:06:29,686 --> 00:06:31,719
Horror marathon
on Shocker.

99
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:33,121
Just made my way
through the "Halloweens"

100
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:35,590
and now I'm about to --

101
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,060
Oh, wow.

102
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:42,063
What?

103
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:44,966
Oh, yes, I shaved.

104
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:46,534
I mean, it's so smooth.

105
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:49,571
It's like a...
dolphin's belly.

106
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:51,106
Yeah, yeah.

107
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:54,109
Hey, um...

108
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:57,312
I wanted to check up on you.
You doing okay?

109
00:06:57,314 --> 00:06:58,646
I mean, y-you haven't really
come out of your room

110
00:06:58,648 --> 00:07:01,082
in almost a week.

111
00:07:01,084 --> 00:07:05,420
Well, since when is "okay"
a part of this job, huh?

112
00:07:05,422 --> 00:07:08,089
Yeah, Cass, is, you know,
showing Jack the ropes

113
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:10,091
and Dark Kaia and her spear
are in the wind

114
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:11,459
and we have no clue
where Michael is

115
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:13,928
or what he's up to.

116
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,630
And, not that
I'm complaining,

117
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:17,232
but...

118
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:22,904
the house is full
of strangers, so...

119
00:07:22,906 --> 00:07:25,673
So your plan is
to just lay in here,

120
00:07:25,675 --> 00:07:27,942
watching "Hatchet Man" movies,
seriously?

121
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:29,477
"All Saints' Day"
is a classic.

122
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:31,813
<i>Time to slice and dice.</i>

123
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:33,014
- Oh, is it?
- What do you care?

124
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:34,682
You don't even like
scary movies.

125
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:38,219
Well, yeah, Dean,
our <i>life</i> is a scary movie.

126
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:40,822
Exactly.

127
00:07:40,824 --> 00:07:43,424
<i>I like it when they run.</i>

128
00:07:43,426 --> 00:07:45,860
All right, well,
I hate to disturb your marathon,

129
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:47,795
but I think
I found us a case.

130
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:49,497
More Michael monsters?

131
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:52,033
No.

132
00:07:52,035 --> 00:07:53,234
Killer toy.

133
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,473
What kind of toy?

134
00:08:00,477 --> 00:08:02,544
<i>And then the thing</i>
<i>freakin' jumped me!</i>

135
00:08:02,546 --> 00:08:04,879
<i>I mean, It wouldn't stop!</i>
<i>It was just over and over.</i>

136
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:06,648
<i>Just...</i>

137
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:11,953
<i>Panthro kicked my ass.</i>

138
00:08:11,955 --> 00:08:13,454
ThunderCats?

139
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:14,589
Seriously?

140
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,224
Yeah.

141
00:08:16,226 --> 00:08:17,825
But, I mean,
you got your pizza,

142
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:19,527
at least eight more
of these movies,

143
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:20,962
so I'll just
leave you to it,

144
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:22,130
and I'll get one
of the other guys to --

145
00:08:22,132 --> 00:08:23,364
Oh, hell no.

146
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:24,966
Hell no.

147
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:26,568
No.

148
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,304
Panthro is mine.

149
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:40,848
I wonder if we're talking,
like, one toy gone bad

150
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,183
or if it's like
a whole crew,

151
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:43,818
you know,
like Puppet Master-style.

152
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,221
Do you actually want there
to be more than one?

153
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:48,723
I don't know,
just...

154
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:49,691
- Boo!
- Boo!

155
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:51,159
Aah.

156
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:52,360
Still not a fan
of Halloween, huh?

157
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:53,361
Nope.

158
00:08:53,363 --> 00:08:55,096
So lame.

159
00:08:55,098 --> 00:08:58,533
<i>Happy Halloween.</i>

160
00:08:58,535 --> 00:09:01,002
Hey, I can help you guys
in just a second.

161
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:08,042
Hm, she's like
your twin.

162
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:09,544
What? What are you
talking about?

163
00:09:09,546 --> 00:09:13,248
Her -- soft, delicate features,
luxurious hair.

164
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,216
She's like
your Wonder Twin.

165
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:17,485
Yeah.

166
00:09:20,423 --> 00:09:21,689
All right, okay.

167
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,958
Well, if that's me,
then, uh...

168
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,962
that's you over there.

169
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:29,430
- That guy?
- Yeah.

170
00:09:29,432 --> 00:09:34,035
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we have zero in common.

171
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:38,406
Hatchet Man.

172
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:39,707
No way. Sam.

173
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:41,409
Check it out.
It's David freakin' Yaeger.

174
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:42,277
Yeah.

175
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,379
Press the button.

176
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:45,313

00:09:50,086 --> 00:09:52,086
<i>Time to slice and dice.</i>

178
00:09:52,088 --> 00:09:54,322
Oh, dude.

179
00:09:54,324 --> 00:09:58,159
<i>We all do bad things sometimes.</i>

180
00:09:58,161 --> 00:09:59,927
<i>Trick or Treat!</i>

181
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:02,330
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Dude.

182
00:10:02,332 --> 00:10:04,565
- I need this.
- How much?

183
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:06,734
Not for sale.

184
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:07,869
Hatchet Man's a classic.

185
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,340
Yeah.
Nothing in common.

186
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:14,909
Okay, what can
I help you guys with?

187
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,944
Funko Pops,
Magic cards...?

188
00:10:16,946 --> 00:10:20,248
Uh, Stuart Blake --
Vintage Hot Wheels.

189
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,482
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:21,484 --> 00:10:23,818
Uh, were you getting
helped by Stuart

191
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,952
with vintage Hot Wheels,
or...

192
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:26,354
No, sorry.

193
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:28,690
Um, my name is Ian Gillan,
and this is...

194
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:30,358
I'm Ritchie Blackmore.

195
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,427
We're with Campbell & Sons
Insurance.

196
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:34,662
We heard about Stuart's
little incident with the toy,

197
00:10:34,664 --> 00:10:36,798
and, uh, we're hoping
to speak to him.

198
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,433
Well, he's at home
healing up.

199
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:39,834
Well, we went
to his place,

200
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:41,336
and his roommate said
he had moved out.

201
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:42,837
Kicked out, actually.

202
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,673
Right.
They had a fight.

203
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:47,675
Over...?

204
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:49,844
"Fist of
the North Star."

205
00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:52,046
Stuart said that
the dubbed version was better,

206
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:54,048
but --
You know what, forget it.

207
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,486
Um, I like Stuart,
but he's an acquired taste.

208
00:10:58,488 --> 00:11:00,855
Sounds like a guy
who could make a lot of enemies.

209
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:03,191
I mean, not real ones.

210
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:07,061
Maybe online --
He trolls everything.

211
00:11:07,063 --> 00:11:09,797
Okay, uh...
where can we find Stuart now?

212
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,532
He's at his mom's house.

213
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:14,001
Of course he is.

214
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:16,471
Thanks.

215
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:21,676
Stewie will be up
in just a minute.

216
00:11:21,678 --> 00:11:23,111
Thanks.

217
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:28,716
I can't believe you had her
make us apple cider.

218
00:11:28,718 --> 00:11:30,084
She offered.

219
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:33,020
No! No!
You stupid, dumb --

220
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:35,556
That's not how you play
the...

221
00:11:35,558 --> 00:11:39,060
Game over!
I'm done! Done!

222
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:44,031
Who are you?

223
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:46,067
Uh, we're from
Campbell & Sons Insurance,

224
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:48,436
and --
- What are you doing down there?

225
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:50,738
Fortnite.

226
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,340
Hm.

227
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:54,175
It's a video game.

228
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:57,578
It's <i>the</i> video game.

229
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,547
Yeah, well,
I'm a Zelda for life, so...

230
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:05,420
What, are you burning sage
down there?

231
00:12:05,422 --> 00:12:07,121
So...?

232
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:10,892
I-I dated this goth chick.
Like, super hot.

233
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:13,561
Met online, and --
and she was into Wicca.

234
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:16,197
Said that burning sage
was, like, good luck

235
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:17,732
or some crap like that.

236
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:19,100
Hmm.

237
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:21,068
So, you're not together
anymore?

238
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,403
No.

239
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,238
I broke it off
before we could MIRL.

240
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,375
You know, I mean, who needs
goth-girl drama, am I right?

241
00:12:27,377 --> 00:12:29,644
- Merle?
- Uh, M-I-R-L.

242
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:31,112
"Meet in real life."

243
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:32,447
Why do you know
what that means?

244
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,483
Stuart, we're here
to ask about the attack

245
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:36,751
you reported
with the toy --

246
00:12:36,753 --> 00:12:38,252
I made it up.

247
00:12:38,254 --> 00:12:39,921
You what?

248
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:42,623
The whole thing.
I lied.

249
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,125
But the video...

250
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:46,794
That was fake.

251
00:12:46,796 --> 00:12:50,331
I didn't expect it to go viral,
but it did,

252
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,134
and, uh...I just...

253
00:12:53,136 --> 00:12:55,136
I fell.

254
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:56,671
Hm.

255
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:58,639
'Cause the hospital report said
that you had marks

256
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:00,975
on your face, your legs,
your back,

257
00:13:00,977 --> 00:13:02,443
and your...
genitals.

258
00:13:02,445 --> 00:13:03,911
That's not a slip
and fall.

259
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:05,179
Well, I don't see why
an insurance company

260
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:06,681
would care, you know?

261
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:08,616
And I-I think it's time
for you to leave.

262
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:10,017
- Okay, but --
- Now.

263
00:13:12,121 --> 00:13:13,754
Wow.

264
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:16,290
Lady-you wasn't kidding.
That guy's a piece of work.

265
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:18,693
Well, whatever happened
was not an accident.

266
00:13:18,695 --> 00:13:20,328
Okay, but, uh...
Big Bang in there,

267
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,529
not a great liar.

268
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:22,830
No.

269
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:24,632
So, what are we thinking?
Spell?

270
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:26,300
Well, his girlfriend
was into Wicca.

271
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:27,635
Wicca doesn't always
mean witch.

272
00:13:27,637 --> 00:13:29,437
Except when it does.

273
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:31,472
All right, let's wait
till they leave,

274
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:33,274
check out the house
for hex bags.

275
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:35,042
Deal.

276
00:13:35,044 --> 00:13:38,946
Yeah, find some
lamb's blood.

277
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,982
Right, exactly.

278
00:13:40,984 --> 00:13:42,049
All right, good.

279
00:13:42,051 --> 00:13:43,951
Stay safe.

280
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:45,820
All good?

281
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:48,723
Yeah, it was Riley.
He'll be fine.

282
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:50,625
I don't know who Riley is,
but cool.

283
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:54,562
Happy Halloween!

284
00:13:54,564 --> 00:13:56,564
So, seriously, what is your deal
with Halloween?

285
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:59,300
I don't like it.

286
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:01,402
Yeah, but why don't
you like it? Hmm?

287
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:03,004
And don't give me
that, like,

288
00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:06,040
"Oh, every day is Halloween
for us" crap, okay?

289
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:08,175
Because, one,
it ain't.

290
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:09,477
We don't eat
that much candy.

291
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:12,179
Two, you've had this hate on
for years.

292
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:15,049
So...?

293
00:14:15,051 --> 00:14:16,417
Mom's on the move.

294
00:14:40,243 --> 00:14:43,344
All right,
what about our guy?

295
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:47,882
You know, I think I know
why Stuart changed his story.

296
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:50,284
Uh, the comments on his video
are all pretty brutal.

297
00:14:50,286 --> 00:14:55,356
People are calling him a liar,
a loser, "ThunderSpaz,"

298
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:59,193
Snarf's love child,
Panthro's bi...

299
00:14:59,195 --> 00:15:01,562
- Rhymes with "itch"?
- Yep.

300
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:04,632
Got to love the Internet,
where everyone can be a dick.

301
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:08,102
Help me!

302
00:15:08,104 --> 00:15:10,638
Help me! Help!

303
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:19,313
Stay with him.

304
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:21,248
Okay, uh...

305
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,118
Hang in there. Hey, wait.
We'll get you help.

306
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:30,471
My poor baby.

307
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:32,139
Yeah, it was touch and go
there for a while,

308
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:34,542
but, uh, doctors say
he's gonna be all right.

309
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:37,778
I'm just grateful
you showed up.

310
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,180
I...

311
00:16:40,984 --> 00:16:42,516
Thank you.

312
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:45,353
You saved his life.

313
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:47,622
Oh, I-I should
run back home,

314
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:49,991
get -- get Stewie
his favorite pillow.

315
00:16:49,993 --> 00:16:51,692
Actually,
you know what? Um...

316
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:53,828
It's probably better
if you just stay here.

317
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,897
Yeah, just until he wakes up,
you know?

318
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:00,067
Yeah, of course.
You're -- You're right.

319
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:02,036
I'm just all flustered.

320
00:17:02,038 --> 00:17:04,405
It's okay.
Everything's fine.

321
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:07,341
Everything is <i>not</i> fine.

322
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:09,010
Yeah. My first clue was
the flying chainsaw.

323
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:10,511
While you were waiting
for the ambulance,

324
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:12,013
I did a quick sweep
for hex bags, nothing,

325
00:17:12,015 --> 00:17:14,582
but then I pulled out EMF,
went freakin' crazy.

326
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:16,651
- So it's a ghost.
- Yeah.

327
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:18,085
Hey, we got to
figure out a way

328
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:19,420
to keep mom here
while we clear the house.

329
00:17:19,422 --> 00:17:21,022
You know, I don't get
why a ghost would be

330
00:17:21,024 --> 00:17:22,256
gunning for Stuart.

331
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:24,058
Murder,
grave robbery,

332
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,493
stole his favorite
Pok?mon --

333
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:26,594
I mean, take your pick.

334
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:27,828
Yeah.

335
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,063
All right,
you stay here with them.

336
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:30,598
I'll go check the house,
ask around,

337
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,166
see if anybody --
- Got dead lately?

338
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:34,702
- Yeah.
- All right.

339
00:17:34,704 --> 00:17:37,405
<i>GI Lab, 6-2-6-7.</i>

340
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:22,149

341

Smooth.

342
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:34,628

Just keeping an eye

350
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:08,295
He must have
awesome insurance.

351
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:09,964
Super-awesome.

00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:11,198

355
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:21,709
Yeah, the nurse told me.

356
00:19:21,711 --> 00:19:23,377
Babs went out for
a quick bite.

357
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:25,546
Figured
I'd stick around.

358
00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:27,815
I want to be here
when he wakes up.

359
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:30,050
He's kind of
my best friend.

360
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:32,953
Is that right?

361
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:35,723
Look, I...

362
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:40,361
I know Stuart has his stuff,
but we all do.

363
00:19:40,363 --> 00:19:42,963
And me and my dad don't
get along so great,

364
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:46,333
and whenever we --
we really have it out,

365
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:49,203
Stuart lets me
crash at his place.

366
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:50,838
No questions asked.

367
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,875
We just eat pizza
and watch movies.

368
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:56,510
It's...

369
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:59,647
Zen.

370
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:01,515
Sounds like
a good friend.

371
00:20:01,517 --> 00:20:04,185
Yeah, but now,
when his mom called,

372
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:07,588
said someone a-attacked him
with a chainsaw?

373
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,590
Looks like.

374
00:20:09,592 --> 00:20:11,892
Happy Halloween, huh?

375
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:22,703
<i>Oh, I got to get</i>
<i>out of here.</i>

376
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:25,239
Cool.
"All Saints' Day Three."

377
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:27,041
<i>Totally...</i>

378
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:29,910
Time to
slice and dice!

379
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:35,115
<i>Like,</i>
<i>creeping me out to the max.</i>

380
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:38,285
<i>Trick or treat.</i>

381
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:41,956
<i>Time to slice and dice.</i>

382
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,024
Never gets old.

383
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:45,259
You know, a lot of people
don't like this one,

384
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:47,027
but it's actually
my favorite.

385
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:48,796
I mean, sure.

386
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:50,631
There's no way a hospital would
ever be <i>that</i> empty.

387
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:52,800
but that's over-thinking it.
- I don't know.

388
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:54,268
I've been to a lot of hospitals
at night.

389
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,936
Trust me,
they get pretty empty.

390
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:57,738
Okay, so,
"All Saints' Day Three" --

391
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,406
That's my top pick.
What about you?

392
00:20:59,408 --> 00:21:03,143
I mean, I like Five,
right --

393
00:21:03,145 --> 00:21:04,712
"Search for
David Yaeger"?

394
00:21:04,714 --> 00:21:06,080
'Cause it's weird,
but it's bloody.

395
00:21:06,082 --> 00:21:06,981
- So bloody.
- Yeah.

396
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:08,115
In the best way.

397
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:10,384
But, uh...

398
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:11,986
I got to go
with number four.

399
00:21:11,988 --> 00:21:13,220
- "Hatchet Man Lives"?
- Yeah.

400
00:21:13,222 --> 00:21:15,756
Nice choice.

401
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:18,792
"Killed in a prank
gone wrong..."

402
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:22,663
"Mechanic David Yaeger
comes back every year

403
00:21:22,665 --> 00:21:25,165
on the day after Halloween.

404
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:29,003
On All Saints' Day,
Hatchet Man takes his revenge!"

405
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:32,172
You really know
your A.S.D.

406
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:33,674
Yeah, well...

407
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:35,976
growing up,
it was, uh...

408
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:38,746
It was always nice to check out
once in a while.

409
00:21:38,748 --> 00:21:41,115
I like to watch movies

410
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:43,250
where I know
the bad guy's gonna lose.

411
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:46,420
<i>Knock knock.</i>

412
00:21:46,422 --> 00:21:48,722
<i>Time to die.</i>

413
00:21:54,263 --> 00:21:56,196
Oh, um, we're, um --
we're closing.

414
00:21:56,198 --> 00:21:57,831
Yeah, right. I-I just, uh...

415
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,667
Sorry.
I'm just here to, um...

416
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:02,336
Did you hear
about Stuart?

417
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:04,271
Yeah, his mom
told us what happened

418
00:22:04,273 --> 00:22:05,773
when she dropped off his keys.
- Yeah.

419
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:07,641
I mean, what happened to him,
that's insane.

420
00:22:07,643 --> 00:22:10,644
Yeah, yeah, so -- so I actually
have a few questions, um...

421
00:22:10,646 --> 00:22:12,813
and they might be
a little different.

422
00:22:12,815 --> 00:22:16,016
- Different like...
- Different like, uh...

423
00:22:16,018 --> 00:22:20,187
Has anyone close to Stuart
died recently?

424
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:22,056
You're an insurance dude,
right?

425
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:24,224
Yeah, yeah, and --
and we wouldn't normally

426
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:25,559
ask these kinds of questions,

427
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:27,494
but it's a special
circumstance, and...

428
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:29,830
Well, I mean...

429
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:31,632
Jordan.

430
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:32,833
Jordan?

431
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:34,969
Yeah, he owned the store.

432
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:36,904
He taught Stuart,
Dirk, and I

433
00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:39,373
everything we know
about comics and games.

434
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,076
He was like our own personal
Willy Wonka.

435
00:22:42,078 --> 00:22:43,410
Huh.

436
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:45,846
Sounds like a great guy.

437
00:22:45,848 --> 00:22:48,549
He was.

438
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:50,150
Cancer sucks, you know?

439
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:52,186
Yeah.

440
00:22:52,188 --> 00:22:55,489
So, who owns
the place now?

441
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:57,424
Me and Dirk.

442
00:22:57,426 --> 00:22:58,692
Jordan left it to us.

443
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:01,095
But not Stuart?

444
00:23:01,097 --> 00:23:04,565
Stuart worked here,
but Jordan fired him twice.

445
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:06,100
He kept catching
Stuart stealing,

446
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:07,334
and to Jordan,

447
00:23:07,336 --> 00:23:09,370
this place was his life,
you know?

448
00:23:09,372 --> 00:23:11,905
And you hired
Stuart back?

449
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:14,108
He's my friend.

450
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:18,012
Right.

451
00:23:18,014 --> 00:23:20,381
Okay, uh...
Where is Jordan buried?

452
00:23:20,383 --> 00:23:22,916
Nowhere.
He was cremated.

453
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:27,888
Oh, um, right.

454
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,091
Sure, uh, excuse me.
I just have to, uh...

455
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:32,726
What's that?

456
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:36,563
Nothing.

457
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:40,567
It's a, um...
carbon monoxide detector.

458
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:42,870
Wh-- Is that --
Is that bad?

459
00:23:42,872 --> 00:23:45,072
Yeah, yep.

460
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:47,241
Pretty bad.
Um...

461
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:49,610
You know what?
Uh, you should leave now.

462
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,168
- What? No.
- Okay, listen to me.

463
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:53,144
This is weird,
but I think you're in danger --

464
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,517
Samantha?

465
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,722
Samantha!

466
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:23,827
Hey!

467
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,396
Hey, are you okay?

468
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,531
No?

469
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,232
What just happened?

470
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,534
I think, uh...

471
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,102
I think a ghost --

472
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:33,370
A ghost?

473
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,505
Yes, um... All right.
Listen to me.

474
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,508
Ghosts are real,
and they can possess things --

475
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,677
uh, people,
toys, chainsaws,

476
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,179
and, apparently,
life-size figurines.

477
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,881
You are not from
an insurance company, are you?

478
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,083
N-Not exactly.

479
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,186
Listen,
I-I-I'm not sure,

480
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:52,122
but I think the ghost of Jordan
is trying to kill Stuart.

481
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:53,423
Wait, what?

482
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,891
Did he hurt you?

483
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,393
No, he just --

484
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:59,296
He shoved me out of the way,
and then he bolted.

485
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,931
It's locked.

486
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:03,266
Where are the keys?

487
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:04,968
Hatchet Man or whatever
took them.

488
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,303
- You sure?
-I --

489
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,138
I was pretty busy
screaming,

490
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,073
but, yeah, I'm sure.

491
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,441
Is this expensive?

492
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,642
What?

493
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,211
- No, don't!
- Eugh!

494
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,948
Yeah,
it's shatter-proof glass.

495
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,985
Jordan's pretty serious
about thieves.

496
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,991
The aerobics instructor
in the giant mixer.

497
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,493
Right, and then the kids
the next morning are

498
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:30,994
at the rec center,
they're all eating breakfast,

499
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,829
and the one finds a tooth
with all the stringy bits

500
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:33,730
still hooked onto it.

501
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:34,898
Oh, come on.

502
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,233
I mean,
forget Freddy and Jason.

503
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:38,068
That's top-10 horror-movie kill
right there.

504
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,469
Top-five, even.

505
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,438
Oh, and then,
the jock guy's face

506
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,507
when Hatchet Man shoves it into
the engine fan of that truck

507
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,775
and it just, like...
bbl-bbl-bbl-bbl-bbl-bbl...

508
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,614
Did you know that
they made the brain splatter

509
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,315
with saltwater taffy?

510
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,783
I did not know that.
Yeah.

511
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:56,820
That's pretty cool.

512
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:58,989
Excuse me.

513
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:02,826
Yeah, what's up, Sam?

514
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,361
We were right.
It's a ghost.

515
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:05,962
Guy's name was
Jordan MacNeel.

516
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,330
He used to own
the comic shop.

517
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,165
All right, so we going
to a graveyard or what?

518
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,967
No, no, no.
He was cremated.

519
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,636
And, um...

520
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:14,371
And what?

521
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:16,940
So, he possessed the
David Yaeger figure at the shop,

522
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,441
<i>and I think he's coming</i>
<i>for Stuart.</i>

523
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,010
Wait, wait, wait --
Are you telling me that --

524
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:23,146
that Hatchet Man David Yaeger
is coming here?

525
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,215
<i>Uh, I mean, not --</i>
<i>not literally, but...</i>

526
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:29,653
Hatchet Man is
coming here?

527
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,658
<i>Trick or treat.</i>

528
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,972
Hey, hey.
Look at that.

529
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,408
Hey, man!

530
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,043
Whoo!

531
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:55,745
David Yaeger!

532
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,747
Killer costume!

533
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:02,752
Come on, let's go.
Hey, trick or treat!

534
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,323
If ghosts are real,
does that mean vampires?

535
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:07,190
Yep.

536
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,592
- Witches?
- Uh-huh.

537
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:09,926
Werewolves?

538
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,729
Unless it's Godzilla,
it's real.

539
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,097
All right.
Get in.

540
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,699
But --
Now!

541
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,000
Now, listen to me.

542
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,435
Ghosts can't cross
the salt line, okay?

543
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:19,769
So whatever you hear,
whatever you see,

544
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:22,372
whatever happens,
stay inside.

545
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,441
Capiche?

546
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,680
What I don't get is,

547
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:33,516
why is Jordan going
after Stuart now?

548
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,452
It doesn't make
any sense.

549
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,621
Stuart's been
stealing.

550
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,623
- What?
- I mean, not cash,

551
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,458
just stuff that
he thought was cool.

552
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,393
And Stuart doesn't have
good impulse control.

553
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,894
I've been taking money
out of his checks

554
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,429
to make up for it,
but I guess...

555
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,365
a ghost wouldn't
know that.

556
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:49,599
Yeah, guess not.

557
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:52,135
Oh, come on.

558
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,536
Damn it.

559
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,071
Yeah.
It's a hardcore lock.

560
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,406
All right.
We got to get out of here.

561
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:59,242
Okay, how?

562
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,710
Do you have
cleaning supplies?

563
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,958
What the...

564
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,995
Aaah!

565
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:28,104
Help!

566
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,106
What's happening?

567
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,175
I got to get
out of here!

568
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,935
Hey!

569
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,171
Jordan, I --

570
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,339
I know you're trying
to kill Stuart,

571
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,175
but he's <i>my</i> friend.

572
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,677
He's <i>our</i> friend.

573
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,846
So if you want
to do this,

574
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,314
you're gonna have
to go through me!

575
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,725
Oh, crap.

576
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:25,695
<i>Hey, Phil.</i>
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

577
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,231
<i>Come on.</i>

578
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,005
Oh, no.

579
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,340
Run. Run, girl.

580
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,811
<i>I like it when they run.</i>

581
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,179
Now, you see that?
You see that?

582
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,048
That's...
my favorite part.

583
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:53,089
<i>Stop!</i>
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

584
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,927
<i>Enough talking.</i>
<i>More killing.</i>

585
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,662
You kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

586
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:00,830
Ooh.
Right?

587
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:03,233
- She is so slow.
- Come on, man.

588
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:05,235
<i>Somebody come</i>
<i>and help me please!</i>

589
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:10,173
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

590
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,008
Ooh!
Run, girl! Run!

591
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,210
Mm!

592
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,212
You got to run, girl.
Come on, man.

593
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,714
My grandmother runs
faster than you.

594
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:19,549
Help! Somebody!

595
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,751
Anybody help me!

596
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,457
Where is everybody?!

597
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:33,963
Oh, God.

598
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:37,567
Oh, God.
Jordan, please!

599
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:41,204
You're dead!

600
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,872
<i>Get away from me!</i>

601
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,440
<i>We killed you.</i>
<i>You're dead!</i>

602
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:48,444
<i>We all do bad things</i>
<i>sometimes.</i>

603
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:49,946
Press that button.
Press that button.

604
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,115
He would never catch me,
tell you that much.

605
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:56,986
<i>No, this can't</i>
<i>be happening.</i>

606
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:00,723
No. No!

607
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:04,327
<i>You can't run</i>
<i>from Hatchet Man.</i>

608
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,930
<i>This isn't...</i>
...real!

609
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,437
All right.

610
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,406
Pretty sure
this will work.

611
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:18,408
Where did you learn
how to do this?

612
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,344
I had a messed-up
childhood.

613
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,012
Okay.

614
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,782
Here goes.

615
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:28,651
Yep, all right.
Uh, get back.

616
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,528
Get down.

617
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:48,872
- Cool.           - Cool.

618
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,954
Told you to stay put.

619
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,523
You don't --
He's here.

620
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:08,858
Where?

621
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,197

622
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:17,100

625
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:35,852
<i>turned deadly.</i>

626
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:38,187
One day,
we're gonna have to answer

627
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,256
for the things
we did that night.

628
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,259
It was just a prank.

629
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:49,832
<i>Now, David Yaeger is back</i>
<i>with his faithful hatchet</i>

630

631

00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:18,761
No, this can't

All right, look, man.

646
00:33:34,177 --> 00:33:36,678
I know once you go Casper,
things can be a little --

647
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,446
well, a lot crazy.

648
00:33:38,448 --> 00:33:40,982
The way I see it,
you got two options.

649
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:44,285
One, you let this go,
and you walk into the light.

650
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:46,254
Or, two...

651
00:33:46,256 --> 00:33:47,588

I was kind of hoping
you'd say that.

654
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:08,509
Stay back!
I got this.

655
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,023
Problem is, the ghost is always
tied to an object.

656
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:24,058
Right? Its bones, something
that meant a lot to it in life.

657
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,793
Whatever that thing is,
the ghost is usually

658
00:34:25,795 --> 00:34:27,328
stuck there, but Jordan,
he's been all over --

659
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,796
the shop, Stuart's house,

660
00:34:28,798 --> 00:34:30,631
so how's he moving around?
- The key chain.

661
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:32,300
- What?
- It was Jordan's

662
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:34,035
and then Stuart closed up
the night he got attacked

663
00:34:34,037 --> 00:34:35,570
and he brought
the shop keys home

664
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:37,071
and then his mom
brought them back after.

665
00:34:37,073 --> 00:34:39,707
I mean, could that --
Does that make sense?

666
00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:42,977
Yeah.

00:36:52,327 --> 00:36:55,495
Hmm?

685
00:36:55,497 --> 00:36:56,863
You, uh...
You got me out here

686
00:36:56,865 --> 00:36:58,832
'cause you needed
to get me out of my funk

687
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:01,634
and get me a win,
and you did.

688
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,570
So...

689
00:37:03,572 --> 00:37:05,038
thanks.

690
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,906
I got to admit,

691
00:37:06,908 --> 00:37:08,559
it didn't go exactly like
I thought it would.

692
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,710
Hey, man. I just went toe-to-toe
with David freakin' Yaeger.

693
00:37:10,712 --> 00:37:12,245
That was awesome.

694
00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:14,480
Yeah, it wasn't really --
Don't ruin this for me.

695
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:21,888
Hey, Dean...

696
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,224
when we get back
to the bunker, man,

697
00:37:24,226 --> 00:37:26,159
you got to stop hiding out
in your room.

698
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,327
I'm not hiding out.

699
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:28,394
And I get why
you're doing it.

700
00:37:28,396 --> 00:37:30,597
I-I do.

701
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,765
But...

702
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:36,102
what happened
with Michael...

703
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:39,873
You said yes for me, for Jack,
for your family.

704
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:41,074
You did the right thing.

705
00:37:41,076 --> 00:37:42,375
What happened after,

706
00:37:42,377 --> 00:37:44,010
just because Michael
was wearing your face,

707
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,279
doesn't mean
any of this is on you.

708
00:37:46,281 --> 00:37:48,748
I don't blame you.
No one blames you.

709
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,184
You got to try and stop
blaming yourself,

710
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,919
please.

711
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:55,054
I'm never gonna get
over it, okay?

712
00:37:55,056 --> 00:37:57,223
I'm just not.

713
00:37:57,225 --> 00:38:00,059
But you're right --

714
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:01,427
I'm not doing
anybody any good

715
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:02,762
by just staying couped up
in my room,

716
00:38:02,764 --> 00:38:09,235
so...whatever you need,
I'm there.

717
00:38:09,237 --> 00:38:11,938
All right, <i>chief?</i>

718
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,809
All right.
Well, that is it.

719
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:18,611
Halloween is
officially over.

720
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:20,046
Good.

721
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,648
Okay, seriously, why?

722
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,950
Why do you hate Halloween?
What is it?

723
00:38:23,952 --> 00:38:26,085
Was it the time that I --
I ate all your Halloween candy?

724
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:27,553
- No.
- Was it something Dad did?

725
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,455
No, dude, you don't
want to know.

726
00:38:29,457 --> 00:38:32,525
No, I really do.
Really.

727
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,562
What?

728
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,899
All right.

729
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,501
Remember Andrea Howell?

730
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:45,905
No.

731
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,474
When I was in sixth grade,
we were living in Bismark.

732
00:38:48,476 --> 00:38:49,909
I had a huge crush on her.

733
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,577
Aww, that's adorable.

734
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,946
Continue.

735
00:38:52,948 --> 00:38:55,982
So, she invited me
to her Halloween party.

736
00:38:55,984 --> 00:38:57,350
I said yes,
and I-I went over,

737
00:38:57,352 --> 00:39:03,156
and at first, everything
was great, um...

738
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:05,291
And then we started
to play games.

739
00:39:05,293 --> 00:39:06,859
Spin the bottle?

740
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:09,295
B-Bobbing for apples.

741
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:15,201
Like I said,
I had a crush,

742
00:39:15,203 --> 00:39:19,172
so the entire night,
my stomach was in knots,

743
00:39:19,174 --> 00:39:23,176
and when it was my turn,
I-I bent down, and...

744
00:39:23,178 --> 00:39:24,510
No.

745
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:26,612
...hurled.

746
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,214
Everywhere.

747
00:39:28,216 --> 00:39:30,950
Lunch, dinner,
it all came up --

748
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,986
on Andrea, mostly.

749
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:35,655
Uh, people
ran and screamed,

750
00:39:35,657 --> 00:39:39,459
and it was <i>so</i> bad.

751
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:41,160
That's great.

752
00:39:41,162 --> 00:39:43,730
I ended up hiding out
in the woods

753
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:45,565
until you finally
came and got me.

754
00:39:45,567 --> 00:39:48,134
So that's why
you hate Halloween.

755
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,836
- Yeah.
- Oh, come on, man.

756
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:51,504
You got to get over that.
That's -- I mean...

757
00:39:51,506 --> 00:39:52,972
All right.
This is what we're gonna do.

758
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:56,242
Next year, we're doing Halloween
right, okay?

759
00:39:56,244 --> 00:39:59,579
I'm thinking matching outfits
like, uh...

760
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:01,080
Batman and Robin.

761
00:40:01,082 --> 00:40:02,882
No.

762
00:40:02,884 --> 00:40:04,317
- Bert and Ernie.
- No.

763
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,685
- That's weird.
- Yes.

764
00:40:05,687 --> 00:40:06,753
Uh...

765
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:07,754
Rocky and Bullwinkle.

766
00:40:07,756 --> 00:40:08,688
Dean...

767
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:09,856
Shaggy and Scooby.

768
00:40:09,858 --> 00:40:11,024
Why would we...

769
00:40:11,026 --> 00:40:12,392
Turner and Hooch.

770
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:14,027
Ren and Stimpy.

771
00:40:14,029 --> 00:40:16,496
Come on, now.

772
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,097
- Thelma and Louise.
- Thelma and --

773
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:22,668
We just put it in drive
and go.

774
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,702
What the...

775
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,572
<i>Trick or treat.</i>
