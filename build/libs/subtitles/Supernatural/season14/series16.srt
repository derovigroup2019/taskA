1
00:00:00,139 --> 00:00:01,472
Monsters!

2
00:00:05,935 --> 00:00:08,464
Those guys
hunt monsters.

3
00:00:08,465 --> 00:00:10,332
That is so cool.

4
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:12,319
Come on!

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,718
Mom doesn't want
to leave these people,

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,953
so let's take them
with us.

7
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:17,222
I hate this place
right now.

8
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:19,958
Those Hunters, t-that's on me.
I brought them here.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,127
Everywhere I look,
I see them.

10
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:23,128
I see Maggie.

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,398
Sam!

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,067
You know, I think
I just need some time.

13
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:30,869
And what about that kid
with the dumb

14
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:32,303
Bambi-look on his face
all the time?

15
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:33,138
Hello.

16
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,973
I am a Winchester!

17
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:40,044
You killed Michael.
You consumed his grace.

18
00:00:40,046 --> 00:00:41,413
Do you have
your powers back?

19
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:44,082
I'm me again.

20
00:00:44,084 --> 00:00:45,850
And your soul?

21
00:00:45,852 --> 00:00:47,886
You want to know how much
of my soul I had to burn off

22
00:00:47,888 --> 00:00:49,187
to kill Michael.

23
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:50,655
Yes.

24
00:00:50,657 --> 00:00:52,524
I don't know.

25
00:00:52,526 --> 00:00:53,658
So, what's the verdict?

26
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,993
I'd keep an eye on him,

27
00:00:54,995 --> 00:00:57,495
but I think...
if he seems okay,

28
00:00:57,497 --> 00:00:59,564
he probably is.

29
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:02,167
I feel...
different now.

30
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:30,895
What was that?

31
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:34,365
It was nothing.
Just the wind.

32
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,903
Okay, that --
that wasn't the wind.

33
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:50,081
I'll check it out.

34
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,951
- What are you guys doing?
- Dad?

35
00:01:55,589 --> 00:01:56,888
Barbara.

36
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,223
Hi, Sheriff.

37
00:01:58,225 --> 00:02:00,492
Do your parents know
where you are right now?

38
00:02:00,494 --> 00:02:02,727
Why do <i>you</i> care?

39
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:03,995
You're supposed
to be studying.

40
00:02:03,997 --> 00:02:05,997
At Mom's.
This is not your weekend.

41
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,499
Besides, she's --

42
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:10,268
Out of town. With Todd.
I know.

43
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,003
She called you.
You weren't home.

44
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:13,404
She called me.

45
00:02:13,406 --> 00:02:15,607
She's worried.

46
00:02:15,609 --> 00:02:18,743
Well, you found me.
Good for you.

47
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:20,545
- Hey. Watch it.
- Or what?

48
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:24,282
Hey, where you going?

49
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:26,784
Um...bathroom.

50
00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:28,453
You guys need some space.

51
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,997
Ugh.

52
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:57,982
Oh, God.

53
00:02:57,984 --> 00:03:00,785
Tom, you shouldn't
be out here.

54
00:03:00,787 --> 00:03:03,621
But I didn't mean
to embarrass you.

55
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:05,490
Yeah, you never do.

56
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:56,274
- Barbara?!
- Stay here.

57
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:08,019
Barbara!

58
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:12,924
Barbara!

59
00:04:12,926 --> 00:04:15,860
Barbara?

60
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:24,602
Hey!

61
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:35,213
Thomas! Thomas!

62
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:39,217
No! No!

63
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:43,988
No...

00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:06,344
Morning, sunshine.

67
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:07,412
Hey.

68
00:05:07,414 --> 00:05:08,513
What you looking at?

69
00:05:08,515 --> 00:05:11,249
Porn? Sex tapes?
Nip slips?

70
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:13,685
The Internet is more
than just naked people.

71
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:14,919
You do know that, right?

72
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:16,120
Not <i>my</i> Internet.

73
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,490
All right.
Check this out.

74
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:21,359
So, this girl --
her body was found

75
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:24,462
just outside
Big Creek State Park in Iowa.

76
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:25,930
Uh, covered in bite marks.

77
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:27,999
The police are saying
it's an animal attack.

78
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,133
But...?

79
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:30,835
But I did some digging,

80
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:34,372
and I found that
there weren't a lot of bodies,

81
00:05:34,374 --> 00:05:36,374
but a lot of people
do go missing in that park.

82
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:38,509
Look at this.
Park ranger back in '06.

83
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:42,180
A poacher in '98.
And on and on and on.

84
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:43,948
I mean, I've only
gone back to 1943,

85
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,983
and I've already found
54 missing people.

86
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:47,385
- Wow.
- Yeah.

87
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:49,353
Yeah. Sounds like
our kind of thing.

88
00:05:49,355 --> 00:05:50,788
You sure you're up for it?

89
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,957
I mean, I know you wanted
to take some time.

90
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,059
No, I-I'm -- I'm good.

91
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:57,061
Honestly, I-I'm good.

92
00:05:57,063 --> 00:05:59,197
All right.
Well, let's hit it.

93
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,465
You got it.
I'll grab Cass.

94
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:02,533
Mm. He actually left.

95
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:03,735
What?
Early this morning.

96
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:05,002
Why?
I don't know.

97
00:06:05,004 --> 00:06:06,370
Something about
being cooped up

98
00:06:06,372 --> 00:06:07,905
in the bunker
for a few weeks.

99
00:06:07,907 --> 00:06:09,907
We all need to stretch
our legs. I get it.

100
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:12,744
All right.
Uh, then, Jack.

101
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:14,479
Uh...

102
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:16,347
I don't want Jack on this.

103
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:19,016
I thought you said Donatello
gave him the all clear?

104
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:21,018
Yeah, he did.

105
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,487
And I'm --
I'm sure he's good.

106
00:06:22,489 --> 00:06:24,088
But...

107
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,923
Jack's got his mojo back.

108
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:27,692
His powers have gotten us
in trouble in the past --

109
00:06:27,694 --> 00:06:29,694
the security guard.

110
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:32,897
So I just want to make sure
that, you know,

111
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:35,600
he's right before we put him
back out there.

112
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:39,337
Yeah. Yeah.

113
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:49,013
- Hey, uh...good reading?
- Yes.

114
00:06:49,015 --> 00:06:51,783
Did you know Article 246
of the Haitian criminal code

115
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:53,284
officially makes it
against the law

116
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:55,553
to turn a human
into a zombie?

117
00:06:55,555 --> 00:06:57,455
Good.

118
00:06:57,457 --> 00:07:00,925
Jack, listen. Dean and I are
heading out on a case.

119
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:04,362
And...you don't
want me to come?

120
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:05,696
Look, truth is --

121
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:07,198
We don't want to leave
the bunker empty.

122
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,467
In case, uh, Mom or...

123
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:13,204
some of the other Hunters call
and need help, so...

124
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:16,541
And this place is long overdue
for a restock.

125
00:07:16,543 --> 00:07:20,378
So, uh, your mission,
should you choose to accept --

126
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,346
made you a list.

127
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,886
My mission is shopping?

128
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:33,925
Beer, TP, eggs...

129
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:35,092
beer again.

130
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:37,628
- Twice?
- Yeah.

131
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:42,834
I'll do it.

132
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:44,335
Great!

133
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,605
We'll be in touch.

134
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:58,015
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:58,017 --> 00:08:01,252
I just don't really see
how this is an FBI thing.

136
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:02,920
Wildlife preserve
is government property.

137
00:08:02,922 --> 00:08:04,188
We're the government.

138
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,591
Yeah, well, it is
a large piece of land --

139
00:08:06,593 --> 00:08:08,626
coyotes, rough terrain.

140
00:08:08,628 --> 00:08:10,795
We try to limit hikers
to the trails,

141
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:12,964
but some of them
don't listen.

142
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:16,267
Okay, but the girl who died,
she wasn't a hiker.

143
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:18,202
Do you know what
happened to her?

144
00:08:20,974 --> 00:08:22,907
Like I said, coyotes.

145
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:27,311
You know, do you mind
if we take a look at the body?

146
00:08:27,313 --> 00:08:28,880
Do I have a choice?

147
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:30,882
Not really.

148
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:41,292
Whoa! Mo--

149
00:08:41,294 --> 00:08:43,327
Seriously?

150
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:44,996
How long you been
doing this?

151
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:48,466
Well, got catlike reflexes,
okay? What can I say?

152
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:55,139
Said a coyote did this?

153
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:57,008
Not even close.
Mnh-mnh.

154
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,977
Look at the skin
around the bite.

155
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:02,079
It looks...burnt.

156
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:04,482
So, what the hell
can do that?

157
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:27,104
? <i>We face them all, ghost!</i> ?

158
00:09:27,106 --> 00:09:28,940
? <i>Ghostfacers!</i> ?

159
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:31,542
? <i>We face the faceless,</i>
<i>we face the dead!</i> ?

160
00:09:31,544 --> 00:09:33,577
Eliot, stop.

161
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:35,913
What? The Ghostfacers
are cool.

162
00:09:35,915 --> 00:09:37,748
No.
They're really not.

163
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,952
<i>Pure power at hand...</i>

164
00:09:40,954 --> 00:09:42,420
Uh...

165
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:44,255
Is that
what's his name?

166
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:45,623
Bambi?

167
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,525
Hey!

168
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:52,330
Hello.

169
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:54,565
Are you lost?

170
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:56,901
Um...

171
00:09:56,903 --> 00:09:58,636
no.

172
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:01,472
<i>Shoot that ghost right</i>
<i>in the face! Boo-yah!</i>

173
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:03,207
<i>Winchesters still</i>
<i>suck ass, though.</i>

174
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:04,475
<i>Affirmative.</i>

175
00:10:04,477 --> 00:10:07,044
You live with
Sam and Dean, right?

176
00:10:07,046 --> 00:10:10,314
They're not here
right now.

177
00:10:10,316 --> 00:10:12,083
Are they
fighting ghosts?!

178
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:14,218
What's a ghost?

179
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,453
I should go.

180
00:10:15,455 --> 00:10:17,421
Hey, it's...cool.

181
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,292
We know.

182
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:23,728
About their whole
Hunter thing.

183
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,630
Oh. Good.

184
00:10:26,632 --> 00:10:28,566
I don't like to lie.

185
00:10:28,568 --> 00:10:30,434
It makes my stomach hurt.

186
00:10:30,436 --> 00:10:34,171
Like when you have to burp,
but you can't burp.

187
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,209
Yeah.

188
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,946
So, you need
something?

189
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:44,281
I do,
but the store's closed.

190
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:48,352
Not anymore.

191
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,128
Hey!

192
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,829
Come in.

193
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:01,966
You okay?

194
00:11:05,772 --> 00:11:07,038
No.

195
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,510
I think I should
talk to them.

196
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:14,779
Who?

197
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:17,148
Barbara's parents.

198
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:22,486
Tom, that's not
a good idea.

199
00:11:22,488 --> 00:11:25,122
I've already spoken to them.
They're grieving.

200
00:11:25,124 --> 00:11:27,491
Dad.

201
00:11:27,493 --> 00:11:28,959
This was my fault.

202
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:31,128
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

203
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:39,003
Tom, they just need
a little time.

204
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:41,839
We all do.

205
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:58,089
I feel...
bad for him.

206
00:11:58,091 --> 00:12:00,057
Same.

207
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:03,727
I mean, living with
a bunch of dudes.

208
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:07,665
Their whole place must smell
like beer, Kleenex,

209
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:11,602
and
Old Spice.

210
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,207
I've been watching these guys
called the Ghostfacers.

211
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:17,374
You heard of 'em?

212
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:18,542
No.

213
00:12:18,544 --> 00:12:20,511
They're awesome!

214
00:12:20,513 --> 00:12:24,281
They know all about ghosts,
and I'm reading books.

215
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:27,251
Oh, I like books, too.
I'm reading about zombies.

216
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:28,619
Zombies are real?

217
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:32,189
Well, no.
Not really.

218
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:33,924
It's kind of
disappointing.

219
00:12:33,926 --> 00:12:36,427
- But there are other monsters.
- Like what?

220
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:39,029
Oh, vampires, werewolves,
shapeshifters --

221
00:12:39,031 --> 00:12:41,465
I've seen one of those --
djinn, rugaru --

222
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:45,035
That's a funny name. Yeah.

223
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:48,739
Wraiths, sirens, demons, ghouls.
All sorts of things.

224
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:51,642
And you know
about <i>all</i> of them?

225
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:55,412
Well...yes.

226
00:12:55,414 --> 00:12:59,250
Jack, will you be
my best friend?

227
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:01,785
Dude, stop stalking him.
Sorry.

228
00:13:01,787 --> 00:13:03,754
Ever since he found out
about this stuff,

229
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:04,889
he's been obsessed.

230
00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:06,090
It's fine.

231
00:13:06,092 --> 00:13:09,393
Do you ever,
like, hang out?

232
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:11,762
Well, we have movie nights
on Tuesdays.

233
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:13,831
Dean usually picks.

234
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,400
I've seen "Lost Boys"
like 36 times.

235
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:18,636
I mean with kids
your own age.

236
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:19,970
Well, I'm two.

237
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:24,441
...enty.

238
00:13:24,443 --> 00:13:26,610
I'm twenty.

239
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:29,947
Two.

240
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:34,118
I'm twenty two.

241
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:38,289
Okay.

242
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,658
Well, we're going
to the Stoke place tomorrow,

243
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,092
if you wanna chill.

244
00:13:42,094 --> 00:13:45,162
It's this old farmhouse
outside of town.

245
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:48,799
No one goes there.

246
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:51,669
So we can talk
about monsters.

247
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:53,971
And other
non-freak things.

248
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,776
I...

249
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:00,511
I think I'd like that.

250
00:14:02,181 --> 00:14:04,348
It's $37.08.

251
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,483
But for the beer,
I need to see some ID.

252
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:12,990
ID?

253
00:14:22,835 --> 00:14:24,735
Kohonta.

254
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:26,470
Gesundheit.

255
00:14:26,472 --> 00:14:28,739
No, not --

256
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:30,307
Kohonta.

257
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:32,409
It's a -- It's a local
Native American legend.

258
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:35,045
I can't find much about it,
but they're sort of...

259
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:37,248
twisted monsters
that roam the woods

260
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,684
"driven to consume
sweet mortal flesh."

261
00:14:40,686 --> 00:14:42,920
- You think this is our Hot Lips?
- Could be.

262
00:14:42,922 --> 00:14:44,555
I mean, according
to the lore,

263
00:14:44,557 --> 00:14:47,992
Kohonta get so starving,
they spit up stomach acid.

264
00:14:47,994 --> 00:14:49,393
Mm. Gross.

265
00:14:49,395 --> 00:14:50,661
Yeah.

266
00:14:50,663 --> 00:14:52,930
If that is our monster,
it's old...

267
00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:55,599
and...
hungry.

268
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:14,385
How much longer?

269
00:15:14,387 --> 00:15:16,487
Keep up, old man.

270
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:27,197
What was that?

271
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,034
Nothing.
It's just the wind.

272
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,013
We should head back.

273
00:15:57,129 --> 00:15:58,562
Sara?

274
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:04,768
Hey!
Who the hell are you?!

275
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:11,008
I'm talking to <i>you,</i> freak!
I --

276
00:16:12,478 --> 00:16:14,678
Sara, run!

277
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:51,388
Hey, did you know when some
animals get a taste of people,

278
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,090
that's all
they'll want to hunt?

279
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:55,759
I mean, I'm reading on here
that tigers, even bears --

280
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,028
Tom, you've got to stop.

281
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,130
You won't let me talk
to Barbara's parents.

282
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:02,599
I have to do <i>something.</i>

283
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:04,301
You said it was
a coyote, right?

284
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:07,638
Barbara!

285
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:11,241
Yeah. It was.

286
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:16,079
Sheriff, there's a...
situation at Big Creek.

287
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:21,919
It got somebody else,
didn't it?

288
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:33,430
But did --
did they find him?

289
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:35,332
No, not yet.

290
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:39,436
Sara, what did you
see out there?

291
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:42,339
There was this guy.

292
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:44,942
I think...it was a guy.

293
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:48,679
He looked like he was
covered in something.

294
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:50,848
And...

295
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,883
he was whistling.

296
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:56,587
I ran, but Fitz, he...

297
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:58,956
Can you tell us
exactly where you were

298
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,458
when this thing
attacked you?

299
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:05,429
I think...

300
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:08,298
a few miles past
the old Parker cabin.

301
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,867
Parker?

302
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:20,978
Okay, wrap it up!

303
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,547
Sheriff, we've got
a search party out there.

304
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:26,650
Not anymore. You're bringing
everybody in. Now.

305
00:18:26,652 --> 00:18:27,985
What's going on?

306
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:30,687
What does it look like?
We're done here.

307
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:33,824
I'm not wasting time and money
hunting for a rabid coyote.

308
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:35,959
Okay, Sheriff, this wasn't
an animal attack.

309
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:37,628
Then what was it?

310
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,496
Look, if you want to pull your
men out of there, that's fine.

311
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:40,697
But we still need
to get in there.

312
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:42,065
It's not happening.

313
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,301
Look, I don't care
if you guys are the FBI.

314
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:47,337
Nobody goes in those woods
without my say-so.

315
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:49,673
Understood?
Mm-hmm.

316
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:51,675
- Hm.
- Good.

317
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:53,810
He wants us to call off...

318
00:18:53,812 --> 00:18:56,380
Well, we should probably
do what he says.

319
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:59,149
Oh, yeah.
Definitely.

320
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:02,753
We're done.

321
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:04,488
? <i>It was love</i> ?

322
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,690
? <i>It was real</i> ?

323
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:11,028
I'm gonna fail.

324
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,031
I'm gonna fail
the SATs.

325
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:15,933
No way.

326
00:19:15,935 --> 00:19:19,670
I mean, you get 400 points just
for spelling your name right.

327
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:21,738
Mmm.

328
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,342
So, I mean...
you'll at least get that.

329
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:26,576
Probably.

330
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:27,945
- Maybe.
- Shut up!

331
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:32,683
It's not my fault you're so cute
when you're angry.

332
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:34,685
? <i>It was love</i> ?

333
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:37,187
? <i>It was real</i> ?

334
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:40,123
If you two are going to kiss,
can you go to the other room?

335
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,124
- Myeh!
- Hmm...

336
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:43,226
I'm trying
to work here.

337
00:19:43,228 --> 00:19:45,629
Okay. Chill.

338
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:49,533
Come in.

339
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:52,903
Jack. You came.

340
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:54,571
Yeah.
You invited me.

341
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:57,374
Yeah. We know.

342
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,977
- Are these --
- Books.

343
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:01,411
On monsters.

344
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:03,246
Awesome.

345
00:20:03,248 --> 00:20:06,817
? <i>...again</i> ?

346
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:09,619
? <i>Can you teach me</i>
<i>how to love again?</i> ?

347
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:15,993
What's that?

348
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:21,465
Music?

349
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:24,001
- I like The Who.
- Who?

350
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:26,603
Oh, my aunt
listens to them.

351
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:28,839
They're...old.

352
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:32,943
Well, Dean says any music
made after 1979 "sucks ass."

353
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:35,078
That's because Dean
is also old.

354
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:41,184
Sit down.

355
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:49,526
? <i>But it was love</i> ?

356
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:51,995
? <i>It was real</i> ?

357
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:55,399
What's the sat?

358
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:01,271
The...SAT's?

359
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:06,243
You were
homeschooled, huh?

360
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:09,780
Uh...yes.

361
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:11,314
Whoa.

362
00:21:11,316 --> 00:21:15,118
Do demons really
look like this?

363
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,787
Uh...

364
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:19,356
No.
They don't have horns.

365
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:21,324
They actually
look like smoke,

366
00:21:21,326 --> 00:21:23,727
unless they've
possessed a human.

367
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:28,698
Then, they can look
like me or you...

368
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,167
or anybody.

369
00:21:32,337 --> 00:21:34,471
Really?

370
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:37,841
And you've
seen one before?

371
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:44,314
I've killed one.

372
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:49,019
Yeah?

373
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:51,888
How?

374
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:56,493
<i>This</i> is an angel blade.

375
00:21:56,495 --> 00:21:59,029
So...it's made
out of angels?

376
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:02,199
Uh, no, it kills
angels and demons.

377
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:04,534
- Cool.
- Hey! Unh-unh!

378
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:07,270
You're not going to go swinging
some giant knife around.

379
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:08,738
- I was just gonna --
- Remember that time

380
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,373
you almost killed yourself
with a Slinky?

381
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,741
I didn't.

382
00:22:11,743 --> 00:22:13,910
He tried to eat it.

383
00:22:13,912 --> 00:22:16,580
I was 3.

384
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:18,281
So, how do you use it?

385
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:22,886
Well, there are standard
hand-to-hand combat moves.

386
00:22:22,888 --> 00:22:24,554
Like a lightsaber.

387
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:28,458
Or you can throw it,
like...this.

388
00:22:32,397 --> 00:22:34,764
Nice.

389
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:57,754
That sheriff was definitely
hiding something.

390
00:22:57,756 --> 00:22:59,656
Yeah, either that
or he's scared.

391
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:03,727
Oh, by the way, uh,
"Kohonta" means "whistler."

392
00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:05,762
All right.
How do we kill it?

393
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:09,232
Well, here's the thing.
The lore doesn't really specify.

394
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:13,937
Great. Well, my vote?
Shotgun, head, done.

395
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:39,663
Drop your weapons!

396
00:23:49,508 --> 00:23:51,374
You boys don't listen,
do you?

397
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:53,443
Told you.
Stay out of these woods!

398
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:55,212
I don't care
if you're FBI.

399
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:57,981
All right. Sheriff.
We're not FBI.

400
00:23:57,983 --> 00:24:00,150
Does the word "Kohonta"
mean anything to you?

401
00:24:04,523 --> 00:24:06,556
No.

402
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:09,492
- You're lyin'.
- I'm not.

403
00:24:09,494 --> 00:24:11,628
You're coming in with me.

404
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,563
Move.

405
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:15,232
Now!

406
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,174
Sorry, Sheriff.

407
00:24:28,213 --> 00:24:30,247
Getting closer.

408
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:32,349
I-I'm just
a little rusty.

409
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:33,717
Mm-hmm.

410
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,352
It's cool if you
can't do it, dude.

411
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:37,387
I can do it, okay?

412
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:40,357
Just...watch.

413
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,934
- What...
- The... - Hell?

414
00:24:57,075 --> 00:24:58,441
Dude!

415
00:24:58,443 --> 00:25:00,844
Are you like...

416
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:02,712
a Jedi or something?

417
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:03,880
Kinda.

418
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:07,617
Watch this.

419
00:25:28,573 --> 00:25:30,140
Holy...

420
00:25:39,318 --> 00:25:42,419
This is so cool.

421
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:47,724
Max?

422
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:50,293
Uh...

423
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:51,995
Okay, Jack.
Cut it out.

424
00:25:51,997 --> 00:25:54,931
Don't worry. You're safe.
Look.

425
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:57,500
Whoa. Jack.

426
00:25:57,502 --> 00:25:59,002
I can control it.

427
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:01,604
I don't care!
Just stop!

428
00:26:01,606 --> 00:26:03,573
Jack?

429
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:04,808
What?

430
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:09,012
Seriously, Jack!
Stop!

431
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:10,113
Stacy!

432
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:23,760
No, no, no, no, no, no.

433
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:30,967
- Stacy!
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

434
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:34,804
It's okay, it's okay.

435
00:26:36,641 --> 00:26:39,309
E-Eliot, go call 911.

436
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:42,979
It's okay.
You stay with me, okay?

437
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:44,314
Please.

438
00:26:44,316 --> 00:26:45,648
I was in control.

439
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,650
E-Everything was fine.
She moved.

440
00:26:47,652 --> 00:26:50,053
Get away from her!

441
00:26:50,055 --> 00:26:51,454
<i>911.</i>
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

442
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:55,158
Stacy. It's okay.
I'm here. Okay? Okay?

443
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,460
Stacy. Please.

444
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,829
I can fix this.

445
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:05,335
What are you doing?!

446
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:06,736
Trust me. Okay.

447
00:27:25,924 --> 00:27:28,858
<i>Sir? Sir? Hello?</i>
<i>Are you still there?</i>

448
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,896
Stace?

449
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:49,412
How?

450
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:51,915
I-I fixed you.

451
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,525
Don't.

452
00:28:04,729 --> 00:28:09,065
But she's okay.
Everything's fine. Right?

453
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:10,700
No!

454
00:28:10,702 --> 00:28:13,236
Okay?
Just...get away.

455
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,413
Eliot?

456
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:26,549
I don't know...

457
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:28,384
<i>what</i> you are.

458
00:28:31,823 --> 00:28:33,823
But stay away.

459
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:46,998
We hunt things.

460
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,434
Fight things and kill things
people don't understand.

461
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,003
So...

462
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:53,504
Kohonta.

463
00:28:53,506 --> 00:28:55,640
Talk.

464
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,013
Uh...

465
00:29:02,015 --> 00:29:03,481
I-I...

466
00:29:03,483 --> 00:29:05,416
I didn't think
it was real.

467
00:29:05,418 --> 00:29:09,454
The Kohonta was a tribal legend,
an old story.

468
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,356
I haven't heard about it
since I was a kid.

469
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:13,958
But then I s-saw it

470
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,694
the night
Barbara was killed.

471
00:29:18,198 --> 00:29:20,231
Wait a second.
So that's why you've been

472
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:22,233
trying to keep people
out of the woods?

473
00:29:22,235 --> 00:29:23,901
So what the hell
is this thing?

474
00:29:23,903 --> 00:29:28,039
It's not <i>what.</i> Who.

475
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:32,210
The Parker family,
they were some

476
00:29:32,212 --> 00:29:35,146
of the first white settlers
around here.

477
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,883
They set a homestead up
in these woods -- the cabin.

478
00:29:38,885 --> 00:29:40,718
And then?

479
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,154
Things went bad.

480
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,957
There was a hard winter.

481
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:50,328
Their oldest son, Henry,
survived...

482
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,230
but he did things.

483
00:29:52,232 --> 00:29:54,832
What kind of things?
Like Donner Party?

484
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,334
Pretty much.

485
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,103
They say that boy
not only ate his family,

486
00:29:59,105 --> 00:30:03,741
they said he went...
mad with hunger.

487
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,945
He went after my people,

488
00:30:07,947 --> 00:30:10,848
and then when my tribe
caught him, they...

489
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:17,422
Killing him
would have been too easy.

490
00:30:17,424 --> 00:30:20,525
They wanted that boy to suffer.

491
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,694
For his crimes
against our people,

492
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,796
crimes against nature.

493
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:27,465
They cursed him.

494
00:30:28,835 --> 00:30:30,201
He's doomed
to roam the woods...

495
00:30:32,272 --> 00:30:34,138
...always starving.

496
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:37,275
And if he didn't feed...

497
00:30:39,813 --> 00:30:41,879
...his body would eat itself.

498
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,553
The Kohonta aren't born.

499
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,057
They're made.

500
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,127
So they just let some
flesh-eating freak loose?

501
00:30:56,129 --> 00:30:58,963
They bound him
to this forest.

502
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:01,466
They marked the trees
to keep folks away.

503
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:03,301
But that was
a long time ago.

504
00:31:03,303 --> 00:31:04,669
Yeah, people forget.

505
00:31:04,671 --> 00:31:06,637
- Even me.
- Well, it's a good thing.

506
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:08,673
Like I said,
we hunt these things.

507
00:31:08,675 --> 00:31:12,376
- What do you mean?
- Kohonta, werewolves, demons.

508
00:31:12,378 --> 00:31:14,266
Those are real?

509
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:17,602
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And we kill 'em.

510
00:31:17,604 --> 00:31:19,204
You --
Just the two of you?

511
00:31:19,206 --> 00:31:21,272
- We know what we're doing.
- Do you?

512
00:31:21,274 --> 00:31:23,408
Look, if those monsters
are out there,

513
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,909
why don't you tell people?

514
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:27,879
Give them -- well, us --
a chance to fight back?

515
00:31:29,216 --> 00:31:31,716
Because telling people
about this stuff --

516
00:31:31,718 --> 00:31:33,518
they don't always believe.

517
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,753
Your people tried to warn you
about this whistling freak.

518
00:31:35,755 --> 00:31:37,789
Nobody bought it.
Not even you.

519
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:39,357
So?

520
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,893
Just record them,
put it on YouTube.

521
00:31:41,895 --> 00:31:43,862
Knowing about monsters
and fighting 'em

522
00:31:43,864 --> 00:31:45,230
are two different things.

523
00:31:45,232 --> 00:31:47,465
So you make that choice
for everybody?

524
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:49,234
Imagine telling them.

525
00:31:49,236 --> 00:31:51,269
Imagine the lives
you could save.

526
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:54,706
No. No.

527
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:57,475
It doesn't work
like that.

528
00:31:57,477 --> 00:31:59,577
People die.

529
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:01,779
Even when they know
how to fight,

530
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:03,581
people still die.

531
00:32:13,593 --> 00:32:15,960
Tom.

532
00:32:15,962 --> 00:32:18,329
- I can't do this anymore.
- Where are you?

533
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:19,764
<i>Just listen.</i>

534
00:32:19,766 --> 00:32:23,401
Whatever's out there...
I just want you to know

535
00:32:23,403 --> 00:32:25,403
I'm going to find it...

536
00:32:25,405 --> 00:32:27,672
and kill it.
Tom!

537
00:32:27,674 --> 00:32:29,674
<i>No! To--</i>

538
00:32:51,031 --> 00:32:53,631
He's alone out there.
We gotta find him.

539
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:55,500
- Okay, slow down.
- Look, I-I lied to him.

540
00:32:55,502 --> 00:32:57,302
I told him
it was a coyote.

541
00:32:57,304 --> 00:32:59,137
Listen. We're gonna help you
protect your son, okay?

542
00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:00,772
We're not entirely sure
how to kill this thing.

543
00:33:00,774 --> 00:33:02,340
I am. Look.

544
00:33:02,342 --> 00:33:05,143
The story says a silver blade
through the heart.

545
00:33:05,145 --> 00:33:08,780
Silver blade. Can do.

546
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,235
Thomas!

547
00:35:48,237 --> 00:35:49,970
Thomas!

548
00:36:06,221 --> 00:36:08,588
Hey!

549
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:20,968
Aaah!

550
00:36:47,363 --> 00:36:49,262
Go! Go!

551
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,100
Whoa.

552
00:36:53,102 --> 00:36:56,803
You don't like that, huh?
Come on!

553
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,776
Yeah.

554
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:04,177
Come on, come on.

555
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:06,613
Aaah!

556
00:37:28,303 --> 00:37:29,903
Whoa.

557
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:35,008
That was like
full-on "Raiders."

558
00:37:36,845 --> 00:37:38,011
Tom.

559
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,551
He's alive.

560
00:37:56,271 --> 00:37:58,038
- Easy.
- D-Dad?

561
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,373
Thomas.

562
00:38:01,176 --> 00:38:03,310
Did we get it?

563
00:38:03,312 --> 00:38:05,178
The coyote?

564
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:10,684
- Okay...ready?
- Yeah.

565
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:15,722
You want an ambulance
for <i>you?</i>

566
00:38:17,393 --> 00:38:19,526
I didn't know
what to tell him.

567
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,230
How about the truth?

568
00:38:24,366 --> 00:38:26,500
He's your son.

569
00:38:29,004 --> 00:38:30,871
He deserves the truth.

570
00:38:55,197 --> 00:38:58,765
So, telling the kid --
you think that's the best idea?

571
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:01,768
What? You don't?

572
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:04,237
It doesn't make his life
any better, you know?

573
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:07,207
Do what we always do.
When in doubt, lie.

574
00:39:07,209 --> 00:39:09,876
Yeah, right.

575
00:39:09,878 --> 00:39:12,446
Like we did with Jack?

576
00:39:12,448 --> 00:39:14,548
I took care of it, okay?
We took care of it.

577
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,316
No, no, Dean.
<i>We</i> did not take care of it.

578
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:18,652
<i>You</i> did.

579
00:39:18,654 --> 00:39:21,955
And do you think you really
took care of it the right way?

580
00:39:21,957 --> 00:39:23,723
Jack said he was fine.

581
00:39:23,725 --> 00:39:25,992
Yeah. He's a kid.

582
00:39:25,994 --> 00:39:27,727
And when we were kids,

583
00:39:27,729 --> 00:39:29,663
how many times did we tell Dad
that we were fine

584
00:39:29,665 --> 00:39:32,098
just to make him happy?

585
00:39:57,926 --> 00:40:00,494
Hey, kid.
We're back.

586
00:40:00,496 --> 00:40:01,761
You still at it?

587
00:40:01,763 --> 00:40:04,164
Almost there.
How was the Hunt?

588
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:07,200
Oh.
Uh...disgusting.

589
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:10,303
Oh. Well, I got
the supplies.

590
00:40:10,305 --> 00:40:13,340
Except for the beer.

591
00:40:13,342 --> 00:40:14,674
I didn't have ID.

592
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:16,643
- You have tons of IDs.
- They're fake.

593
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,948
Jack...listen.

594
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,050
Dean and I, we --
we want to talk to you

595
00:40:24,052 --> 00:40:26,019
about your powers.

596
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:27,821
W-What about them?

597
00:40:27,823 --> 00:40:30,357
This Hunt, we, uh...
we didn't want you coming along

598
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:32,626
because we didn't
want you using them.

599
00:40:32,628 --> 00:40:36,062
Not yet.
Not for now.

600
00:40:36,064 --> 00:40:38,331
You know, you just
got 'em back, Jack.

601
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:40,233
We want to make sure you're
comfortable with them again

602
00:40:40,235 --> 00:40:41,635
before you...

603
00:40:41,637 --> 00:40:43,236
Before you go
all X-Men.

604
00:40:44,673 --> 00:40:46,506
It was crappy of us
not to tell you.

605
00:40:46,508 --> 00:40:48,808
You know, we were
trying to be nice.

606
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,477
'Cause we care
about you.

607
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:53,580
But because we care about you,
you deserve the truth.

608
00:40:58,253 --> 00:41:00,253
You understand that?

609
00:41:04,726 --> 00:41:06,293
Jack?

610
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:10,564
I understand.

611
00:41:10,566 --> 00:41:14,668
I won't use my powers
without permission.

612
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,837
Promise.

613
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,439
Great.

614
00:41:19,441 --> 00:41:21,942
And I guess I'll go
get some beer.

615
00:41:26,782 --> 00:41:28,548
What about everything else?
You good?

616
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,550
I mean, anything happen
while we were gone?

617
00:41:30,552 --> 00:41:32,018
No.

618
00:41:34,022 --> 00:41:35,555
Nothin'.

619
00:41:35,557 --> 00:41:37,357
Good.
