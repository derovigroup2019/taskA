1
00:00:00,076 --> 00:00:01,827
You know my brother thinks
you can be saved.

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:02,895
You don't believe that.

3
00:00:02,897 --> 00:00:03,863
No, I don't.

4
00:00:03,865 --> 00:00:05,197
And it comes to
killing you,

5
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:06,665
I'll be the one to do it.

6
00:00:08,402 --> 00:00:09,969
No.

7
00:00:09,971 --> 00:00:11,170
Aah!

8
00:00:11,172 --> 00:00:12,671
I just need your power.

9
00:00:16,844 --> 00:00:19,345
I know this must be
so hard without your grace,

10
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:20,596
but you can get past this.

11
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:24,767
You did good, kid.

12
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:25,884
I was right.

13
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:27,052
You're pretty smart
sometimes.

14
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:32,487
Jack?!

15
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:36,157
I don't understand
how Lucifer could die

16
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,242
and I could live...

17
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:39,360
Aaah!

18
00:00:39,362 --> 00:00:42,196
...how I would let
Lucifer possess me.

19
00:00:42,198 --> 00:00:43,548
You were in a lot of pain.

20
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,533
I'm gonna find out
who killed my family.

21
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:49,421
I thought I saw something,
but I was wrong.

22
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:51,556
I don't know anything.

23
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:52,807
I think you do.

24
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:59,481
I know I've got issues.

25
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:02,317
It's not like I want
to do this, okay?

26
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:04,102
I need to.

27
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:06,888
I know I should stop.

28
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,391
It's just that...

29
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:15,563
these feelings afterward...

30
00:01:15,565 --> 00:01:18,700
I hate.

31
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:22,037
I hate

32
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:26,591
that it feels so good.

33
00:01:26,593 --> 00:01:29,794
Anyway, I know I've taken up
too much of your time.

34
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,467
If you say you can't tell me

35
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:39,087
what Arty told you during
confession, I accept that.

36
00:01:39,089 --> 00:01:42,524
Of course, he was the only
witness to my family's murder,

37
00:01:42,526 --> 00:01:44,726
but I understand you got
your vows to keep and all that,

38
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,146
but...

39
00:01:48,148 --> 00:01:49,948
You really shoulda helped me.

40
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:54,069
Okay?

41
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:58,373
So you brought this
on yourself.

42
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:01,326
But, look, I will take
some of your advice.

43
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:03,294
Perhaps...

44
00:02:03,296 --> 00:02:04,996
Perhaps the peace
I'm looking for

45
00:02:04,998 --> 00:02:08,666
does lie in the power of prayer.

46
00:02:08,668 --> 00:02:11,619
And I do agree with you, Padre.

47
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:13,788
There is a Devil,

48
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,642
and we should try to fight him.

49
00:02:17,644 --> 00:02:19,561
Sometimes we just can't.

50
00:02:22,232 --> 00:02:23,932
Hang in there.

- What's taking so long?
- I don't know.

54
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,737
Whatever's going on with Jack
is probably complicated.

55
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,990
Yeah, but, I mean, weird stuff
happens to kids all the time.

56
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:25,493
They get coughs,
bloody noses.

57
00:03:27,497 --> 00:03:28,546
Is he okay?

58
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:32,333
I -- I did what I could,
but I don't --

59
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:36,370
I -- I don't know what's
wrong with him.

60
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:38,590
But you can figure it out,
right?

61
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:42,710
Jack?

62
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:43,761
Jack?

63
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,433
Hey.

64
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:50,318
Jack!

65
00:03:56,526 --> 00:03:58,359
I need a doctor!

66
00:03:58,361 --> 00:03:59,611
Hey.

67
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:04,732
Look, could you just
get him inside?

68
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:06,067
Sir, I just need
some basic information.

69
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:07,401
That's the procedure.

70
00:04:07,403 --> 00:04:09,003
I do the work-up,
then I take him back.

71
00:04:09,005 --> 00:04:10,588
Okay, the basic information
is he's sick.

72
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,008
Do you see anyone here
who isn't?

73
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,245
His full name, please.

74
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:19,347
You do know his name,
right?

75
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:20,849
Jack.

76
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:27,722
Uh, uh, Kline.
Jack Kline.

77
00:04:27,724 --> 00:04:30,525
K-l-i-n-e.

78
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:31,559
Date of birth?

79
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:33,144
Come on.
Is that important?

80
00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:34,595
What did you say your
relationship is to the patient?

81
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:36,564
May 18th.

82
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:39,033
Date of birth --
May 18th.

83
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:43,437
2000 -- '99.

84
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,874
2000.

85
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:48,209
Uh-huh.
Family medical history?

86
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:50,912
Let's start with the father.

87
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:52,947
He's dead.

88
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:54,716
Cause of death?

89
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:58,419
He was stabbed through
the heart, and he exploded.

90
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,973
Okay, you know what?
We don't have time for this.

91
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:04,309
All right, he's sick.
His name is Jack Kline.

92
00:05:04,311 --> 00:05:05,510
His father exploded.

93
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:06,811
There, you've got
all the basics.

94
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:08,629
Now what does he need
to do to see a doctor?

95
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:09,931
Jack!

96
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:10,899
Jack?!

97
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,137
It's all right, Jack.
Hang in there, buddy.

98
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,405
Jack, hey, we're
right here, buddy.

99
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:20,108
He's in good hands.
Don't worry.

100
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:27,498
So, there's -- there's been...
Uh, he's been coughing. There's been blood.

101
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,514
Okay, gentlemen, can you at
least wait outside, please?

102
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:29,285
It's been going on for a while.

103
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:30,818
What's happened?
Is he gonna be okay?

104
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,453
- The doctor will handle it.
- Okay.

105
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:35,423
Jack, we're right here!

106
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,174
Nick?

107
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:27,759
Hello. Diane Fargo.

108
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:29,710
Hey, yeah.

109
00:06:29,712 --> 00:06:31,562
Yeah, you weren't easy
to track down.

110
00:06:31,564 --> 00:06:34,766
I left Pike Creek
six years ago.

111
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:36,889
I'm working at the <i>Tribune</i>
here in Wilmington.

112
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:37,486
Oh.

113
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:39,570
-What can I get you?
-Coffee, please.

114
00:06:39,572 --> 00:06:41,055
Well,
thanks for seeing me.

115
00:06:41,057 --> 00:06:44,692
I didn't think you were
gonna remember who I am.

116
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:46,244
Of course I do.

117
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:49,330
I spoke to you the morning
after your family was...

118
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:51,032
Slaughtered.

119
00:06:53,753 --> 00:06:57,422
And then you left town.

120
00:06:57,424 --> 00:06:59,791
Yeah, just...

121
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:03,344
I couldn't stay, you know?
Too much baggage.

122
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:06,481
I had to rebuild.

123
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:07,465
Thank you.

124
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:08,966
You're welcome.

125
00:07:08,968 --> 00:07:13,021
My ex-neighbor, Arty Nielsen,
was killed a few weeks ago.

126
00:07:13,023 --> 00:07:15,423
- Really?
- Yeah, so...

127
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:17,892
just brought back all kinds
of bad memories, you know,

128
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:22,313
and, uh, I was just
looking for some answers.

129
00:07:22,315 --> 00:07:24,032
To...?

130
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:27,068
My family.

131
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,236
The case was never solved.

132
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:29,603
The one witness was Arty,

133
00:07:29,605 --> 00:07:33,408
and he said that he
saw someone leaving my house

134
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,542
the night of the murders,

135
00:07:34,544 --> 00:07:36,494
and then he changed
his story.

136
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:38,446
It happens.

137
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:40,164
People say things
in the heat of the moment,

138
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,467
and then realize
they're not so sure.

139
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:44,719
Even you gave up
on the story.

140
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,390
There was almost no evidence
at the crime scene.

141
00:07:49,392 --> 00:07:50,508
Mm-hmm.

142
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,393
The cops had zero
to say to me.

143
00:07:52,395 --> 00:07:54,729
I even played with the idea
you did it, but you...

144
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:58,316
Well, I was getting hammered
at the Elks Lodge that night.

145
00:07:58,318 --> 00:08:01,102
So...I moved on.

146
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:07,024
Yeah, well, I can't.

147
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:08,076
Nick?

148
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:10,828
No, I'm good.

149
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,613
Seriously.

150
00:08:12,615 --> 00:08:15,083
As -- As soon as I figure out
what happened that night,

151
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:17,985
these demons will disappear.

152
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:22,623
Look, you were
a crime reporter, right?

153
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:26,928
So you've got to know all
the beat cops in Pike Creek.

154
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,162
Sure.

155
00:08:28,164 --> 00:08:29,847
Okay, do you happen to
remember who was assigned

156
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:33,267
to my neighborhood
that night?

157
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:35,520
I think so.
All right.

158
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:38,523
I'm...pretty sure

159
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:41,509
it was Frank --
Frank Kellogg.

160
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:42,777
Frank Kellogg.

161
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,612
Last I heard,
he was doing private security

162
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:47,148
up in Montauk.

163
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,535
Frank Kellogg, Montauk.

164
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:00,795
This is crazy.

165
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:02,547
When Jack became human,
I was worried, you know,

166
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:04,698
given what we do, that -- that
something would happen to him,

167
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,201
but I thought it'd be
a vampire or a ghoul,

168
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:09,137
not a friggin' cough.

169
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:10,638
He's just a kid.

170
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,974
Hey, hey, hey.

171
00:09:12,976 --> 00:09:14,058
Cass.

172
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,643
Doctor.

173
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:17,979
So, um...

174
00:09:17,981 --> 00:09:19,180
What do we know?

175
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:21,065
Well, I can tell you
what we don't know.

176
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:22,517
I don't like
the sound of that.

177
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,319
Jack's test results
all came back negative.

178
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:26,737
That's great, right?

179
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:30,658
Well, Jack --
he's very ill.

180
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,393
We're just not sure
what we're up against.

181
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:33,911
You just said his tests
came back negative.

182
00:09:33,913 --> 00:09:36,247
Well, those tests,
but we have to run more tests.

183
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:37,698
<i>More</i> tests?

184
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,250
Yes, until we can figure out
what's happening to him.

185
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:42,420
What is happening to him
right now?

186
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:44,005
Jack...

187
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:50,244
Jack's in total
systemic failure.

188
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:52,763
His body's in the process
of shutting down.

189
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:04,106
Lemme ask you a question.

190
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:06,008
How much longer
are we gonna give this?

191
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,709
How many more tests
are there gonna be?

192
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:10,579
My opinion?
I think we're done here.

193
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:12,297
Yeah, that was kinda
my opinion, too.

194
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:13,749
I mean, this place,
we tried,

195
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:15,484
but they've never seen
anything like Jack,

196
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:17,319
and we can't exactly
tell them what he is.

197
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:19,288
Then let's get
him out of here.

198
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,957
Let's bring him home.
Let's do what we do.

199
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,626
Let's find a way.

200
00:10:24,628 --> 00:10:27,029
Hell, I was even thinkin'
maybe Rowena...

201
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:28,814
Already called her.

202
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:40,359
Uh, what --
What's going on?

203
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:41,777
What's it look like?

204
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:43,662
You can't expect him to hit
the street with nothing on

205
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:45,414
but a hospital gown,
his ass hanging out.

206
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,648
He's not going anywhere.

207
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,317
We're just getting
a second opinion.

208
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:52,838
Jack?

209
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,625
We're getting a second opinion.

210
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:57,793
If he leaves the hospital,

211
00:10:57,795 --> 00:10:59,211
we are no longer responsible
for him.

212
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:00,662
You and he have to acknowledge

213
00:11:00,664 --> 00:11:02,214
that you're leaving
against medical advice.

214
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:04,883
- Fine.
- We're leaving.

215
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:09,855
Yeah, there's just no talkin'
to him when he gets like this.

216
00:11:09,857 --> 00:11:12,641
- Thanks for coming.
- I got here quick as I could.

217
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:13,942
How is he?

218
00:11:13,944 --> 00:11:15,027
Well, uh...

219
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:17,062
I brought the
Book of the Damned.

220
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:20,181
Which, uh, you stole.

221
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:22,985
Which I borrowed amidst
the ruckus

222
00:11:22,987 --> 00:11:24,853
of all those folks
arriving from the other world,

223
00:11:24,855 --> 00:11:26,321
but we can talk
about that later.

224
00:11:26,323 --> 00:11:28,624
Just how sick is Dean?

225
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:31,460
Yeah, about that, um...

226
00:11:31,462 --> 00:11:33,578
What?

227
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,963
Is this a trick?

228
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:36,632
Samuel, I thought
we were beyond this.

229
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:39,084
Somebody is sick,
all right, but...

230
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:41,703
Listen, I-I don't know how
well you got to know

231
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:43,338
our -- our --
our friend Jack

232
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,540
with everything that was
going on when you were here,

233
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:48,010
but we've sort of been
taking care of him,

234
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:52,014
and, uh, he's, um...

235
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:54,483
Lucifer's son.

236
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:55,717
Goodbye.

237
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,769
No, no, no. Stop, stop.
He's a great kid.

238
00:11:57,771 --> 00:12:00,405
His mother was
a fantastic human being,

239
00:12:00,407 --> 00:12:03,825
a-a-and he wanted nothing
to do with Lucifer,

240
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:05,894
w-who is dead,
as you know.

241
00:12:05,896 --> 00:12:07,195
I hope he's rotting.

242
00:12:07,197 --> 00:12:09,364
Yes, but Lucifer
stole Jack's grace,

243
00:12:09,366 --> 00:12:11,366
so he's powerless now,
and -- and something's

244
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:13,001
going on with him,
and he might die.

245
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:15,454
Oh, splendid!
The sooner the better!

246
00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:16,905
From what I know
of the father,

247
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:19,424
the world will be better off
without the son.

248
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:22,044
You might be right.

249
00:12:24,848 --> 00:12:27,883
We're all still
figuring that out.

250
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:33,221
I'm Jack.

251
00:12:33,223 --> 00:12:36,141
And I know people have
a lot of strong feelings

252
00:12:36,143 --> 00:12:39,111
about my father, but I'm --

253
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:42,447
I'm trying hard
not to be like him.

254
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:48,436
Sam and Dean, they -- they say
such nice things about you.

255
00:12:48,438 --> 00:12:50,238
They do?

256
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,042
You saved all of us --
from Apocalypse World.

257
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:57,112
Well, that's true.

258
00:12:57,114 --> 00:12:59,297
So, before you go,

259
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:02,000
I -- I just wanted to say...

260
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:03,635
thank you.

261
00:13:07,457 --> 00:13:08,757
Jack.

262
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:11,727
Hey, buddy. Hey.
You're all right.

263
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:14,813
Bollocks.

264
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:21,436
Possim rei huius cognoscere
causas...

265
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:29,077
Possim rei huius cognoscere
causas...

266
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:44,593
How am I?

267
00:13:56,557 --> 00:13:57,505
And?

268
00:13:57,507 --> 00:13:59,174
It's as I suspected.

269
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:00,976
A nephilim,
for all its power,

270
00:14:00,978 --> 00:14:02,510
is an unnatural presence.

271
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:03,945
Part human, part angel...

272
00:14:03,947 --> 00:14:07,015
It -- It doesn't quite fit.
It's delicate.

273
00:14:07,017 --> 00:14:09,067
Its grace is what
holds it in balance,

274
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:11,536
and when Jack's grace
was taken from him,

275
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:13,572
his being fell into chaos.

276
00:14:13,574 --> 00:14:16,374
The -- The cells
are gobbling each other up.

277
00:14:17,194 --> 00:14:20,662
Well, if it's grace he needs,
he can have mine.

278
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:22,998
No, dear, it won't do.

279
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,749
Jack is part archangel.

280
00:14:24,751 --> 00:14:27,469
He needs
a much stronger force

281
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:29,171
and probably
some kind of magic,

282
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:30,538
and he needs it quick.

283
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,307
- How quick?
- I don't...

284
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:35,894
I don't exactly know, but he's
enterin' a critical phase.

285
00:14:35,896 --> 00:14:37,545
Sometimes he'll look
just fine,

286
00:14:37,547 --> 00:14:41,216
but then his body
will give way and...

287
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:45,403
it'll be the end of him.

288
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:52,577
Hey.

289
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:09,010
Yeah, no.

290
00:15:09,012 --> 00:15:10,879
Wasn't sure which one you
thought would be the best one.

291
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:15,416
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

292
00:15:15,418 --> 00:15:17,302
Don't do it.

293
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:25,861
Evening.

294
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:28,697
Evening yourself.

295
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:29,898
You're out here alone?

296
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,450
That's sort of dangerous,
isn't it?

297
00:15:35,455 --> 00:15:38,373
Weird!
That sounded weird.

298
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,441
I just meant be safe.

299
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:43,578
Just hadda use my phone.
I'm headed back in.

300
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,580
Copy that.

301
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:48,083
Have fun.

302
00:15:55,058 --> 00:15:57,225
Did you wanna come in?

303
00:16:00,564 --> 00:16:02,597
Meet my friends...?

304
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:04,900
That sounds awesome,

305
00:16:04,902 --> 00:16:08,520
but it's a nice night,
and it's so loud in there.

306
00:16:08,522 --> 00:16:12,190
I know.
That's the best part.

307
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:14,159
Come on.
It'll be fun.

308
00:16:21,702 --> 00:16:24,586
Get away from me.

309
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:25,620
...what?

310
00:16:25,622 --> 00:16:28,173
Get away from me!

311
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:30,675
Now!

312
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:31,710
Go!

313
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,465
Hey, pal.
I brought you some carbs.

314
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:56,300
You, uh...

315
00:16:56,302 --> 00:16:59,670
You goin' somewhere?

316
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:03,039
Thought I'd go to Vegas.
Maybe Tahiti.

317
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,508
Okay.

318
00:17:05,728 --> 00:17:07,594
Nice.

319
00:17:07,596 --> 00:17:09,229
You think this is
the best time?

320
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:11,348
Pretty sure it is.

321
00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:14,852
Listen, Jack --

322
00:17:14,854 --> 00:17:15,903
Since I've been alive,

323
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:17,237
everyone assumed
I would be

324
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:20,357
this special "person"
who goes on forever.

325
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,860
Only now it looks like
forever

326
00:17:22,862 --> 00:17:24,895
might be a couple
of weeks, so --

327
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:26,947
We don't know that.

328
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:30,617
What I do know is
I'm done being special.

329
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:33,036
Before my life is over,

330
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:35,739
I want to live it.

331
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:39,426
I-I just want
a chance to...

332
00:17:39,428 --> 00:17:42,078
get a tan...

333
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,248
to see a hockey game...

334
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,934
get a parking ticket...

335
00:17:48,754 --> 00:17:51,021
...get bored...

336
00:17:51,023 --> 00:17:54,641
and when
it's all over...

337
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:55,776
die.

338
00:17:59,231 --> 00:18:01,982
So that's your plan,
huh?

339
00:18:01,984 --> 00:18:04,535
I don't want to
waste time arguing.

340
00:18:04,537 --> 00:18:06,703
I know you disagree.

341
00:18:06,705 --> 00:18:10,457
Did I say I disagree?

342
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:12,576
...and how likely
do you think that is?

343
00:18:12,578 --> 00:18:14,711
Because no Hunter I've spoken to
has heard of anything.

344
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:16,997
...I know you're not
speakin' to me, Magda,

345
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:19,449
basically no one
is speakin' to me,

346
00:18:19,451 --> 00:18:21,135
but I have a situation.

347
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:25,172
There's a wee nephilim
I know who's ailing...

348
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:27,290
Dean --

349
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:29,626
the bunker's vault has a number
of Enochian texts

350
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:33,697
on archangels, but nothing
on their half-human offspring.

351
00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:36,533
And I've spoken to some of the
greatest minds in witchcraft,

352
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:39,236
and they all say there's
nothing that'll help Jack.

353
00:18:39,238 --> 00:18:42,639
Well, then, they're not
the greatest minds, are they?

354
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:44,708
Well, I just got off
the phone with Ketch.

355
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,443
Um, he's got a line
on a shaman.

356
00:18:46,445 --> 00:18:47,578
A shaman?

357
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,046
Yeah,
the British Men of Letters

358
00:18:49,048 --> 00:18:50,848
used to use him --
as a consultant.

359
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,367
Whenever they needed to
"solve the unsolvable" --

360
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:55,169
he was their guy.

361
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:57,504
He's an expert in mysticism --

362
00:18:57,506 --> 00:18:59,590
esoteric divinity.

363
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:02,659
I mean, Ketch says
the Brits swore by him.

364
00:19:02,661 --> 00:19:04,294
Ketch "says."

365
00:19:04,296 --> 00:19:06,496
Yeah.

366
00:19:06,498 --> 00:19:08,682
His name is "Sergei,"
I-I got a location,

367
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:13,169
and Ketch says
he'll set up a meeting.

368
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:14,721
Okay, I'll go.

369
00:19:14,723 --> 00:19:17,641
You and Dean need to
stay here with, uh...

370
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:21,111
Jack, hey.

371
00:19:21,113 --> 00:19:22,479
W-What are you, uh --

372
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:25,181
We're -- We're headed out.

373
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:27,367
You're, uh...

374
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:29,236
Where?

375
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:32,456
We're takin' Baby
for some exercise.

376
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,709
You think that's
a good idea?

377
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:37,327
Yeah.

378
00:19:39,215 --> 00:19:41,582
Come on.

379
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:56,013
Hey.
Why don't you drive?

380
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:57,714
...what?

381
00:19:57,716 --> 00:19:59,883
Dean, I-I don't drive.

382
00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:01,685
Now you do.

383
00:20:04,189 --> 00:20:06,857
Okay, um...

384
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:09,109
Ah, ah, ah.
That "R" is not for "Race."

385
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:10,894
Put it in park.

386
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:12,446
- Okay.
- Start it.

387
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:13,580
Um...

388
00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:14,898
Oh, boy.

389
00:20:15,918 --> 00:20:16,950
There we go.

390
00:20:16,952 --> 00:20:17,901
Okay.

391
00:20:17,903 --> 00:20:19,503
D for "Drive."

392
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:37,087
Okay. All right.
Okay, uh...

393
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:38,805
Keep going.

394
00:20:40,643 --> 00:20:41,808
That...

395
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,426
Okay, look.
You know what?

396
00:20:43,428 --> 00:20:45,395
- I'm not very good at this.
- No, you're doing just fine.

397
00:20:45,397 --> 00:20:47,030
Okay, try using one foot,
not two,

398
00:20:47,032 --> 00:20:49,650
and, uh, just relax.

399
00:20:49,652 --> 00:20:51,267
Take it smooth.
Don't overthink it.

400
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:52,286
Here we go.

401
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:53,487
Okay.

402
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:59,376
- See? Huh?
- Yeah.

403
00:20:59,378 --> 00:21:00,627
Perfect.

404
00:21:02,214 --> 00:21:04,131
Whoa, whoa. Let's keep it
in between the lines.

405
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:06,449
There we go. That's...
Okay, okay.

406
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:09,086
All right.

407
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:11,305
? Hard life ?

408
00:21:11,307 --> 00:21:14,474
? Don't cry,
would you let it ride? ?

409
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:22,516
? You can see the mornin',
but I can see the light ?

410
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:25,852
? Try, try, try, let it ride ?
What do you think?

411
00:21:25,854 --> 00:21:27,437
It's like I'm you.

412
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:29,106
No, it's not.
? While you've been out runnin' ?

413
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:30,407
? I've been waitin'
half the night ?

414
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:31,908
- Okay.
- Eyes on the road.

415
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:36,146
? Try, try, try, let it ride ?

416
00:21:36,148 --> 00:21:37,611
Feels good, doesn't it?

417
00:21:37,635 --> 00:21:39,450
? And would you cry
if I told you that I lied? ?

418
00:21:39,451 --> 00:21:40,104
Yeah.

419
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:42,328
? And would you say goodbye,
or would you let it ride? ?

420
00:21:44,656 --> 00:21:46,590
Oh, ho, ho.
All right.

421
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:49,426
? And would you cry
if I told you that I lied? ?

422
00:21:49,428 --> 00:21:54,381
? And would you say goodbye,
or would you let it ride? ?

423
00:21:54,383 --> 00:21:56,133
This is the best day ever!

424
00:21:57,269 --> 00:22:01,021
? Try, try, try,
let it ride ?

425
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:03,273
? Would you let it ride? ?

426
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:05,175
? Would you let it ride? ?

427
00:22:05,177 --> 00:22:06,560
? Would you let it ride? ?
You know what? There's nobody around.

428
00:22:06,562 --> 00:22:08,028
Why don't you open it up
a little bit?

429
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,646
? Would you let it ride? ?

430
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,315
Yeah.

431
00:22:12,317 --> 00:22:15,152
- Yeah!
- Huh?!

432
00:22:15,154 --> 00:22:18,354
If this "Sergei" has anything
even remotely useful to offer,

433
00:22:18,356 --> 00:22:19,689
I'll call.

434
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:22,209
Yo, Cass, wait.

435
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:25,412
Are you sure you wanna
handle this alone?

436
00:22:28,884 --> 00:22:30,000
I, uh...

437
00:22:30,002 --> 00:22:32,302
I feel the need
to do something.

438
00:22:32,304 --> 00:22:33,703
And I think Dean's right.

439
00:22:33,705 --> 00:22:36,673
We can't afford to overlook
any possibility.

440
00:22:39,978 --> 00:22:44,731
He seems to be taking this
particularly hard.

441
00:22:48,053 --> 00:22:51,321
Yeah, yeah.

442
00:22:51,323 --> 00:22:52,689
Yeah, he -- he, uh,

443
00:22:52,691 --> 00:22:57,110
was pretty rough on Jack
at the beginning, and...

444
00:22:57,112 --> 00:23:00,396
I don't think
he's forgotten.

445
00:23:00,398 --> 00:23:04,618
And I know
he hasn't forgiven himself.

446
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,205
You know, he's lost people,
we've all lost people,

447
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:09,239
but, um...

448
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:10,841
This feels different.

449
00:23:15,747 --> 00:23:18,748
Losing, um...

450
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,936
a son...

451
00:23:22,938 --> 00:23:24,521
feels different.

452
00:23:49,548 --> 00:23:50,914
I can drive.

453
00:23:53,135 --> 00:23:55,335
Yeah, you can.

454
00:23:55,337 --> 00:23:57,754
No, for real.
I'm a driver.

455
00:23:57,756 --> 00:24:02,476
Yeah, born with
the wheel in your hand, right?

456
00:24:02,478 --> 00:24:04,845
All right, so what do
you want to do next?

457
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:07,130
I know of a bar near here,
little low on class,

458
00:24:07,132 --> 00:24:09,316
but high
on hook-up potential.

459
00:24:09,318 --> 00:24:11,651
Personally, I've never
missed at this place. Hm?

460
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:15,489
Actually,
I've kind of got an idea.

461
00:24:41,884 --> 00:24:43,183
Hey.

462
00:24:43,185 --> 00:24:44,834
Yeah?

463
00:24:44,836 --> 00:24:46,836
Frank Kellogg?

464
00:24:46,838 --> 00:24:48,671
Do I know you?

465
00:24:48,673 --> 00:24:52,342
Um, I just wanted to talk to you
for a couple of minutes

466
00:24:52,344 --> 00:24:54,694
about the night
you came over to my house.

467
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:57,347
Pal,
I been to a lot of houses.

468
00:24:57,349 --> 00:24:59,816
Yeah, but this was
in Pike Creek.

469
00:24:59,818 --> 00:25:04,454
When you were a cop.
Nine years ago.

470
00:25:04,456 --> 00:25:05,906
I don't remember you.

471
00:25:05,908 --> 00:25:08,158
No, I wasn't there.
Um...

472
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,693
My wife and my son
were there.

473
00:25:10,695 --> 00:25:12,412
Alone.

474
00:25:13,415 --> 00:25:15,131
Until you showed up.

475
00:25:22,758 --> 00:25:24,674
So let's talk.

476
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:43,518
Well, bait and beer.

477
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,988
You are a cheap date.

478
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,141
This certainly isn't Tahiti.

479
00:25:49,143 --> 00:25:53,512
You once told me you and your
father did the exact same thing.

480
00:25:53,514 --> 00:25:56,582
It was your happiest memory
of him.

481
00:25:56,584 --> 00:25:58,850
I didn't say <i>that.</i>

482
00:25:58,852 --> 00:26:01,553
It was how you said it.

483
00:26:01,555 --> 00:26:03,388
I could tell.

484
00:26:07,928 --> 00:26:11,463
I guess my point is that...

485
00:26:11,465 --> 00:26:14,833
if I don't make it...

486
00:26:14,835 --> 00:26:19,554
The stuff I'd miss -- it
wouldn't be things like Tahiti.

487
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:22,808
Or the Taj Mahal.

488
00:26:25,446 --> 00:26:28,447
I'd miss more time
with you.

489
00:26:28,449 --> 00:26:34,236
I'm getting that life isn't all
these big, amazing moments.

490
00:26:34,238 --> 00:26:36,571
It's time together
that matters.

491
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,710
Like this.

492
00:26:44,248 --> 00:26:45,631
Well, who'd have thought
hanging out with me

493
00:26:45,633 --> 00:26:47,299
would make you
sentimental?

494
00:26:53,373 --> 00:26:56,141
I've had a good life,
Dean.

495
00:27:14,912 --> 00:27:16,278
Sergei?

496
00:27:22,036 --> 00:27:23,201
Sergei?!

497
00:27:34,098 --> 00:27:36,848
The angel Castiel?

498
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,050
And who else?

499
00:27:38,052 --> 00:27:40,886
Do you see anyone else?

500
00:27:40,888 --> 00:27:43,939
Is the Holy Fire
really necessary?

501
00:27:43,941 --> 00:27:47,726
Self-preservation makes
many things necessary.

502
00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:52,147
Please, sit.

503
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:04,609
As for
my curriculum vitae,

504
00:28:04,611 --> 00:28:06,745
I'm passionately
peripatetic.

505
00:28:06,747 --> 00:28:08,046
No roots.

506
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:11,116
I've re-crossed the globe
many, many times over.

507
00:28:11,118 --> 00:28:14,786
Studying and observing
the skills of myriad witches,

508
00:28:14,788 --> 00:28:17,839
and seers, holy men,
et cetera.

509
00:28:19,843 --> 00:28:23,979
And what is it
exactly you do?

510
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:26,765
Answer
the unanswerable.

511
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:28,016
No.

512
00:28:28,018 --> 00:28:30,268
Know the unknowable.

513
00:28:31,438 --> 00:28:36,191
And I am first and foremost
a healer.

514
00:28:38,328 --> 00:28:40,979
And you know Ketch?

515
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:42,497
We've never met
face-to-face,

516
00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:46,418
but -- our reputations
are mutually stellar.

517
00:28:47,955 --> 00:28:50,539
I wouldn't call Ketch
"stellar."

518
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:53,875
Then you have met him.

519
00:28:58,098 --> 00:28:59,965
But -- back to this nephilim

520
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,183
you've been fostering...

521
00:29:01,185 --> 00:29:02,968
Jack.

522
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,137
His name is Jack.

523
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:09,224
Well, "Jack" is in
a pretty pickle.

524
00:29:09,226 --> 00:29:13,511
If what you're telling me is
right, his condition is dire.

525
00:29:13,513 --> 00:29:17,065
Do you think
it's reversible?

526
00:29:17,067 --> 00:29:20,368
Not as such, but...

527
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:23,622
it can be shocked out
of its progression

528
00:29:23,624 --> 00:29:25,857
by a recharging agent.

529
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:29,911
Think of it like you're,
uh, rebooting a computer.

530
00:29:29,913 --> 00:29:33,131
And where would one find
such a thing?

531
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:37,169
First and foremost,
a healer.

532
00:29:40,424 --> 00:29:43,091
And...

533
00:29:52,552 --> 00:29:54,653
Archangel grace?

534
00:29:54,655 --> 00:29:57,656
Vintage. From Gabriel.

535
00:29:57,658 --> 00:30:01,226
In trade for my home-brewed
cloaking spell.

536
00:30:01,228 --> 00:30:02,994
He used it to hide away
in Monte Carlo.

537
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:05,780
With porn stars,
yes, I know the story.

538
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,885
But this alone
won't do the trick.

539
00:30:11,922 --> 00:30:14,139
It must be administered

540
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:18,760
along with the precise
recitation of a spell.

541
00:30:25,152 --> 00:30:29,053
And what is all this
going to cost?

542
00:30:29,055 --> 00:30:31,606
Don't insult me.

543
00:30:31,608 --> 00:30:32,991
I never take money.

544
00:30:32,993 --> 00:30:35,777
My skills are exclusively
for barter.

545
00:30:36,914 --> 00:30:38,947
Then what is it
that you want?

546
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,284
I don't know.

547
00:30:45,238 --> 00:30:47,739
But...

548
00:30:47,741 --> 00:30:50,759
tell the Winchesters
they owe me.

549
00:30:55,415 --> 00:31:00,101
Well, Frank, how long
you gonna hold out, man?

550
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:03,889
Nick...

551
00:31:03,891 --> 00:31:05,891
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

552
00:31:05,893 --> 00:31:08,276
Really?

553
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:09,778
Okay, um, well,

554
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,231
let me just lay the scenario
out for you one more time.

555
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:15,367
My ex-neighbor, Arty,

556
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:18,269
said he saw someone
coming out of my house

557
00:31:18,271 --> 00:31:20,155
the night of the murder,
right?

558
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:22,073
And then he changed his mind.

559
00:31:22,075 --> 00:31:23,708
I didn't --
I didn't buy it...

560
00:31:24,962 --> 00:31:26,661
...but, uh, he stuck
to story number two

561
00:31:26,663 --> 00:31:28,279
till I came along.

562
00:31:33,837 --> 00:31:36,454
Paid him a visit.

563
00:31:36,456 --> 00:31:39,791
I was very,
very persuasive.

564
00:31:43,146 --> 00:31:45,129
You saw somebody leave
my house, didn't you?

565
00:31:45,131 --> 00:31:47,265
Didn't you?!
It was a cop.

566
00:31:47,267 --> 00:31:51,519
So, Arty said when he
told the cops what he saw,

567
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:53,304
they threatened him.

568
00:31:53,306 --> 00:31:56,074
They said, "Keep
your mouth shut or else."

569
00:31:56,076 --> 00:31:58,276
It was like those, uh --

570
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:01,329
what do you call it --
cover up...

571
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:03,147
like they were protecting
one of their own.

572
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:06,284
What does any of this
have to do with me?

573
00:32:08,255 --> 00:32:11,506
Glad you asked, buddy.

574
00:32:11,508 --> 00:32:15,126
I got in contact

575
00:32:15,128 --> 00:32:17,379
with the reporter,

576
00:32:17,381 --> 00:32:20,331
and she gave me the name
of the beat cop

577
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:21,666
in our neighborhood,
yeah,

578
00:32:21,668 --> 00:32:22,934
a guy she couldn't interview

579
00:32:22,936 --> 00:32:25,220
'cause he left town
after the murders.

580
00:32:28,976 --> 00:32:30,725
See where I'm going
with this?

581
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:37,649
I -- Look, I don't know
what happened that night,

582
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:38,950
I -- I --

583
00:32:38,952 --> 00:32:41,369
Y-Your wife

584
00:32:41,371 --> 00:32:42,937
called the precinct.

585
00:32:42,939 --> 00:32:44,406
Thought she heard
a prowler.

586
00:32:48,228 --> 00:32:49,828
And...?

587
00:32:51,064 --> 00:32:53,498
I'm walking up
the front path,

588
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,083
no back-up,

589
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:57,786
and suddenly from outta nowhere,
there's this guy.

590
00:32:57,788 --> 00:33:00,338
There's this "guy."

591
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,091
He said his name
was "Abraxas."

592
00:33:03,093 --> 00:33:04,592
Abraxas.

593
00:33:04,594 --> 00:33:06,711
The next thing I know,
I'm back in the patrol car,

594
00:33:06,713 --> 00:33:09,764
and I'm --
I'm covered in blood.

595
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:11,850
My wife's blood.

596
00:33:14,554 --> 00:33:18,356
And my baby's blood.

597
00:33:21,645 --> 00:33:23,228
"Abraxas."

598
00:33:25,866 --> 00:33:28,450
I know that name.

599
00:33:29,486 --> 00:33:31,569
Lucifer knew that name.

600
00:33:31,571 --> 00:33:34,956
Now, this -- this is crazy.

601
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:36,741
I was outta my head
that night!

602
00:33:36,743 --> 00:33:39,878
I -- I wouldn't
kill anyone.

603
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,746
I know.

604
00:33:45,635 --> 00:33:48,386
I know.
You were possessed.

605
00:33:48,388 --> 00:33:49,387
What?

606
00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:52,257
You were possessed.

607
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:57,262
Yeah, this -- this --
all this, it's not your fault.

608
00:34:09,693 --> 00:34:13,111
But this was the hand
that murdered my family.

609
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:20,668
And even if it
wasn't <i>you --</i>

610
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,337
it was still <i>you.</i>

611
00:34:24,257 --> 00:34:26,958
I can't let that slide.

612
00:34:27,794 --> 00:34:29,043
No.

613
00:34:29,045 --> 00:34:31,162
No, please.

614
00:34:31,164 --> 00:34:33,598
Please. No.

615
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,599
No.

616
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:35,884
Yeah.

617
00:34:35,886 --> 00:34:37,635
Please.

618
00:34:40,557 --> 00:34:42,807
I'm sorry, Frank.

619
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:44,776
No.

620
00:34:44,778 --> 00:34:46,194
No!

621
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:23,770
This Sergei was legit.

622
00:35:23,772 --> 00:35:27,274
I mean, he was definitely odd,
but he seemed honest.

623
00:35:28,861 --> 00:35:31,644
So, we're still not certain
this is gonna work?

624
00:35:31,646 --> 00:35:34,080
No, we're not certain,
but...

625
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:38,151
Gentlemen?

626
00:35:39,988 --> 00:35:42,088
Are you ready, Jack?

627
00:35:49,464 --> 00:35:52,265
Yes.

628
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:02,809
All right. Here you go.

629
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:14,371
Potione hac,
restitutus Eris.

630
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:17,157
Omnia erunt sicut erant!

631
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:54,110
Something.

632
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:56,029
Something good?

633
00:36:58,233 --> 00:36:59,416
I think so.

634
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:05,872
Definite improvement.

635
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:07,924
- That's great.
- Mm.

636
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:11,461
Yeah.

637
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:14,047
Jack?

638
00:37:14,049 --> 00:37:15,632
Did you say
the words right?

639
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:17,384
I did!

640
00:37:20,222 --> 00:37:21,754
- Jack.
- Jack!

641
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:23,189
Say them again!

642
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:24,975
Of course we followed
the instructions,

643
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:28,278
and Rowena performed the spell
exactly as written,

644
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,263
<i>but he is worse.</i>

645
00:37:30,265 --> 00:37:32,198
<i>He's much worse.</i>

646
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,650
You need to come at once.

647
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:37,487
I am a shaman. I realign
the harmonics of the universe.

648
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,205
I don't make house calls.

649
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:41,658
Jack isn't just
another sick kid.

650
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,495
This is the son of an archangel
of the Lord,

651
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:50,750
who is much more ill now
because of your "harmonics."

652
00:37:50,752 --> 00:37:53,636
And?

653
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:58,141
Science is sometimes
trial and error.

654
00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:01,428
<i>Victory through</i>
<i>experimentation.</i>

655
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:04,814
This was an experiment?

656
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,349
You never said that.

657
00:38:07,402 --> 00:38:12,439
If Jack dies,
I will find you.

658
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:15,492
You can try.

659
00:38:34,046 --> 00:38:37,464
All right...

660
00:38:37,466 --> 00:38:38,998
I'm not very good
at this,

661
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,836
but the priest said
it would help, so, um...

662
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:45,855
I'm gonna try.

663
00:38:48,143 --> 00:38:51,694
I say that I do
the terrible things I do

664
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:55,565
because I couldn't find
who killed Sarah and Teddy.

665
00:38:58,353 --> 00:39:01,404
And that once I did,
I'd be free of this darkness

666
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:03,790
and this rage...

667
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:08,461
...but I lied.

668
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:13,299
Truth is...

669
00:39:17,806 --> 00:39:22,208
...I like
doing these things,

670
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,594
and I don't want to stop.

671
00:39:30,018 --> 00:39:33,686
I'm bonded to you
and what you are.

672
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:35,721
I mean, it's -- it's --

673
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:37,857
It's how you
first found me.

674
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:45,248
I don't know who I am

675
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,866
if I'm not you.

676
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,752
No consequences.

677
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:52,005
No pain. No sorrow.

678
00:39:52,007 --> 00:39:54,424
I want that back.

679
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:57,927
I want it back.

680
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:01,131
I don't want to feel now
what I didn't feel then.

681
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:04,884
Where are you?

682
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:08,354
Where are you?

683
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:12,392
Help me.

684
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:15,195
Help me.

685
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:24,571
I shouldn't have done it.
I shouldn't have taken him out.

686
00:40:24,573 --> 00:40:26,456
It was what he wanted.

687
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:29,609
I mean, we knew he was gonna
get worse, regardless.

688
00:40:29,611 --> 00:40:30,994
Yeah, but it was too risky.

689
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:35,465
Yeah, but, Dean, life,
all of it, is a risk.

690
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:36,833
Jack knew that.

691
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:38,451
Possim rei huius
cognoscere causas...

692
00:40:38,453 --> 00:40:40,887
- And you made him happy.
- Mm.

693
00:40:40,889 --> 00:40:43,389
You did more for him
than any of us.

694
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:55,185
So, what can we do?

695
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,740
Watch over him.

696
00:41:00,742 --> 00:41:03,443
Stay by his side...

697
00:41:03,445 --> 00:41:06,029
as he dies.
