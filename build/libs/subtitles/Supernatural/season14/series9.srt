1
00:00:01,176 --> 00:00:03,011
I know what it's like
to see monsters.

2
00:00:03,012 --> 00:00:05,179
Time to slice and dice.

3
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:06,881
And I know that when
they're gone...

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,383
...they never really go away.

5
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:11,786
Me and my brother?

6
00:00:11,788 --> 00:00:13,554
we're the guys that stop
the monsters.

7
00:00:18,194 --> 00:00:20,828
We're the guys that
scare <i>them.</i>

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,696
Dean!

9
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:26,967
We had a deal!

10
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:28,035
Thanks for the suit.

11
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:29,470
No!

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,840
Do you propose we wage a war
on the humans?

13
00:00:32,842 --> 00:00:35,509
There are ways
to enhance your...talents.

14
00:00:36,212 --> 00:00:38,546
Silver bullets aren't working!

15
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:41,982
Sammy.

16
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,818
When Jack's grace
was taken from him,

17
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,619
his being fell into chaos.

18
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:47,455
The cells
are gobbling each other up.

19
00:00:47,457 --> 00:00:49,290
Jack!

20
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:52,493
Before my life is over,
I want to live it.

21
00:00:52,495 --> 00:00:54,295
And when it's all over...

22
00:00:54,297 --> 00:00:55,529
die.

23
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:57,131
He's gone.

24
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:59,233
Maybe we should start
thinking about next steps.

25
00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:02,670
Wake and a bonfire,
Hunter style.

26
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:08,242
Michael wants the spear

27
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:09,877
because he knows
it can hurt him.

28
00:01:12,548 --> 00:01:13,747
Where is it?!

29
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:14,982
You're no different
than him.

30
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:16,817
I am nothing like him.

31
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:18,552
Get in the damn car!

32
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:25,593
You're the Empty.

33
00:01:27,263 --> 00:01:29,029
I'm taking him.

34
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:30,598
Take me.

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,433
Deal.

36
00:01:32,435 --> 00:01:34,768
When you finally give yourself
permission to be happy,

37
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,837
that's when I'll come.

38
00:01:45,615 --> 00:01:49,083
? Ahhh-ahhh ?

39
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:51,018
? Ahhh-ah ?

40
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:55,456
? Rocking around
the Christmas tree ?

41
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:59,293
? At the Christmas party hop ?

42
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:02,129
? Mistletoe hung
where you can see ?

43
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:06,033
? Ev'ry couple tries to stop ?

44
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:08,903
? Rocking around
the Christmas tree ?

45
00:02:08,905 --> 00:02:12,706
? Let the Christmas spirit
ring ?

46
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,609
? Later we'll have
some pumpkin pie ?

47
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:19,580
? And we'll do some caroling ?

48
00:02:19,582 --> 00:02:21,782
? You will get a sentimental
feeling when you hear ?

49
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:28,155
? Voices singing, "Let's be jolly" ?

50
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:30,057
Oh, my God, no!

51
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:31,725
? "Deck the halls with boughs of holly" ?
Please, no!

52
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:35,963
? Rocking around
the Christmas tree ?

53
00:02:35,965 --> 00:02:40,000
? Have a happy holiday ?

54
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:42,903
? Everyone's dancing
merrily ?

55
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:45,673
? In the new old-fashioned way ?

56
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:04,458
That was the last
of 'em.

57
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,026
Didn't feed, either.

58
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:07,761
Like you said,
about tomorrow?

59
00:03:07,763 --> 00:03:11,165
Keeping my "appetite up."

60
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:12,533
Michael?

61
00:03:17,607 --> 00:03:19,173
Why here?

62
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:21,208
This building, this floor,

63
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,676
cleaning it out

64
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:24,712
and killing everyone?

65
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:27,948
I like the view.

66
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,891
Melanie.

67
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:41,161
These are
the latest volunteers?

68
00:03:41,163 --> 00:03:42,396
Yes, sir --

69
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:43,731
the last ones.

70
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,232
Two wolves.

71
00:03:49,138 --> 00:03:53,907
This one's a bit scrawny
and a bit familiar.

72
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:57,177
I recognize you, Garth.

73
00:03:57,179 --> 00:03:58,679
We've met?

74
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:00,981
'Cause I think
I'd remember that.

75
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:03,083
Oh, I've spent some time
in Dean Winchester's head --

76
00:04:03,085 --> 00:04:05,419
his, um, memories.

77
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:06,887
You were his friend.

78
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:08,355
Still am.

79
00:04:08,357 --> 00:04:09,423
Makes one of us.

80
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:11,358
But I've got
a family now.

81
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,661
And there's a war coming --
your war.

82
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:16,764
And whether I like it or not,
for my family --

83
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:19,033
for my little girl --

84
00:04:19,035 --> 00:04:21,235
I gotta be
on the winning side.

85
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:30,611
- And we're prepared otherwise?
- We are.

86
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:35,683
Tomorrow night, Kansas City
won't know what hit it.

87
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:43,891

89
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:10,784
Don't tell Sam.

90
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:12,352
Jack, it's the middle
of the night.

91
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,288
Ah, I know. I couldn't wait
till breakfast.

92
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,090
Sam says this stuff
will rot your teeth, but...

93
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:19,927
- I like it.
- Jack.

94
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:21,695
If you can't sleep,
that's understandable,

95
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,130
given recent events.

96
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:26,300
You mean dying
and coming back to life.

97
00:05:26,302 --> 00:05:28,435
Yeah, we've all
been through it.

98
00:05:28,437 --> 00:05:31,972
It's something of a rite
of passage around here.

99
00:05:31,974 --> 00:05:33,707
That's not --

100
00:05:35,144 --> 00:05:37,844
I've been thinking
about Heaven.

101
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,117
My mother.

102
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:46,186
You think she's safe?

103
00:05:46,188 --> 00:05:48,055
Yeah, of course.

104
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:51,491
But how could
the Empty get in?

105
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:54,328
And I thought Heaven was
supposed to be perfect.

106
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,197
No. It's not.

107
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,066
Nothing's perfect, Jack.

108
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:02,803
But I know Naomi,
and she's complicated,

109
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:05,472
but there is nothing
that she won't do

110
00:06:05,474 --> 00:06:08,542
to protect the souls
that are in her charge.

111
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:10,777
Try not to worry, okay?

112
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:15,349
- Okay.
- Okay.

113
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:18,685
Cass.

114
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:21,488
The deal you made...

115
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,323
why can't
Sam and Dean know?

116
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:29,429
They can. I...

117
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,831
I just don't...

118
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,767
I don't want them to.

119
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,736
They don't need
that burden.

120
00:06:35,738 --> 00:06:38,271
<i>- You</i> don't need that burden.
- Of course I do.

121
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,273
You did that for me.

122
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:47,614
You know, the Empty said
that it wouldn't come for me

123
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:53,253
until I had finally given myself
permission to be happy,

124
00:06:53,255 --> 00:06:55,622
but with everything
we have going on, with --

125
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,058
with Michael
still out there,

126
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,627
I don't see that happening
anytime soon.

127
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:06,266
This life may be a lot of
things, but it's rarely happy.

128
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,903
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,540
Hey.

130
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:17,411
At least we have
Krunch Cookie Crunch.

131
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:19,312
Yeah.

132
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,748
We do.

133
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,518
Did you take the decoder ring
out of the box?

134
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:29,423
Maybe.

135
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:31,258
The secret password
is...

136
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,393
"Cookietacular."

137
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:34,594
Shh.

138
00:07:43,138 --> 00:07:45,138
<i>Sam, that's not all.</i>

139
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,507
They want me to "make the
change," become one of them.

140
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,243
<i>-When?</i>
-I don't know. Soon, I think.

141
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:53,113
Guess that's what she meant
by "volunteer."

142
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:55,615
Well, did they say
how it works?

143
00:07:55,617 --> 00:07:56,616
Uh, yeah.

144
00:07:56,618 --> 00:07:57,984
Uh, we're supposed to drink

145
00:07:57,986 --> 00:07:59,953
<i>blood mixed with</i>
<i>Michael's grace.</i>

146
00:07:59,955 --> 00:08:02,489
Garth,
y-you can't do that.

147
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:04,624
W-We don't know what
that stuff does, you know?

148
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:05,759
Look, Sam, I knew this
was a risky one.

149
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:07,127
Besides,
I'll just pull the old

150
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:08,428
fake-swallow-
and-spit-it-out-later

151
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,529
cough-syrup trick.

152
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,031
- What?
- Used to work on my mom.

153
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,833
<i>- Garth --</i>
- Well, most of the time.

154
00:08:12,835 --> 00:08:15,469
This isn't your mom, Garth.
This is an archangel.

155
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:16,803
- Hey, dude!
- Oh, got to go.

156
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:17,971
Where'd you go?

157
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:20,640
No, Garth --

158
00:08:20,642 --> 00:08:22,209
Garth?

159
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,344
Hey, buddy.
They're ready for us.

160
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:30,050
Balls.

161
00:08:32,654 --> 00:08:35,388
Garth, huh?
He'll be okay.

162
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,191
He's fooled Michael
this far, right?

163
00:08:38,193 --> 00:08:39,826
Dean, I pulled him
out of retirement

164
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:41,161
for an
undercover mission.

165
00:08:41,163 --> 00:08:42,829
If something happens to him,
it's on me.

166
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:44,965
Okay. Hey, look.

167
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,234
Naomi gave us
Michael's location, okay?

168
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:50,070
We got a spy
on the inside --

169
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,005
for a change,
we're a step ahead.

170
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:53,974
And given everything
we've pulled off lately,

171
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:56,009
I like our odds.

172
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:02,549
It's Ketch.

173
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,421
<i>Mm. Valko's compound</i>
<i>was a breeze,</i>

174
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,090
<i>as it turned out.</i>

175
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:12,692
<i>Jammed the security system</i>
<i>from the outside,</i>

176
00:09:12,694 --> 00:09:16,329
<i>sedated the guard dogs --</i>
<i>Rottweilers, naturally...</i>

177
00:09:16,331 --> 00:09:18,565
- Ketch.
- Hey. You have it?

178
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:20,700
<i>Sam, Dean.</i>

179
00:09:20,702 --> 00:09:23,069
<i>What, no "hellos",</i>
<i>"how are yous"?</i>

180
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:25,071
- No time.
- The egg, Ketch.

181
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:27,607
<i>And as I was</i>
<i>just telling Jack,</i>

182
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:31,178
<i>I did, in fact, manage</i>
<i>to expropriate the egg</i>

183
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,114
<i>from a certain Hungarian</i>
<i>rare-weapons collector.</i>

184
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:37,717
Yeah, uh, uh, Arpad Valko.
W-We got the messages, but so?

185
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:40,120
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>once I got back to Budapest,</i>

186
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,955
<i>where I was intending</i>
<i>to catch the red-eye</i>

187
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,624
<i>back to the good ole</i>
<i>U.S. of A.,</i>

188
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,795
<i>he unleashed a swarm</i>
<i>of mercenaries upon me.</i>

189
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,398
<i>I was cornered,</i>
<i>and so I was forced to,</i>

190
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,732
<i>I'm afraid,</i>

191
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:54,701
<i>drop the egg like...</i>

192
00:09:54,703 --> 00:09:57,904
<i>well, to mix a metaphor,</i>
<i>like a hot potato.</i>

193
00:09:57,906 --> 00:10:00,540
- Oh.
- You dropped it?

194
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:03,543
<i>Never you mind, boys.</i>
<i>I put it somewhere safe.</i>

195
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:07,214
<i>In fact, it should be arriving</i>
<i>in Lebanon, Kansas,</i>

196
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:10,317
<i>the day after tomorrow</i>
<i>between, mm...</i>

197
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,385
<i>2:00 and 6:00 p.m.</i>

198
00:10:12,387 --> 00:10:15,088
You put the only weapon
we have against Michael...

199
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,156
in the mail?

200
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,824
<i>Ah, not just any mail.</i>

201
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,125
<i>I paid extra.</i>

202
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:21,261
<i>Certified Priority Express.</i>

203
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:22,495
He paid extra.

204
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,632
<i>Look, I improvised.</i>

205
00:10:25,634 --> 00:10:27,434
<i>It's not</i>
<i>as if I have access</i>

206
00:10:27,436 --> 00:10:29,436
<i>to the top-shelf clandestine</i>
<i>courier networks I did</i>

207
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:31,671
<i>during my</i>
<i>British Men of Letters days.</i>

208
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:35,275
<i>And really, so,</i>
<i>whose fault is that, hmm?</i>

209
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:39,012
Okay, K-Ketch, we're --
we're not mad,

210
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,681
- W-We appreciate the effort.
- Do we?

211
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,484
It's just that big Michael stuff
is going down soon.

212
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:48,188
We -- We -- We kind of
needed the egg...now.

213
00:10:51,426 --> 00:10:53,493
<i>Oh. Well, um...</i>

214
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,634
<i>Sorry, chaps.</i>

215
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:33,166
Buddy of mine,
he "made the change."

216
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:35,135
Says he's immune
to silver now.

217
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:37,037
- Pretty cool, right?
- Mm.

218
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,479
The only thing that can take him
down now is the Full Ichabod.

219
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:43,209
- Khhht!
- Oh.

220
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:45,078
Says he's never felt
so great.

221
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,480
Called archangel grace,

222
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:51,117
the ultimate powerup --
a real Chug Jug.

223
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:53,920
Dude, "Fortnite."

224
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,855
Oh, yeah.

225
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:06,232
Drink up.

226
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,430
You have nothing to fear.

227
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:39,766
Only about one in seven
volunteers explode

228
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:41,067
when they drink it.

229
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:44,904
Russian roulette odds.
I like it.

230
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,209
Well, <i>sl?inte.</i>

231
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:05,492
All gone?

232
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:19,939
All gone.

233
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,179
She's been seen
taking shelter

234
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,282
at an abandoned recycling
facility outside Omaha.

235
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:30,702
What would you like me
to do?

236
00:13:30,703 --> 00:13:31,507
You feel that, buddy?

237
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:34,121
My pulse is up a bit,
and I'm a bit sweaty.

238
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:37,128
Send a team. Kill her
and destroy the spear.

239
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:38,958
I want it off the board
before tomorrow night.

240
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,461
Damn. I wish we could
sneak off to the gym.

241
00:13:41,463 --> 00:13:43,196
I can feel them
drawing closer...

242
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,365
- Yeah, bro.
- ...each and every monster I've turned...

243
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,467
It's different than when I went wolf.
That was, like, white, hot energy, remember?

244
00:13:47,469 --> 00:13:49,202
...taking their positions
throughout the city...

245
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,171
...waiting for my order.
- This? It's...

246
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:53,206
Oh, boy, I take it back.

247
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:57,010
- This is strong stuff.
- And your order...

248
00:13:57,012 --> 00:13:58,845
what will it be?

249
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:07,687
- Well?
- It's not far.

250
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:10,523
It's being held at a hub
facility in Joplin, Missouri.

251
00:14:10,525 --> 00:14:12,559
Apparently, it would've
made it to Lebanon

252
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:13,960
if it weren't closed
for the holiday.

253
00:14:13,962 --> 00:14:15,795
Well, if they're closed...

254
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:17,063
Means we can get it.

255
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,998
How?

256
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,366
We break in.

257
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,140
Garth.

258
00:14:27,142 --> 00:14:28,308
Hey.

259
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,876
<i>Hey, Sam.</i>

260
00:14:29,878 --> 00:14:31,845
<i>Michael's sending some guys</i>
<i>after...someone.</i>

261
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:34,681
They're headed to an old
recycling plant north of Omaha.

262
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:37,050
<i>Uh, says he wants them</i>
<i>to get a weapon.</i>

263
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:39,419
A spear?

264
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,554
<i>That mean anything to you?</i>

265
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:43,523
Uh, yeah. I have an idea.

266
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,325
But what about you?
How are you?

267
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:46,593
<i>Were you able</i>
<i>to fake 'em out?</i>

268
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:49,028
Oh, yeah. All good.

269
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,597
Uh, but --
But what?

270
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,366
There's more.
I heard Michael's plan.

271
00:14:55,403 --> 00:14:57,737
The whole damn town?

272
00:14:57,739 --> 00:15:00,039
It's gonna be
a bloodbath.

273
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,675
All of Michael's monsters
activating all at once,

274
00:15:02,677 --> 00:15:05,945
attacking, turning everyone
in Kansas City?

275
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,114
It's his army.

276
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,250
And all on a night
when nobody's guard's up --

277
00:15:10,252 --> 00:15:12,352
all nogged up,
waiting for Santa.

278
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:14,621
- Merry freakin' Christmas.
- Yeah, well, Garth said

279
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,356
Michael was gonna give
the signal at midnight,

280
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:17,857
so if we can get to him
before he does...

281
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:19,459
Then we can stop this.

282
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,127
And with the spear
still in play,

283
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,762
that can hurt Michael.

284
00:15:22,764 --> 00:15:24,631
Given as much trouble as he's
gone through to find it,

285
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,432
it might do worse.

286
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:28,601
Could be a shot at actually
killing the son of a bitch.

287
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:30,570
And we may be able
to trap him.

288
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:32,705
I mean, Bobby's been working
on those angel cuffs.

289
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:33,973
They might be able
to hold him.

290
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,441
Yeah, and --
and getting the egg?

291
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:36,776
I mean,
we have Rowena's spell.

292
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:38,378
We can put Michael
back in the Cage.

293
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,979
It's literally a trip
to the post office.

294
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,282
Okay, well, getting the spear
is literally a trip

295
00:15:42,284 --> 00:15:45,385
to the Carter Lake
recycling facilities.

296
00:15:45,387 --> 00:15:46,986
I say we get both.

297
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,655
Me and Cass -- we'll go deal
with Michael's monsters

298
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,923
and get the spear.

299
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:51,257
You and Jack --

300
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:53,126
you do your mail run
and get the egg.

301
00:15:53,128 --> 00:15:56,229
We'll meet back at Hitomi Plaza
with both weapons,

302
00:15:56,231 --> 00:15:57,931
and we'll hit him
from both sides.

303
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,656
You seem good lately.

304
00:16:23,658 --> 00:16:25,358
Happy, even.

305
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,859
You --

306
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,595
We have
a broken tape deck,

307
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:30,463
we drove this whole way
without music,

308
00:16:30,465 --> 00:16:32,966
and you did not complain once.

309
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:35,602
You know, I guess
I'm just fired up.

310
00:16:35,604 --> 00:16:37,303
I mean, look. We got --
We got Jack back.

311
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:38,705
When was
the last time we had

312
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,807
a big, no-strings-attached
win like that?

313
00:16:45,614 --> 00:16:47,513
But now we have Michael.

314
00:16:47,515 --> 00:16:49,949
I know.

315
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:51,351
And, Dean...

316
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:52,952
we're taking a big risk

317
00:16:52,954 --> 00:16:54,621
going after the spear
like this.

318
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:56,155
I know we are.

319
00:16:56,157 --> 00:16:58,891
Listen to me.
Michael conned me.

320
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,728
Kept me trapped and drowning
inside my own body.

321
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,730
Now, when you and Sam
were possessed by Lucifer,

322
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,398
I -- I thought
I understood,

323
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,402
but I didn't,
not really.

324
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,971
So, yeah, if we get
a chance to trap him,

325
00:17:11,973 --> 00:17:13,740
I'll take that,

326
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:16,576
but I won't be truly happy
until he is dead

327
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,778
and <i>I</i> kill him.

328
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:22,515
And now I have
a chance to do that,

329
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:25,685
so, yeah, I'm good.

330
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:27,020
Let's go.

331
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:59,185
All right.

332
00:17:59,187 --> 00:18:01,888
That should take care
of the security system.

333
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,156
May I?

334
00:18:04,726 --> 00:18:07,327
Oh. Sure.

335
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,933
I used to be able to do this
just by touching the handle.

336
00:18:15,403 --> 00:18:17,370
Who taught you
how to pick a lock?

337
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:18,738
I did.

338
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,973
And the Internet.

339
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:24,077
I just...wanted
to stay useful.

340
00:18:31,786 --> 00:18:33,086
Nice work.

341
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,729
I don't think she's here.

342
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,564
Well, she was.

343
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,733
The food's still warm,

344
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:56,269
so either she took a hike
or she's hiding.

345
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:01,674
Dean, where
are Michael's forces?

346
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:04,911
We're going off <i>their</i> Intel,
and they had a head start.

347
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,746
And a shorter drive.

348
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:10,349
Do you think
they already got her?

349
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:13,252
Well, there's no signs
of a struggle.

350
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,921
The Dark Kaia I know?

351
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,323
She wouldn't have gone out
without a fight.

352
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,162
It's lighter
than I expected.

353
00:20:23,164 --> 00:20:24,730
Yeah, it'll do the job.

354
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:26,065
"Happy Holidays."

355
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,916
Sam!

356
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:45,785
Jack!

357
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,689
Jack!

358
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,793
- Jack!
- I wouldn't.

359
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,729
Hey, Sam.

360
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:01,067
Michael.

361
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:04,270
Happy holidays.

362
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,980
How'd you find us?

363
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,483
What are you gonna do,
Sam, hmm?

364
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:23,990
You're gonna kill me,
anyways.

365
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,576
No.

366
00:21:42,578 --> 00:21:44,077
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

367
00:21:58,427 --> 00:22:01,494
Still no answer?

368
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:02,996
No.

369
00:22:02,998 --> 00:22:04,464
I --

370
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:05,599
Sam?

371
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:06,800
It's Garth.

372
00:22:06,802 --> 00:22:08,268
Hey, Garth.

373
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,136
Hey, Dean.
Uh, I tried to call Sam, but --

374
00:22:10,138 --> 00:22:12,038
No answer. Yeah.
Us, too.

375
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,475
Yeah. Um, listen.
Michael left a few minutes ago.

376
00:22:15,477 --> 00:22:17,777
I overheard him say he was going
to back up his forces.

377
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:19,179
Oh, do you mean
the "forces"

378
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:20,447
that are supposed to
be here at Omaha?

379
00:22:20,449 --> 00:22:21,648
Because they
are definitely not.

380
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,016
<i>What?</i>

381
00:22:23,018 --> 00:22:25,051
Dean, I swear.
Michael said --

382
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:28,555
It's okay. Just...call us
if you hear anything, okay?

383
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:30,957
Got it.

384
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,227
Garth.

385
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:35,495
Let's talk.

386
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,234
- So, what, was this a setup?
- I don't know.

387
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:43,870
Well, what do we do? Do we --
Do we go to Hitomi Plaza?

388
00:22:43,872 --> 00:22:46,506
- Do we go t-to Joplin, Missouri?
- Dean!

389
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:54,981
- Why are you here?
- Hey.

390
00:22:54,983 --> 00:22:57,050
What do you want?

391
00:22:57,052 --> 00:22:59,219
Cass. Cass, no.

392
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,390
You know what we want.

393
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:09,396
You think you can
take this from me?

394
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:11,598
You've tried before.

395
00:23:13,235 --> 00:23:17,504
Look, we didn't come
to fight you for it.

396
00:23:17,506 --> 00:23:19,439
I came to ask.

397
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,877
You should know by now
I won't give it up.

398
00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:28,748
Well, then,
you should just kill me.

399
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,857
There are people
that I care about --

400
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:40,460
my family --

401
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,462
and they're in danger.

402
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,731
Michael,
the one who tortured me,

403
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:46,266
the one
who tortured you --

404
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:49,736
he's gonna hurt them
and kill them.

405
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:51,404
And then, worse.

406
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:54,240
<i>Thousands</i> will die.

407
00:23:54,242 --> 00:23:56,443
And the only thing in this world
that will stop him

408
00:23:56,445 --> 00:23:59,112
is the spear
in your hands.

409
00:24:01,383 --> 00:24:04,050
So if you're not gonna
give it to me,

410
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:05,885
kill me.

411
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,700
What'll you do for me?

412
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:23,937
What do you want?

413
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:26,272
I want to go back.

414
00:24:26,274 --> 00:24:28,775
- To the Bad Place?
- I call it home.

415
00:24:28,777 --> 00:24:30,744
But you came to this world
for a reason.

416
00:24:30,746 --> 00:24:34,114
I came here to escape a life
of running from monsters.

417
00:24:34,116 --> 00:24:36,816
But here, it's no different,
not for me.

418
00:24:36,818 --> 00:24:38,785
Michael's monsters
haven't stopped hunting me.

419
00:24:38,787 --> 00:24:41,154
At least over there,
I understood things --

420
00:24:41,156 --> 00:24:43,523
the world, my place in it.

421
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,291
The magic
I used to get here,

422
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:47,594
magic from my home --
it doesn't work here.

423
00:24:47,596 --> 00:24:49,829
To get back, I need help.

424
00:24:49,831 --> 00:24:51,364
We'll do what we can.

425
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,133
The boy.

426
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:55,835
The special boy.

427
00:24:55,837 --> 00:24:58,338
The one that used Kaia
to open up the door?

428
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,874
He can do it again,
for me.

429
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:03,376
Yes, he can.

430
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:07,047
And he will, if...

431
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:09,182
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

432
00:25:12,187 --> 00:25:14,054
You don't.

433
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:16,689
Just like we don't know
<i>you're</i> telling the truth.

434
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:18,992
But we do know that
you are hiding something.

435
00:25:18,994 --> 00:25:21,361
Like Dean said,
you came here for a reason,

436
00:25:21,363 --> 00:25:24,064
but if you're so desperate
to return,

437
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:26,499
you're so driven
that you would consider

438
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:29,669
giving up your spear...

439
00:25:29,671 --> 00:25:32,806
well, that means you have
a new reason,

440
00:25:32,808 --> 00:25:34,407
something you're not
telling us.

441
00:25:36,878 --> 00:25:39,879
You have people you feel
bound to protect,

442
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:41,347
to save.

443
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:45,552
So do I.

444
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,564
If you don't
bring this back to me,

445
00:25:57,566 --> 00:25:59,666
I will find you
and kill you.

446
00:26:09,177 --> 00:26:12,245
- How will we track you down?
- You've done it before.

447
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:14,080
Do it again.

448
00:26:26,228 --> 00:26:27,961
Cass, hey.

449
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:29,429
Sam?

450
00:26:29,431 --> 00:26:32,298
It was Michael.
He knew where we were.

451
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,100
He got the drop on us
and destroyed the egg,

452
00:26:34,102 --> 00:26:36,069
and, uh...

453
00:26:36,071 --> 00:26:37,871
Dean, he's got Jack.

454
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:40,747
- Sam?
<i>- Hey. It was Michael.</i>

455
00:26:41,853 --> 00:26:43,520
<i>He knew where we were.</i>

456
00:26:43,522 --> 00:26:44,654
<i>He got the drop on us</i>
<i>and destroyed the egg,</i>

457
00:26:44,656 --> 00:26:45,688
<i>and, uh...</i>

458
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,257
<i>Dean, he's got Jack.</i>

459
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,859
How did you escape?

460
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:51,528
I didn't.
He knocked me out.

461
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,096
I...

462
00:26:53,098 --> 00:26:54,664
I don't know why
he didn't kill me.

463
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:56,866
- So, what -- is he playing us?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

464
00:26:56,868 --> 00:26:58,802
I mean, Garth's not answering
my phone calls.

465
00:26:58,804 --> 00:27:00,503
Best guess --
Jack's in Kansas City

466
00:27:00,505 --> 00:27:02,005
and that it's still game time
for Michael there.

467
00:27:02,007 --> 00:27:03,807
I -- I'm gonna
head there now.

468
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:06,643
Okay. Hey,
we got the spear,

469
00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:08,711
so we'll meet you there.
- Great.

470
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:10,380
<i>-And, Sam...</i>
-Yeah?

471
00:27:10,382 --> 00:27:12,115
...don't you
go in there alone.

472
00:27:12,117 --> 00:27:13,650
<i>I know.</i>

473
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:15,185
Drive fast.

474
00:27:33,238 --> 00:27:36,372
Why am I here?

475
00:27:36,374 --> 00:27:38,875
Why didn't you
just kill me?

476
00:27:38,877 --> 00:27:42,345
In your present,
powerless condition?

477
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:44,714
Why would I bother?

478
00:27:44,716 --> 00:27:47,383
Are you familiar
with Kansas City --

479
00:27:47,385 --> 00:27:51,054
the people, the terrain?

480
00:27:51,056 --> 00:27:54,991
Back in my world, I enlisted
a garrison to invade it.

481
00:27:54,993 --> 00:27:57,493
We leveled it.

482
00:27:57,495 --> 00:27:59,095
Death from above.

483
00:27:59,097 --> 00:28:02,098
But there was
human resistance.

484
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,766
Things got messy.

485
00:28:03,768 --> 00:28:05,501
I'm trying something
different this time --

486
00:28:05,503 --> 00:28:08,071
an insurgency
from within.

487
00:28:08,073 --> 00:28:10,039
My monster army turning

488
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:12,175
every last
man, woman, and child --

489
00:28:12,177 --> 00:28:14,277
a wave
of transformation.

490
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:16,613
Vampires or werewolves --
it won't matter which.

491
00:28:16,615 --> 00:28:19,349
Everyone they turn
will be mine.

492
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:21,184
No muss, no fuss.

493
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:24,754
Why would you think I want
to hear any of this?

494
00:28:24,756 --> 00:28:26,089
I hate you.

495
00:28:26,091 --> 00:28:28,758
Oh, but, Jack,
we're family.

496
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,293
You know, in fact,

497
00:28:30,295 --> 00:28:34,430
we're the only kin each other
has left in this world.

498
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,400
My uncle's in the Cage.

499
00:28:37,402 --> 00:28:39,969
And you --
you're not family.

500
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:41,905
Well, not literally, no.

501
00:28:41,907 --> 00:28:44,741
Our connection,
our relation

502
00:28:44,743 --> 00:28:46,442
is more a matter
of scale...

503
00:28:46,444 --> 00:28:47,710
of power.

504
00:28:47,712 --> 00:28:49,545
Haven't you learned yet?

505
00:28:49,547 --> 00:28:52,548
In this reality, monsters,
humans, even angels --

506
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,384
they are insects,

507
00:28:54,386 --> 00:28:56,653
atoms compared to us.

508
00:28:56,655 --> 00:28:58,421
But you --

509
00:28:58,423 --> 00:29:01,758
you're just a child,
a mere infant.

510
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,092
For you,
the past two years --

511
00:29:03,094 --> 00:29:04,994
the entirety
of your existence --

512
00:29:04,996 --> 00:29:06,796
feel like eons.

513
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:09,299
You don't even know
what time is.

514
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:14,070
But you will.

515
00:29:14,072 --> 00:29:18,007
Real time, the time
that makes mountains,

516
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:20,310
that wipes out species.

517
00:29:20,312 --> 00:29:23,513
You'll see it all...
with me.

518
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:27,116
No.

519
00:29:27,118 --> 00:29:30,153
Year by year,
century by century,

520
00:29:30,155 --> 00:29:33,156
and as your power
returns and grows,

521
00:29:33,158 --> 00:29:35,458
we'll only become
more alike.

522
00:29:37,662 --> 00:29:39,162
Oh, I know.

523
00:29:39,164 --> 00:29:42,799
Your loyalty to Castiel,
the Winchesters,

524
00:29:42,801 --> 00:29:45,034
the rest of humanity?

525
00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:46,669
It will fade.

526
00:29:48,606 --> 00:29:50,373
And so will the minor
differences --

527
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:52,875
angel armies
versus monster armies,

528
00:29:52,877 --> 00:29:55,378
this Kansas City
or that Kansas City,

529
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,181
one world from another --

530
00:29:58,183 --> 00:29:59,983
they'll fade, too.

531
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:06,756
Sam, Dean, and Castiel.

532
00:30:08,326 --> 00:30:10,326
They'll come for me.

533
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:13,363
Mm.

534
00:30:31,216 --> 00:30:32,682
You have
your coordinates?

535
00:30:32,684 --> 00:30:34,017
Uh, yes, sir.

536
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:35,251
The Cathedral
on Oak Street --

537
00:30:35,253 --> 00:30:37,153
embed myself
in the Christmas mass,

538
00:30:37,155 --> 00:30:38,888
wait for Michael's signal.

539
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,023
All right.

540
00:30:45,196 --> 00:30:47,096
You can go now.

541
00:31:38,483 --> 00:31:40,149
- Jack.
- Sam?

542
00:31:40,151 --> 00:31:41,918
Hey.

543
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,219
Where's Michael?

544
00:31:43,221 --> 00:31:44,720
Ahh. I don't know.

545
00:31:44,722 --> 00:31:46,255
Come on. Let's go.

546
00:31:46,257 --> 00:31:47,790
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

547
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:49,225
Shh, shh.

548
00:31:58,503 --> 00:32:00,002
- Garth.
- Hey.

549
00:32:00,004 --> 00:32:01,771
- You're okay.
- Yeah.

550
00:32:03,174 --> 00:32:05,308
Great.
Let's get out of here.

551
00:32:08,113 --> 00:32:09,579
All right.

552
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:11,414
Dean and Cass
are almost here.

553
00:32:11,416 --> 00:32:13,416
They got the spear.
As soon as they get here,

554
00:32:13,418 --> 00:32:15,651
we regroup, go upstairs...
- Kick Michael's ass.

555
00:32:15,653 --> 00:32:17,286
Yep.

556
00:32:20,325 --> 00:32:21,624
Garth?

557
00:32:28,933 --> 00:32:30,433
Jack!

558
00:32:30,435 --> 00:32:32,668
Oh, Sam. He's in my head.

559
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,036
He won't stop.

560
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:35,972
He won't let me stop.

561
00:32:40,044 --> 00:32:41,944
- Garth.
- I'm sorry.

562
00:32:46,635 --> 00:32:48,068
Hey, don't do this.

563
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,302
You don't
have to do this.

564
00:32:49,304 --> 00:32:50,737
Garth.

565
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:56,777
You can fight this.
You can fight this one.

566
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,913
Ohh!

567
00:33:09,992 --> 00:33:11,391
Sorry, Garth.

568
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:14,094
I'm sorry.

569
00:33:24,106 --> 00:33:25,505
Sleep tight, buddy.

570
00:33:26,975 --> 00:33:29,142
Well, thanks for waiting
for us.

571
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:32,779
I didn't have a choice.

572
00:33:35,617 --> 00:33:37,984
He drank
Michael's grace.

573
00:33:37,986 --> 00:33:39,352
Why didn't he tell me?

574
00:33:39,354 --> 00:33:40,854
I don't know.

575
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:47,661
When Garth turned, I think
it gave Michael a window.

576
00:33:47,663 --> 00:33:49,529
I think that's how Michael
knew where we'd be,

577
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:51,798
how he got the jump
on us.

578
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,467
All right, well,
Garth's on ice now.

579
00:33:53,469 --> 00:33:55,602
You know, maybe if we kill
Michael, it'll cure him.

580
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:56,837
Well, I-I called
the other Hunters.

581
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:57,804
They're on their way.

582
00:33:57,806 --> 00:33:59,539
Take care of the city,

583
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:01,875
in case we don't win
up there.

584
00:34:05,314 --> 00:34:08,181
I wouldn't bet against us,
you know?

585
00:34:08,183 --> 00:34:09,883
Hyah. Hyah.

586
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:11,718
Ah! Whoa. Ah!

587
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,154
I got it. It's cool.
It's good.

588
00:34:16,692 --> 00:34:17,991
How we looking
over there?

589
00:34:17,993 --> 00:34:19,693
Good as new.

590
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:25,966
Jack.

591
00:34:27,503 --> 00:34:31,004
He's up there,
waiting for us.

592
00:34:31,006 --> 00:34:35,342
You know, Michael's monsters
are all over this city.

593
00:34:35,344 --> 00:34:38,078
If he feared us
in the least,

594
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,813
he would've sent
some our way.

595
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:41,014
Yeah, well,
he could've killed me

596
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:42,749
back at
the shipping facility.

597
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:45,519
I think he wanted us to come here.

598
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:47,154
We have to remember --

599
00:34:47,156 --> 00:34:48,889
Michael will sense
my approach.

600
00:34:48,891 --> 00:34:51,391
So zero element
of surprise.

601
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:52,826
Walking right into
a trap.

602
00:34:52,828 --> 00:34:54,728
Which is set
by a full-power archangel.

603
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:58,365
Impossible odds.

604
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:01,401
Feels like home.

605
00:35:03,071 --> 00:35:04,404
Let's do it.

606
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:13,113
? Freude,
schoener Goetterfunken ?

607
00:35:13,115 --> 00:35:16,950
? Tochter aus Elysium ?

608
00:35:16,952 --> 00:35:20,921
? Wir betreten feuertrunken ?

609
00:35:20,923 --> 00:35:25,025
? Himmlische, dein Heiligtum! ?

610
00:35:34,162 --> 00:35:36,362
Come on, fellas.

611
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,100
You're gonna miss the show.

612
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:10,229
Mm.

613
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:15,701
There he is.

614
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:32,718
Castiel.

615
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,456
You do realize
I can feel you in here.

616
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,558
There's really no need
to be...

617
00:36:40,562 --> 00:36:41,761
...coy.

618
00:36:41,763 --> 00:36:43,796
Michael.

619
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,170
Tell me something, Cass.

620
00:36:51,172 --> 00:36:52,572
Why'd you come alone?

621
00:36:52,574 --> 00:36:55,408
Advance scout?
Strongest player first?

622
00:36:59,447 --> 00:37:01,447
Not that strong.

623
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:04,484
But, hey, if they want to miss
all the festivities,

624
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:06,586
well, then that's...

625
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:07,620
...their...

626
00:37:07,622 --> 00:37:08,621
loss.

627
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:12,158
But I got a schedule
to keep.

628
00:37:38,853 --> 00:37:40,553
You got it.

629
00:37:40,555 --> 00:37:42,155
I sure did.

630
00:37:59,374 --> 00:38:01,807
I'm so glad
you could make it tonight.

631
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:04,710
I know you hate me, Dean,
but don't forget --

632
00:38:04,712 --> 00:38:06,312
you let me in.

633
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:10,850
And now
you get to see it --

634
00:38:10,852 --> 00:38:13,686
everything your mistake
will make possible --

635
00:38:13,688 --> 00:38:16,589
all the bloodshed,
all the death --

636
00:38:16,591 --> 00:38:18,391
all on you.

637
00:38:18,393 --> 00:38:20,193
Dean!

638
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,070
Trust me.

639
00:38:31,072 --> 00:38:32,738
That's gonna leave a scar.

640
00:38:40,415 --> 00:38:42,181
Kill him!

641
00:38:51,893 --> 00:38:53,226
Dean?

642
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:06,772
Dean?

643
00:39:26,961 --> 00:39:28,461
No.

644
00:39:28,463 --> 00:39:30,296
Yeah.

645
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:37,970
When I gave up Dean,
you didn't think to question it,

646
00:39:37,972 --> 00:39:40,773
to ask why?

647
00:39:40,775 --> 00:39:43,776
Dean was...

648
00:39:43,778 --> 00:39:46,345
resisting me.

649
00:39:46,347 --> 00:39:49,181
He was
too attached to you,

650
00:39:49,183 --> 00:39:51,984
to all of you.

651
00:39:51,986 --> 00:39:55,621
He wouldn't
stop squirming --

652
00:39:55,623 --> 00:39:58,157
to get out, to get back.

653
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:00,760
So I left...

654
00:40:00,762 --> 00:40:04,530
but not without leaving
the door open...

655
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:05,865
just a crack.

656
00:40:08,636 --> 00:40:10,269
Why wait?

657
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:15,174
To break him, to crush
and disappoint him so completely

658
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:19,478
that, this time, he'll be
nice and quiet for a change --

659
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,480
buried.

660
00:40:21,482 --> 00:40:24,216
And he is.

661
00:40:24,218 --> 00:40:25,551
He's gone.

662
00:40:29,991 --> 00:40:31,824
And now...

663
00:40:31,826 --> 00:40:34,460
I have a whole army
out there,

664
00:40:34,462 --> 00:40:37,496
waiting,
ready for my command,

665
00:40:37,498 --> 00:40:40,733
ready...for this.
