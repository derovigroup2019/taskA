1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,401
Remember when you asked
if we could stop it...

2
00:00:02,677 --> 00:00:04,443
all the evil
in the world...

3
00:00:04,445 --> 00:00:07,079
if we could
really change things.

4
00:00:08,483 --> 00:00:11,217
Maybe we can.

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,451
We're going
to that place,

6
00:00:12,453 --> 00:00:14,620
and we're gonna
save Jack and Mom.

7
00:00:14,622 --> 00:00:16,989
Let's do this.

8
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:18,324
I'm Jack.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,361
? Laid it right on the line ?

10
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:25,598
? When a guy with a chip
on his shoulder said ?

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,301
? “Toss off, buddy,
she's mine” ?

12
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:32,572
? Shot down in flames ?
- You sent me to kill him.

13
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,973
I can hardly
look at the kid!

14
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:35,908
? Shot down in flames ?

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,777
All I see is
everybody we've lost.

16
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:40,112
? Ain't it a shame ?

17
00:00:40,114 --> 00:00:43,115
? Yeah, to be shot
down in flames? ?

18
00:00:46,788 --> 00:00:48,955
I killed my Lucifer.

19
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:51,157
? Shoot me, shoot ?

20
00:01:00,802 --> 00:01:02,802
Gabe! No!

21
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:06,672
? Whoa ?

22
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:07,840
No.

23
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:09,675
I saw how
they do the spell.

24
00:01:15,216 --> 00:01:17,850
We could've been something.
I just need your power.

25
00:01:17,852 --> 00:01:19,385
If we do this,

26
00:01:19,387 --> 00:01:21,120
you're the engine,
but I'm behind the wheel.

27
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,588
It's a one-time deal.

28
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:26,392
? Shot down in flames ?

29
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:27,827
We had a deal!

30
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:29,028
Michael.

31
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,796
Thanks for the suit.

32
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:35,468
? Ain't it a shame ?

33
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,972
? To be shot down in flames? ?

34
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,240
? Shot -- ?

35
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:45,004
Hello, Jamil.

36
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:48,274
Who are you?

37
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:50,976
Oh, we've never met.

38
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:52,945
But you've read
all about me.

39
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:57,016
How does it go?

40
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:13,833
You're...God?

41
00:03:13,835 --> 00:03:16,535
Close, but...

42
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:18,804
not quite.

43
00:03:18,806 --> 00:03:20,005
Gabriel?

44
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:21,874
The other one.

45
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:24,276
The better one.

46
00:03:24,278 --> 00:03:26,545
- Michael.
- There we go.

47
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:29,348
No, no, no, no.

48
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:34,353
Why are you here?

49
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:36,655
Well, that is the question,
isn't it?

50
00:03:38,826 --> 00:03:41,494
Why are we here?

51
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:43,829
I know why I'm here --

52
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:46,198
to ask you a question.

53
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,500
What question?

54
00:03:47,502 --> 00:03:49,435
The same question
I've spent weeks

55
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,803
traveling
around this world

56
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:54,140
asking all sorts
of people --

57
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:56,876
holy men, leaders,

58
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:58,644
killers.

59
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:01,514
And now
I come to you,

60
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:03,048
Jamil Hamed.

61
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:07,920
What do you want?

62
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:11,257
What?

63
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:14,059
Do you want?
Exactly.

64
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:17,563
If you could
have anything,

65
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:19,031
name it.

66
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:24,036
Peace.

67
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:25,638
And love.

68
00:04:28,376 --> 00:04:31,243
If you cared
about peace,

69
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:33,479
you never
would have left Syria.

70
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,747
You never
would have ran

71
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:36,549
and abandoned your friends
to die --

72
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:38,083
and they did die.

73
00:04:38,085 --> 00:04:39,485
No.

74
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,387
And if you
cared about love,

75
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:43,956
you never would have gone into
that broom closet with...

76
00:04:45,092 --> 00:04:46,792
What was her name?

77
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:48,561
No.

78
00:04:48,563 --> 00:04:50,262
Darlene?

79
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,332
Your wife
never would have left,

80
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:57,002
and you wouldn't be
living in this...rat hole.

81
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,239
No!

82
00:05:04,712 --> 00:05:07,279
And that's the problem
with you.

83
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:09,348
You're lost...

84
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,485
...and not worth saving.

85
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:17,389
Wha--Wha--What
do you want?

86
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:21,961
What I have always
wanted...

87
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,633
...a better world.

88
00:05:31,974 --> 00:05:35,974

90
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,819
Hi.

91
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:48,320
You got silver.

92
00:05:48,322 --> 00:05:51,724
Devil's Trap.
Holy Oil.

93
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:55,427
And these here, they're dipped
in Dead Man's Blood.

94
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:56,629
Basically,

95
00:05:56,631 --> 00:05:58,764
you need
some freak dead?

96
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:00,532
I got you.

97
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:06,939
A rawhead
did this?

98
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:09,808
Yeah.
Outside Phoenix.

99
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,810
They're faster
than they look.

100
00:06:19,854 --> 00:06:22,154
Meaner, too.

101
00:06:22,156 --> 00:06:24,223
So, so gross.

102
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:27,927
Soup's on. Who's eating?

103
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,328
- Oh, I am.
- Right here.

104
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,829
Yeah, I'll --

105
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:32,231
Yeah, right here.

106
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,066
- How 'bout you guys?
- I'll have soup.

107
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:38,537
Sam.

108
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:40,539
Hey, Mom.

109
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,574
How was Atlanta?

110
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:45,344
It was, uh --

111
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:47,146
It was a bust.

112
00:06:47,148 --> 00:06:49,081
The woman who claims
she saw an “angel”...

113
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:53,585
...was...

114
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:55,454
Let's just say I think
she had one too many hits

115
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,922
of the brown acid,
you know?

116
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:02,528
Sam, we're gonna
find him.

117
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,229
Ketch is working
that thing in London.

118
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:05,898
Castiel
is in Detroit.

119
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,634
I know it's been
three weeks since Dean...

120
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:15,641
Something will break.

121
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:18,644
It has to.

122
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,715
Yeah. Yeah,
you keep saying that.

123
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:29,922
Have you slept?

124
00:07:29,924 --> 00:07:32,591
At all?

125
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:34,460
Sam, you need to rest.
Go and lay down.

126
00:07:34,462 --> 00:07:36,295
- Mom --
- Chief.

127
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:37,363
Hey.

128
00:07:37,365 --> 00:07:39,598
Good to have
you back.

129
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,900
Thanks.
Don't thank me yet.

130
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:44,837
Word is we got some vamps
heading East on I-90.

131
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,040
Gypsy types.
Pickin' off truckers mostly.

132
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:50,509
Last body got drained and
dropped just outside La Crosse

133
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,745
six hours ago.
Okay. Um...

134
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:54,680
All right.
Get me teams of two.

135
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,482
I want watch points
every 50 miles.

136
00:07:56,484 --> 00:07:59,118
If you see something,
say something.

137
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,353
Maggie, can you hack
the traffic cams on the freeway?

138
00:08:02,423 --> 00:08:04,256
Um...

139
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:05,624
no.

140
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:07,893
Right. Right.

141
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:10,162
Of course. Sorry.
Um, I got it.

142
00:08:10,164 --> 00:08:12,531
Thank you. Uh, please.

143
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,066
Would you call in
Sharon and her crew?

144
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:15,367
We're gonna need
all hands on deck here.

145
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,036
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

146
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:23,475
Sam --

147
00:08:23,477 --> 00:08:25,544
I'm good.

148
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:32,384
I'm good. I am.

149
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,257
Hey, how's Jack?

150
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:47,900
Watch for that left.

151
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,935
I never
had to fight before.

152
00:08:49,937 --> 00:08:52,271
Mm-hmm.
Life's a little different

153
00:08:52,273 --> 00:08:55,040
when you can't just
zap people around, huh?

154
00:08:56,777 --> 00:08:58,811
A lot different.
Yeah.

155
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:01,213
You'll
get used to it.

156
00:09:01,215 --> 00:09:03,415
Truth be told,

157
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,418
this stuff didn't come
all that easy for me, either.

158
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,222
Had my ass handed to me
more times than I can count.

159
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:11,890
But you kept fighting?

160
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:13,492
You got to.

161
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:16,528
As a wise man once said,
“It ain't how hard ya hit.

162
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,498
It's how hard you can get hit
and keep moving forward”.

163
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:24,169
Was that Gandhi?

164
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:26,238
Probably.
Yeah, somethin' like that. Yeah.

165
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,410
So, what are you
gonna do?

166
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:34,213
Watch the left.

167
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:35,814
Attaboy. Attaboy.

168
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:40,886
Ah, that's it.

169
00:09:57,605 --> 00:09:59,438
Castiel, darling.

170
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:03,575
Oh, God.

171
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,213
Sweetie, fix me
a coffee, black,

172
00:10:08,215 --> 00:10:10,249
and a Texas Trinity,
necked,

173
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:12,417
with some bark.

174
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:14,286
Sure.

175
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:17,055
And for my friend...

176
00:10:17,057 --> 00:10:19,224
Water.

177
00:10:19,226 --> 00:10:21,693
- Water.
- All right.

178
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:30,602
What did you
just order?

179
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:31,770
Oh, sausage and brisket,

180
00:10:31,772 --> 00:10:34,306
pork ribs, no sauce,
well done.

181
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:36,808
My apologies for the lingo,
but when in Rome...

182
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:40,012
I was surprised you wanted
to meet here.

183
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,314
I'm surprised you wanted
to meet at all.

184
00:10:42,316 --> 00:10:45,717
Didn't think that you
consorted with...

185
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,886
my kind.

186
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,625
Yes, well...

187
00:10:53,627 --> 00:10:54,993
I need information.

188
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:56,361
Of course, you do.

189
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:58,564
Does any demon

190
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:01,200
know where
Dean Winchester is?

191
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,335
I'm sorry, did you just say that
you lost a Winchester?

192
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:06,672
Because, one --
that's...interesting.

193
00:11:06,674 --> 00:11:08,407
And, two, how is it
that you lost Dean?

194
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:10,209
I thought the two of you
were joined at the...

195
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:13,445
...you know,
everything.

196
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:15,647
Thank you, darling.

197
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,482
Just answer
the question.

198
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:21,019
You see,

199
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:23,789
I could...

200
00:11:27,027 --> 00:11:30,662
...except,
not to be crass,

201
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:33,699
but what's in it
for <i>moi?</i>

202
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:35,300
Your life.

203
00:11:35,302 --> 00:11:37,102
Come again?

204
00:11:37,104 --> 00:11:38,904
I'll speak slower...
Mm.

205
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,640
...and you will tell me
everything you know,

206
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:45,844
or I will burn you
to ash

207
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:48,847
right here
and right now.

208
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:50,882
I think
we can do better.

209
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:54,019
“We”?

210
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,099
We.

211
00:12:45,704 --> 00:12:47,371
You saved me,
Sister.

212
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:49,573
Thank you.
God bless you.

213
00:12:49,575 --> 00:12:51,675
He does,
every day.

214
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,356
Hey, Jo.

215
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:12,898
Who are you?

216
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:14,922
You don't recognize me
with this pretty face?

217
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:17,434
You're not --

218
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:19,102
You're not
Dean Winchester.

219
00:13:19,104 --> 00:13:20,537
You're...

220
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:23,340
Oh, God.

221
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:25,209
People keep
calling me that.

222
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:27,311
Ah, ah.

223
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,916
We need to talk.

224
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:35,752
You're the Archangel Michael,
from another world,

225
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:37,788
and you're possessing
Dean Winchester.

226
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:41,992
Sounds more complicated
than it is.

227
00:13:45,064 --> 00:13:47,497
Why would he
say “yes” to you?

228
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:49,399
Love.

229
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:51,602
Really?

230
00:13:51,604 --> 00:13:54,137
That's very
Hallmark Channel.

231
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,539
So, I'm just
gonna go now.

232
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,307
No, you're not.

233
00:13:59,378 --> 00:14:01,712
Not until I ask you...

234
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,652
...what do you want?

235
00:14:11,857 --> 00:14:13,357
I don't know.

236
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:16,927
Chanel, Dior,
Louis Vuitton.

237
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:19,196
You think
this is a joke?

238
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,300
I don't know
what this is.

239
00:14:23,302 --> 00:14:26,169
You asked,
I answered.

240
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:27,738
We done?

241
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,839
No.

242
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:31,341
I asked,
and you lied.

243
00:14:32,144 --> 00:14:34,678
I didn't.

244
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,114
I know
about you, Jo.

245
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:40,083
Because <i>he</i> knew
about you.

246
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:41,151
You're the rebel,

247
00:14:41,153 --> 00:14:43,353
the angel
who doesn't like

248
00:14:43,355 --> 00:14:46,723
playing by Heaven's rules
or whatever.

249
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:50,060
You pretend to care
about these things --

250
00:14:50,062 --> 00:14:52,029
pretty things.

251
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:55,732
But that's all it is --

252
00:14:55,734 --> 00:14:57,200
pretending.

253
00:14:57,202 --> 00:14:59,770
These trinkets,

254
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:01,638
they don't make you happy.

255
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,874
They just
pass the time.

256
00:15:03,876 --> 00:15:06,376
They're not
what you really want.

257
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:11,548
And if you're so smart,
what do I really want?

258
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,883
Love.

259
00:15:12,885 --> 00:15:16,219
To belong,
to have a place --

260
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:18,755
a home, a family.

261
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:21,191
It's very...

262
00:15:21,193 --> 00:15:24,695
very human of you.

263
00:15:24,697 --> 00:15:26,630
And so...

264
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,233
...so disappointing.

265
00:15:31,904 --> 00:15:36,540
I can sense how many angels
are in this world.

266
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:39,443
There aren't many left.

267
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:41,578
I thought...

268
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,847
maybe I could help.

269
00:15:43,849 --> 00:15:46,049
But if they're all these

270
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:50,988
sad, lost,
fallen things --

271
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,356
things like you --

272
00:15:52,358 --> 00:15:54,758
maybe they're not
worth saving, either.

273
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:05,602
Hey.

274
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:08,672
Hey.

275
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:11,475
I, uh...

276
00:16:13,012 --> 00:16:14,845
...chatted
with Bobby.

277
00:16:21,053 --> 00:16:24,187
He said you may have
had a rough day today.

278
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:26,156
It was fine.

279
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:27,357
Okay.

280
00:16:29,962 --> 00:16:31,395
Jack...

281
00:16:33,132 --> 00:16:36,433
...I know this must be
so hard.

282
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:38,402
Without your grace,

283
00:16:38,404 --> 00:16:40,670
without your powers,

284
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:44,074
it's a lot, I'm sure.

285
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:47,811
But you can get past this.
I know you will.

286
00:16:47,813 --> 00:16:49,846
I have faith
in you, Jack.

287
00:16:49,848 --> 00:16:51,982
And I believe in you.

288
00:16:51,984 --> 00:16:53,717
And --

289
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:56,153
Hey.

290
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:59,189
Sam, um,
he's awake.

291
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:08,398
I have to, uh --

292
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,733
I know.

293
00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:14,471
We'll talk later,
all right?

294
00:17:33,492 --> 00:17:36,326
Did he say anything?

295
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:38,528
I didn't talk
to him.

296
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,997
I can barely
look at him.

297
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:45,035
Thanks.

298
00:18:22,074 --> 00:18:24,274
Oh, hey, Sam.

299
00:18:24,276 --> 00:18:26,343
Hey...

300
00:18:26,345 --> 00:18:27,777
Nick.

301
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:29,679
<i>Nick...</i>

302
00:18:29,681 --> 00:18:31,248
<i>Nick...</i>

303
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:35,185
<i>I'm an angel.</i>

304
00:18:35,187 --> 00:18:36,953
<i>My name is Lucifer.</i>

305
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:40,624
<i>I need to take control</i>
<i>of your mind and your body.</i>

306
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:42,826
<i>Nick, I need you</i>
<i>to say yes.</i>

307
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:44,861
Then yes.

308
00:18:47,432 --> 00:18:50,233
How'd you sleep?

309
00:18:50,235 --> 00:18:52,869
Uh, yeah. Um...

310
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:55,105
Okay. I didn't
wake up screaming,

311
00:18:55,107 --> 00:18:56,606
so that's a plus.

312
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:58,608
Yeah.

313
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,143
So, no more nightmares?

314
00:19:01,313 --> 00:19:03,280
They're getting better.

315
00:19:05,284 --> 00:19:06,950
Good.

316
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:12,656
May I, uh --
May I see it?

317
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:31,308
Oh, look at that.

318
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,642
Looks like
it's healing.

319
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:36,813
Yeah, it itches a lot.
Doesn't really, uh,

320
00:19:36,815 --> 00:19:39,082
hurt! Aah!

321
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:40,116
Sorry.

322
00:19:40,118 --> 00:19:43,353
Ow.

323
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:47,757
Ow.

324
00:19:50,462 --> 00:19:52,796
I don't get it.

325
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:54,998
I don't understand
how Lucifer could die

326
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,566
and I could live.

327
00:19:56,568 --> 00:19:58,368
Yeah, um...

328
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,504
I think that maybe it's
because the archangel blades

329
00:20:01,506 --> 00:20:03,573
were made to kill
the archangel inside

330
00:20:03,575 --> 00:20:05,508
a-and not the person
they, uh --

331
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,845
Possesses and uses to almost
end the world twice?

332
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:11,681
Yeah. That.

333
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:16,886
It must be weird, you looking
at me and seeing him.

334
00:20:18,223 --> 00:20:20,857
Yeah.

335
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:23,093
But...

336
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:25,762
I'm really glad
it's you.

337
00:20:25,764 --> 00:20:27,731
I'm glad
Lucifer is dead.

338
00:20:29,568 --> 00:20:31,234
Me, too.

339
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:34,704
You still, uh --

340
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:36,539
Y-You still remember --

341
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,843
Oh, I mean, just little bits
and pieces here and there.

342
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:43,046
Nothing -- Nothing
about your brother.

343
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:44,481
Okay.

344
00:20:46,218 --> 00:20:48,118
And, uh, Michael?

345
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,688
Did he tell Lucifer
anything?

346
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,291
Anything
about his plan?

347
00:20:55,694 --> 00:20:59,062
I mean,
I remember him saying

348
00:20:59,064 --> 00:21:02,899
he wanted to do it right
this time.

349
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:18,081
- Hey, Cass.
<i>- Hello, Sam.</i>

350
00:21:19,951 --> 00:21:21,318
<i>Who is this?</i>

351
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,552
Oh.

352
00:21:22,554 --> 00:21:25,989
I'm the boy
who's got your angel.

353
00:21:28,327 --> 00:21:29,592
And if you want
to see him again,

354
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:32,395
you know, alive,

355
00:21:32,397 --> 00:21:34,297
we should
probably chat.

356
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:46,487
It's a trap.

357
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:48,823
Yep.

358
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:52,726
- This guy's a --
- Demon.

359
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,262
He just told you
he was a demon?

360
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:57,832
Yeah.

361
00:21:57,834 --> 00:21:59,600
He seemed pretty proud
of it, too.

362
00:21:59,602 --> 00:22:02,470
Yeah, they ain't
a real humble bunch.

363
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:04,472
So, what do we do?

364
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:10,277
We get Cass back.

365
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:15,883
All right, grab holy water,
Devil's Trap bullets,

366
00:22:15,885 --> 00:22:18,319
angel blades, because whatever
we're walking into --

367
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:20,154
It's gonna suck.

368
00:22:20,156 --> 00:22:21,655
Exactly.

369
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,408
Maggie,
you're with Bobby.

370
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,876
Mom, you're with me.

371
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,714
I'm coming, too.

372
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,785
I know I'm not as strong
as I used to be,

373
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,754
but I can help.

374
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:44,427
I have to.

375
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,695
Listen, kid --

376
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,096
Okay.

377
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,632
Grab your gear.

378
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,171
Sam, I mean --

379
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,906
Jack's a worker,
but he ain't ready

380
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,975
for a full-on
demon smackdown.

381
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,610
So...

382
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,178
we keep
an eye on him.

383
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,217
He needs this, Bobby.

384
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:18,928
And <i>danke,</i>
sweetie.

385
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,498
Castiel, you sure I can't
get you anything hot

386
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,834
and black?

387
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,069
Coffee has
no effect on me.

388
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:28,905
Hm.

389
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,573
Me either.

390
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,744
You know,
not anymore,

391
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,814
but it's like
saltwater taffy

392
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,849
or infants -- you know,
I just like the taste.

393
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,617
Why are you
doing this?

394
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:43,452
I'm just trying
to be a good host

395
00:23:43,454 --> 00:23:44,620
like Mother
would have wanted.

396
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:46,489
No, w--

397
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,726
Why are you using me as bait?

398
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:57,400
I mean, it's kind of what
you're <i>for,</i> isn't it?

399
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,208
And I need something

400
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,310
from Sam Winchester.

401
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,881
You really think that he's
gonna make a deal with you?

402
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,749
Oh, he's dealt with worse.

403
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:19,255
You see, recently,
I had a revelation.

404
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:27,496
You know, somebody asked me
what it was

405
00:24:27,498 --> 00:24:29,332
as a demon
walking the planet,

406
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,234
destroying,
drinking, defiling --

407
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:34,937
you know,
the Three D's --

408
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:36,606
I didn't know.

409
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:41,110
So, I sat back,
and I gave it a good think,

410
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:45,648
and I realized
exactly what I wanted.

411
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:52,021
And what is it?

412
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,956
Everything.

413
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,404
Sam, it's gonna be fine.

414
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:12,642
Stop saying that,
please.

415
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,944
What?

416
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,680
“It's gonna be fine,” that
everything's gonna be fine,

417
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,615
we're gonna
find Dean, and --

418
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:21,584
We are.
You don't know that.

419
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,957
Dean's gone, and we have
no idea where he is

420
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:31,460
or -- or if he's
even still alive.

421
00:25:31,462 --> 00:25:33,496
You know,
Michael could have...

422
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:36,666
burned him out
or worse, and...

423
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,771
I know.

424
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,608
I know he's out there,

425
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,476
scared and alone.

426
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,314
I know.

427
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,850
I know he might
never come back.

428
00:25:57,388 --> 00:26:00,456
Never think
I don't know that.

429
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,658
But I can't...

430
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:07,396
I have to think
about the good, Sam,

431
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:10,199
because, if I don't,
I will drown in the bad.

432
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,302
For Dean's sake,

433
00:26:13,304 --> 00:26:14,971
I can't do that.

434
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:19,875
We can't do that.

435
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:35,224
Listen, Jack.
On the other side,

436
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:38,627
you saved me and mine
a dozen times.

437
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:40,463
Now, things
may have changed,

438
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,465
but whatever happened --

439
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,001
whatever <i>happens --</i>

440
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,836
we got your back.

441
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:22,438
Here.

442
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,907
The Demon Killing Knife.

443
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,942
Are you sure?

444
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:29,111
Yeah.
They'll search me.

445
00:27:29,113 --> 00:27:31,047
It's safer with you.

446
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,182
All right.

447
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:34,650
You know what to do.

448
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,172
Ladies and gentlemen,

449
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,875
the great
Sam Winchester.

450
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:14,723
I have heard
so much about you.

451
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:17,126
You are
a damn legend, Sam --

452
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,694
a-an icon.

453
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,097
Th-The shoulders,
the -- the hair.

454
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:24,100
Mm-mm!

455
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,502
You are my Beyonc?.

456
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,771
Cass, you okay?

457
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,206
Of course he is.

458
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,808
I don't damage
the merchandise.

459
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:37,947
I'm more embarrassed
than I am hurt.

460
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,482
And you are?

461
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,883
Kipling.

462
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,652
Uh, “Kip” for short.

463
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,056
Cool. Kip.

464
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,159
I'm here
like you asked, so...

465
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:53,062
Yeah, you're here,
but not exactly as I asked.

466
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:57,032
You see, I told you
to come alone.

467
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:58,434
But...

468
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,371
Found them outside.

469
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:05,107
They didn't even
put up a fight.

470
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:06,942
I'm sorry, Sam.

471
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:16,519
It's fine. You tried.

472
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:19,021
But I'm gonna need
a little bit more now,

473
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,623
you know, not to...

474
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,892
eat them.

475
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,994
I-It's just, you know,
late capitalism.

476
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:26,462
You understand.

477
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:31,000
So, Sam,

478
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,334
let's make a deal.

479
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:40,184
You're looking
to make a deal?

480
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:43,253
I'm a demon.
That's how we do.

481
00:29:47,693 --> 00:29:49,226
Please.

482
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,166
Sit.

483
00:29:58,471 --> 00:30:00,504
No?

484
00:30:00,506 --> 00:30:03,807
Suit yourself,
barbarian.

485
00:30:04,644 --> 00:30:06,310
What do you want?

486
00:30:06,312 --> 00:30:08,846
That is a very good question.
What do I want?

487
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:12,149
You know, I don't know if
you're aware or not, Sam,

488
00:30:12,151 --> 00:30:14,852
but Hell's in a bit
of a pickle,

489
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,621
you know, with Crowley dead
and Asmodeus Kentucky fried,

490
00:30:17,623 --> 00:30:18,922
which means --
- I don't care.

491
00:30:18,924 --> 00:30:20,524
Yes, you do.

492
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:25,229
Or you will.

493
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:28,599
You see, for the first time
in a very long time,

494
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:30,834
Hell is without a King.

495
00:30:30,836 --> 00:30:33,871
And that --
that's just not right.

496
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,773
- So, I --
- So, you volunteer.

497
00:30:37,643 --> 00:30:39,843
Exactly.

498
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:41,412
Why are you
telling me all this?

499
00:30:41,414 --> 00:30:45,149
Because I want to work
with you, Sam,

500
00:30:45,151 --> 00:30:46,950
not against you.

501
00:30:46,952 --> 00:30:48,719
And is that why
you took me hostage?

502
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,388
It's exactly why
you're still breathing.

503
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,191
It gives me a chance to show
Sam and friends

504
00:30:54,193 --> 00:30:56,560
that I can hurt them...

505
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,596
...but choose not to.

506
00:30:59,598 --> 00:31:02,566
You see, I want
the Crowley Deal.

507
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:04,101
I give you
information,

508
00:31:04,103 --> 00:31:06,570
a spot of help
every now and again,

509
00:31:06,572 --> 00:31:10,407
and in return, you choose
to turn a blind eye

510
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:11,642
to the crossroads deals,

511
00:31:11,644 --> 00:31:14,645
the demon-on-demon violence,
et cetera.

512
00:31:14,647 --> 00:31:16,647
We never gave Crowley
that deal.

513
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:18,015
How exciting.

514
00:31:18,017 --> 00:31:20,884
Then I would be
breaking new ground.

515
00:31:20,886 --> 00:31:22,319
All right.

516
00:31:22,321 --> 00:31:25,255
You got some good lines,
I'll give you that much,

517
00:31:25,257 --> 00:31:27,091
but you're no Crowley.

518
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,526
I know that.
And so do they.

519
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,300
Ouch!

520
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,837
Owie!

521
00:31:41,307 --> 00:31:44,641
I know
that I'm not that

522
00:31:44,643 --> 00:31:47,745
ponce-y
son of a bitch.

523
00:31:47,747 --> 00:31:50,013
You see, in life,

524
00:31:50,015 --> 00:31:53,283
I rode with Genghis Khan,
and I burned half the world.

525
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:55,052
So, <i>please,</i>

526
00:31:55,054 --> 00:31:59,857
do you think that I like
prancing around like this?

527
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:01,425
Please.

528
00:32:01,427 --> 00:32:02,793
If I had it my way,

529
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:06,063
I would eat
your heart.

530
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:16,473
But a King
has an image to maintain.

531
00:32:16,475 --> 00:32:18,742
And I'm not
afraid of you.

532
00:32:20,446 --> 00:32:22,079
But...

533
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:23,714
they are.

534
00:32:26,018 --> 00:32:27,885
So, take
the deal, Sam,

535
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:32,156
before I stop
trying to be Crowley

536
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,825
and I show you
who I really am.

537
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,830
So, what do you say,
darling?

538
00:32:49,141 --> 00:32:50,841
No.

539
00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:56,480
A-Are you sure,
because I know things --

540
00:32:56,482 --> 00:32:59,950
a-all sorts of things.
- Yeah.

541
00:33:01,053 --> 00:33:02,753
So do I.

542
00:33:03,255 --> 00:33:04,755
Like?

543
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:31,882
Sam!

544
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:39,323
How smart.

545
00:34:01,013 --> 00:34:03,780
Hey. Stay low.

546
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:13,957
Hey!

547
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,792
Get away from him.

548
00:34:17,029 --> 00:34:18,829
Aw, balls.

549
00:34:28,173 --> 00:34:30,107
Take this.
You know how to use it?

550
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,309
Uh, stab them
with the pointy end?

551
00:34:32,311 --> 00:34:34,211
- Pretty much. Okay.
- Okay.

552
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:30,400
Cool.

553
00:35:40,646 --> 00:35:42,245
Enough!

554
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,151
There will be
no new King of Hell.

555
00:35:52,157 --> 00:35:54,658
Not today.

556
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,027
Not ever.

557
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:02,966
And if anybody
wants the job,

558
00:36:02,968 --> 00:36:05,936
you can come through me.

559
00:36:05,938 --> 00:36:08,772
Understood?

560
00:36:08,774 --> 00:36:10,507
So, what's it gonna be?

561
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:35,766
That's what I thought.

562
00:36:37,926 --> 00:36:40,461
Yeah.

563
00:36:40,463 --> 00:36:43,330
Yeah, yeah. I --
No, I don't care. I --

564
00:36:43,332 --> 00:36:45,165
Just keep looking.

565
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:47,334
Yeah. Thanks.

566
00:36:47,336 --> 00:36:49,937
Who was that?

567
00:36:49,939 --> 00:36:52,406
Uh, Ketch.

568
00:36:53,943 --> 00:36:55,543
He's in London

569
00:36:55,545 --> 00:37:00,314
searching for the Newton-Dee
Hyperbolic Pulse Generator.

570
00:37:00,316 --> 00:37:02,016
The what?

571
00:37:02,018 --> 00:37:03,517
It's the --
It's the magic egg

572
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:05,085
that kicked Lucifer
out of the President.

573
00:37:05,087 --> 00:37:07,054
I thought we could use it
on Michael, but

574
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:08,522
Ketch can't find it.

575
00:37:08,524 --> 00:37:11,392
So, that's another dead end,
which is just awesome.

576
00:37:15,731 --> 00:37:18,198
Sam, are you all right?

577
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,601
Yeah,
I've been better.

578
00:37:20,603 --> 00:37:23,404
I've been worse.

579
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:25,205
You?

580
00:37:26,842 --> 00:37:28,208
I'm -- I'm just sorry.

581
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,277
I should never have gone
to those demons.

582
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:31,345
Cass, I --

583
00:37:31,347 --> 00:37:33,714
No, I-I-I don't blame you.
I...

584
00:37:36,285 --> 00:37:38,052
Honestly, I-I

585
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:40,454
wish I'd have thought
of it first.

586
00:37:40,456 --> 00:37:43,257
If it meant
finding Dean, I-I'd...

587
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:45,159
work with...

588
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:49,697
I'd do anything.

589
00:37:56,973 --> 00:37:58,706
Not bad today, old man.

590
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:00,140
You, too, sunshine.

591
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:11,952
- Hey, Jack.
- I'm fine.

592
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,827
You did well.

593
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:22,630
All I did
was get punched...

594
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:24,498
in the face.

595
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,468
Well, to be fair, we all
got punched in the face.

596
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,437
That's not -- Before,
when I had my powers,

597
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:32,473
I-I could
have done something, and --

598
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:34,742
Jack.

599
00:38:34,744 --> 00:38:37,678
You don't -- You --
You don't have your powers.

600
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,347
And you --

601
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:42,950
Your grace should
regenerate in time,

602
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:44,151
but until then --

603
00:38:44,153 --> 00:38:46,720
I'm useless.

604
00:38:46,722 --> 00:38:49,356
I can't kill demons,
I can't find Dean,

605
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:51,225
and Michael
is in our world,

606
00:38:51,227 --> 00:38:52,860
and I can't stop him.

607
00:38:53,996 --> 00:38:56,530
I can't do anything.

608
00:38:56,532 --> 00:39:00,467
I don't have anything.

609
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:04,271
Oh, Jack,

610
00:39:04,273 --> 00:39:06,206
that's just not true.

611
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,778
You've got me.

612
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,680
You have all of us.

613
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,584
You have your family.

614
00:39:23,426 --> 00:39:27,294
And -- And we are
going to find Dean

615
00:39:27,296 --> 00:39:28,762
and we are going
to beat Michael

616
00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:30,664
and we're going
to do it together.

617
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:32,399
We --

618
00:39:34,603 --> 00:39:36,303
Because
that's what we do.

619
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,409
Hello?

620
00:40:15,411 --> 00:40:17,444
<i>Sam?</i>

621
00:40:17,446 --> 00:40:18,846
Jo?

622
00:40:20,149 --> 00:40:21,882
Yeah.

623
00:40:21,884 --> 00:40:23,016
We have a problem.

624
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:30,624
Now, you --

625
00:40:30,626 --> 00:40:33,761
you know
exactly what you want.

626
00:40:36,031 --> 00:40:39,399
You don't pretend
to want to help people...

627
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:42,202
or save the world.

628
00:40:42,204 --> 00:40:46,106
Your want
is pure and simple...

629
00:40:46,108 --> 00:40:48,542
and clean.

630
00:40:48,544 --> 00:40:51,378
And that's why you
are worth saving.

631
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,149
That's why we are going
to work so well together.

632
00:40:56,452 --> 00:40:59,153
Because you --

633
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:01,021
you just want to eat.
