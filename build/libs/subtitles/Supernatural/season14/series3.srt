1
00:00:00,315 --> 00:00:02,249
Let's move.

2
00:00:02,251 --> 00:00:03,517
I know this must be
so hard.

3
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:04,885
Without your grace,

4
00:00:04,887 --> 00:00:06,453
without your powers.

5
00:00:06,455 --> 00:00:09,590
I can't kill demons.
I can't find Dean and Michael.

6
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,191
I'm useless.

7
00:00:11,193 --> 00:00:13,394
Cops just turned up
a pile of corpses in Duluth,

8
00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:14,562
and their eyes
were burnt out.

9
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:15,863
So Michael?

10
00:00:15,865 --> 00:00:17,531
It was like
he was experimenting.

11
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:19,433
Experimenting?
What for?

12
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:21,802
There are ways
to enhance your talents.

13
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:23,270
Nothing's working!

14
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:25,372
Do you propose we wage a war
on the humans?

15
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:27,241
This isn't just Michael
we're talking about.

16
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:28,475
It's Dean.

17
00:00:29,478 --> 00:00:30,611
Sammy.

18
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,446
It's me.

19
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:39,119
It's just every time
I think about it, you know,

20
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:40,387
it's like a --
it's like a nightmare.

21
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:42,456
I mean, I can't eat.
I can't sleep.

22
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:43,991
It's always just there,
watching.

23
00:00:43,993 --> 00:00:45,793
Dean, it's just a beard.

24
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,328
I've been a little busy
lately.

25
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,229
Yeah, well,
that's not an excuse.

26
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:50,898
You know, 'cause, uh,
"Duck Dynasty" called,

27
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,934
and they just --
they want it all back.

28
00:00:53,936 --> 00:00:55,269
Some people say
I look good.

29
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:58,672
No. No, Sam.
No people say that.

30
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:01,308
Hey, hey.

31
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,576
You, uh --

32
00:01:02,578 --> 00:01:04,511
Hey, if you're gonna
ask if I'm okay,

33
00:01:04,513 --> 00:01:06,680
you don't have to.

34
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:08,649
All right.

35
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,250
It's just, uh,
you know,

36
00:01:10,252 --> 00:01:13,120
you didn't talk a whole lot
on the ride here.

37
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:15,255
Look, Michael bailed,
all right?

38
00:01:15,257 --> 00:01:16,423
I don't know how.

39
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:17,524
I don't know why.

40
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:19,026
He just --

41
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:21,261
He just cleared out.

42
00:01:21,263 --> 00:01:22,963
And as far
as my memory goes,

43
00:01:22,965 --> 00:01:24,698
I mean, everything
from the second I said yes

44
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,501
to the moment I walked
through those doors is blank,

45
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:29,670
so I'm good.

46
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:32,206
I'm just really, really happy
to be...

47
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:35,643
...home.

48
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,884
Yeah, there have been
a few changes made.

49
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:46,353
So, uh...

50
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:53,794
Yeah.
Not Michael anymore.

51
00:01:53,796 --> 00:01:55,796
Right.

52
00:01:55,798 --> 00:01:57,364
Chief told us.

53
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:58,832
Welcome back.

54
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:02,536
"Chief"?

55
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:04,738
Yeah, I-I asked them not
to call me that, but --

56
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,939
Dean?

57
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:11,011
Hey, kid.

58
00:02:11,013 --> 00:02:14,381
Is it really you?

59
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:15,249
Yeah.

60
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:29,663
Dean.

61
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:32,166
Cass.

62
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:33,934
Sorry,
I wanted to be there,

63
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:36,503
but we figured that Michael
would sense my presence, so --

64
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:38,539
Sam told me.

65
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,874
Ain't no thing.

66
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:42,676
Where's Mary?

67
00:02:42,678 --> 00:02:44,178
She and Bobby
stayed back in Duluth

68
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,782
to clean up the, uh --
uh, the situation.

69
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:52,352
Yeah, well,
speaking of cleanup,

70
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:56,256
I, uh...
I need a shower.

71
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:58,192
Mm.

72
00:02:58,194 --> 00:03:00,027
Hey, y-y-you --

73
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:01,261
Still okay.

74
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:03,130
I promise.

75
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:11,371
Uh, how's Nick?

76
00:03:11,373 --> 00:03:12,706
He's...

77
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,807
He's gone.

78
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:14,908
What?

79
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,243
Nick just --

80
00:03:16,245 --> 00:03:17,778
He left a note,
said that he had

81
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,613
some personal business
to attend to,

82
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:23,584
and he hasn't -- he hasn't been
returning my calls.

83
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:25,252
He was
in a dark place.

84
00:03:25,254 --> 00:03:27,287
Maybe he just
needed some time.

85
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:28,789
All right.
Yeah. Maybe.

86
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,824
Sam...

87
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:33,026
Dean --
how is he really?

88
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:37,965
I don't know.

89
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:51,478
Why would Michael just...
give up his vessel like that?

90
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,181
I don't know.

91
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,619
And why was...

92
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:02,623
Why was Michael
helping monsters?

93
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,858
Cass...

94
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,928
truth is...

95
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,197
we don't know anything.

Yeah, I don't know
how I got it.

99
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:35,856
Well, what could hurt Michael
like that?

100
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,725
Whatever it was
must've been strong.

101
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:41,195
Right. So, Cass,
I'm gonna need you

102
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,896
to, uh, get in my head.

103
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:45,499
You know, do the whole
Vulcan-mind-meld thing.

104
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:47,067
'Cause if I can't remember
what happened,

105
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:48,468
I need you to drag it
out of me, okay?

106
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,904
W-Wait a second.
You sure about this?

107
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:52,039
Yeah.
I can handle it.

108
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,676
- Dean...
- Cass, come on.

109
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:56,844
Hit me.

110
00:05:12,027 --> 00:05:13,160
Anything?

111
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:35,048
Dean, who was that?

112
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:03,911
Sam, any news?

113
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:07,014
Jody, hey, u-uh...
Yeah, uh, sorry.

114
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:09,082
- Uh...
- Hey, Jody.

115
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:11,418
<i>I'm back.</i>

116
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,920
Hey, Dean.

117
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:15,289
It is so good
to hear your voice.

118
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,224
Yeah, you, too.

119
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:19,660
Um, Jody, that's --
that's the good news.

120
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,395
What's up?

121
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:23,830
Um, you know the thing
that killed Kaia

122
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:25,999
in the Bad Place?

123
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:28,735
- <i>Well, we think it's here.</i>
- What?

124
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:31,004
<i>Yeah, uh, any chance</i>
<i>you've noticed anything</i>

125
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:32,506
rift-related over there?

126
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:35,909
A flare-up or,
um, uh, anything?

127
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:37,911
No, I -- No.

128
00:06:37,913 --> 00:06:39,913
I have video surveillance
going down at the ferry.

129
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:41,648
Claire practically sits Shiva
down there.

130
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,116
There's been nothing.

131
00:06:43,118 --> 00:06:44,985
<i>How do you know?</i>
Well, short version --

132
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,187
when Michael was possessing me,
he got hurt.

133
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:50,791
<i>It left a scar --</i>
<i>uh, two deep gashes.</i>

134
00:06:50,793 --> 00:06:52,659
Stabby, prongy,
kind of like, um --

135
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:55,629
Like someone stabbed you
with a giant meat fork?

136
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:59,833
Yeah. Exactly.

137
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:01,034
<i>How'd you know that?</i>

138
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,551
You're leaving?

139
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:20,821
Kaia's killer
is in Sioux Falls.

140
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:23,824
And he, she, or it
can hurt Michael.

141
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:25,325
We just gotta
figure out how.

142
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:28,562
I'll get my things.
Uh, Jack, um...

143
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:30,330
that might not be
the best idea.

144
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:31,832
Michael's <i>my</i> enemy, too.

145
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:35,035
I fought him for months,
and Kaia --

146
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,703
I'm the one who brought her
into this.

147
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:38,872
I'm responsible
for what happened to her.

148
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:40,073
I want to help.

149
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:41,308
Yeah, well,
not gonna happen.

150
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,976
Because I'm human now?

151
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:44,650
Jack, maybe you just need
a little more --

152
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:45,380
Training?

153
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,713
I've been training
with Bobby.

154
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:47,881
C'mon, kid.
Look at you.

155
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,816
You're barely 100 pounds
soaking wet.

156
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:51,852
You know?

157
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:00,027
Wait. Jack.

158
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:04,031
Hey, I didn't mean...

159
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:06,333
I didn't <i>mean</i>
to be a dick.

160
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:13,106
Little help here!

161
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:19,736
Jules, what's going on?

162
00:08:19,738 --> 00:08:21,872
Case I was working
in Wichita --

163
00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:23,273
the missing teenagers,
dried-up husk bodies?

164
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:24,408
Yeah.

165
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,276
Turns out
it was a witch.

166
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:27,711
She was holding
the girls hostage,

167
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:29,413
and this...

168
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:31,515
is the only
survivor.

169
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:32,749
Took Broom-Hilda down
with that

170
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:34,184
witch-killing bullet
you gave me,

171
00:08:34,186 --> 00:08:36,553
but soon as I did,
something went wrong.

172
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:38,889
Didn't even have time
to bury the body before --

173
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:41,758
Before what?

174
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,428
Lora, darling,
show them.

175
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:53,737
The witch
must've hexed her.

176
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:58,542
Looks like an aging spell.
Can you fix it?

177
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:00,777
I think so.

178
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:11,955
Cass?

179
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:13,590
Uh, this might
take a while.

180
00:09:13,592 --> 00:09:15,225
You two, go.

181
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:17,127
Get to Sioux Falls before
the trail goes cold,

182
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:18,629
and I'll catch up when I'm done.
- No, no, I don't know.

183
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:20,330
Yeah, no, Cass is --
Cass is right.

184
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:21,665
He can handle this.

185
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,267
We need to hit the road.

186
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:26,737
Let's go.

187
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:27,307
Sam.

188
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:29,331
All right.
All right, yep.

189
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:31,875
Good work.

190
00:09:42,988 --> 00:09:44,421
You're in a hurry.

191
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:45,756
Shouldn't I be?

192
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:47,524
If you're worried
about that girl,

193
00:09:47,526 --> 00:09:50,961
- Cass has got it handled.
- Yeah, I know.

194
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:52,863
Well, then,
what's the problem?

195
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:57,801
Dean, we still have no idea
why Michael let you go

196
00:09:57,803 --> 00:09:59,870
or where he is now
or what he wants.

197
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:01,638
Yeah, or who his favorite
Spice Girl is.

198
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,173
Come on, man.
This isn't a joke.

199
00:10:03,175 --> 00:10:04,675
Something huge happened,

200
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:06,843
and you won't
really even talk about it.

201
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:09,946
But this whole Michael thing,
we need to deal with it.

202
00:10:09,948 --> 00:10:12,816
Okay, I'm literally going 80
to deal with it.

203
00:10:12,818 --> 00:10:14,051
How can I be running
from something

204
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:16,019
when I'm racing
towards it?

205
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:17,054
I don't know.

206
00:10:17,056 --> 00:10:18,522
- Kind of your thing.
- Okay.

207
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:20,957
Okay, look,
I'm just saying...

208
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,694
You said you let Michael in,
then, bang,

209
00:10:23,696 --> 00:10:24,961
you're back in a blink.

210
00:10:24,963 --> 00:10:29,132
But for me...
you were gone for weeks.

211
00:10:29,134 --> 00:10:32,035
I didn't know if you were alive.
I...

212
00:10:35,908 --> 00:10:38,208
I just need you
to talk to me,

213
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,976
to slow down

214
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:42,813
so I can catch up.

215
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:52,556
Call Jody.
Let her know we're almost there.

216
00:11:08,073 --> 00:11:09,539
Dean.

217
00:11:11,276 --> 00:11:12,442
Oh, welcome home.

218
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:13,443
Thanks.

219
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:14,778
How'd you do it?

220
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,380
What, me versus some
assbag archangel --

221
00:11:16,382 --> 00:11:18,882
who would you take?
- You, every time.

222
00:11:18,884 --> 00:11:21,218
Hi.

223
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,520
Hey, I like it!

224
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:26,256
Uh, i-it's, uh...

225
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,626
How are you?
How are the girls?

226
00:11:29,628 --> 00:11:31,428
Surprisingly good.

227
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,730
Alex is still at the hospital.
Patience is still in school.

228
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:36,233
Claire's still...
Claire.

229
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:38,268
I, uh...

230
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,438
I haven't been home
since I talked to you.

231
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,106
I may be avoiding her.

232
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:44,908
It's just, before I tell her
what's going on,

233
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,143
I need to --

234
00:11:46,145 --> 00:11:47,778
You need to know
what's going on.

235
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,780
Yeah. That's it.
Yeah.

236
00:11:49,782 --> 00:11:52,249
Okay, so here are

237
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:54,484
the locations
of the three bodies we found --

238
00:11:54,486 --> 00:11:55,552
headless, by the way.

239
00:11:55,554 --> 00:11:56,720
Human?

240
00:11:56,722 --> 00:11:57,888
As far as I could tell,
yep.

241
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,222
Until I talked to you,

242
00:11:59,224 --> 00:12:00,457
I thought we were hunting
a human, too,

243
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:01,992
maybe a serial killer.

244
00:12:01,994 --> 00:12:03,427
It'd be the first one
in Sioux Falls since --

245
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:06,663
Well, since
Robert Leroy Anderson.

246
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,167
Yeah. Yeah, so, um...

247
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:12,002
So I figure this area
between the crime scenes,

248
00:12:12,004 --> 00:12:13,470
it's the best place
to start looking

249
00:12:13,472 --> 00:12:15,972
for whatever this is.

250
00:12:15,974 --> 00:12:17,974
Should we wait
till, uh, daybreak?

251
00:12:17,976 --> 00:12:19,609
Why?

252
00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:22,179
No, let's go.

253
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:23,313
Yeah, uh --

254
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:56,813
- I can't find it.
- Find what?

255
00:12:56,815 --> 00:12:58,715
The book.

256
00:12:58,717 --> 00:13:01,051
It's got to be around here
somewhere.

257
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:03,386
She said to look
in the White Magic Lexicon.

258
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:05,455
Okay, um...
I-Is it this one?

259
00:13:05,457 --> 00:13:08,725
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

260
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:22,873
Who's that?

261
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,242
It's a girl.
Lora.

262
00:13:25,244 --> 00:13:28,245
She's, um --
She's been enchanted.

263
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:30,580
Like "Sleeping Beauty."

264
00:13:30,582 --> 00:13:34,184
No. No, not like --

265
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:38,922
This aging spell, it's --
it's killing her.

266
00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:41,758
- Can't you just heal her?-
No. I tried.

267
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,861
But for some reason, this magic,
it's too knotted.

268
00:13:44,863 --> 00:13:48,198
So we contacted Rowena.
She suggested a reversal spell,

269
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,433
and we're reading up
on it now.

270
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,943
Are you going
somewhere?

271
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:08,518
No.

272
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:16,293
We'd make better time
if we split up.

273
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:18,295
Uh -- Uh, Dean,

274
00:14:18,297 --> 00:14:20,363
w-we'll be safer
if we stick together.

275
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:22,766
Yeah, if I get a vote,
I'm Team Stick Together.

276
00:14:24,102 --> 00:14:25,902
Fine.

277
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:44,054
Guys!

278
00:14:48,126 --> 00:14:49,826
Holy mother...

279
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,282
Vampires.

280
00:15:17,856 --> 00:15:20,690
Jody,
these match your vics?

281
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:23,426
They were John Does.
Hard to tell.

282
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:25,195
Three heads,
three headless bodies --

283
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:26,496
the math works.

284
00:15:26,498 --> 00:15:29,032
Except, Sam,
I checked those bodies.

285
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:30,367
I brought
tissue samples home.

286
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:32,769
Alex ran them underneath
microscope.

287
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:34,270
Silver, Dead Man's Blood --

288
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:36,206
there was no reaction.

289
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:50,246
What the hell?

290
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:52,615
It looked just like her,
like...

291
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:54,451
Kaia.

292
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:56,386
You saw her die over there,
right?

293
00:16:56,388 --> 00:16:58,688
- Yes, absolutely.
- Then what's happening?

294
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,590
All I know is that thing --
it dressed the same

295
00:17:00,592 --> 00:17:02,425
and it moved the same
as the thing that killed Kaia.

296
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:03,426
Yeah.

297
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:05,695
How is that
possible?

298
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:07,430
I don't know.

299
00:17:07,432 --> 00:17:09,966
But let's find her
and ask.

300
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:15,455
"Sage, pyrite,
and sheep's eye"?

301
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,083
- We got that here?
- Yes.

302
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,677
Storage room, red cabinet,
bottom drawer.

303
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,646
It's marked
"gross stuff."

304
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:35,558
Oh, it's okay.

305
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,164
Is that your dad?

306
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,634
One of them, yes.

307
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,740
Do you have parents
or someone we can call?

308
00:17:50,742 --> 00:17:54,510
My mom, but...

309
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:57,380
she probably hates me.

310
00:17:57,382 --> 00:17:58,915
Why?

311
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:02,316
Because I left.

312
00:18:02,318 --> 00:18:05,886
I ran away.

313
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:07,988
I hated school,

314
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,125
I hated our crappy
one-stop-light town,

315
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:14,628
and I hated her rules.

316
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,897
I was sick of being
treated like a kid.

317
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:18,999
I thought I could make it
on my own,

318
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:20,698
but then I met her.

319
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,432
The witch?

320
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,868
She took me in --

321
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,271
me and two other girls.

322
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,708
At first, we didn't
want to leave.

323
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,577
She fed us,

324
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:37,581
gave us all nice things.

325
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:44,354
She was...kind.

326
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:47,457
She said having us there
kept her young.

327
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,262
But then she...

328
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,764
She got mean.

329
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,801
She locked us up.

330
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:02,472
Rachel started getting sick,
just like this.

331
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,645
And then Talli,
same thing.

332
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:15,919
They withered away...

333
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,587
to nothing.

334
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:24,895
When your friend showed up...

335
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:28,832
I thought I was saved.

336
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,669
But then it started
taking me, too,

337
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,906
even faster
than the others.

338
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:44,848
Cass is gonna
fix this.

339
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,017
I promise.

340
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,861
Dean?

341
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,698
Dean, what is it?

342
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,267
She's got a light foot,
but she's still leaving tracks.

343
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,869
Okay, hold up, hold up.
Wait -- Wait a second.

344
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,304
What?

345
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,805
Her face.

346
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,340
You saw it, too --
the bruises.

347
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,608
That could've been vamps.

348
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,411
Or it could've been Michael.
Come on.

349
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,846
Three vamps in Sioux Falls
and not a single civilian death.

350
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,683
That's not an accident.
I think <i>they</i> were hunting <i>her.</i>

351
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:20,984
Why?

352
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,686
I think because
Michael sent them

353
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,654
to finish what he started.
- Okay, we don't know that.

354
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,657
Jody tested the bodies, Dean.
They're different.

355
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,793
They're -- They're
immune to Dead Man's Blood

356
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,127
the same way
Michael's werewolves

357
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,597
were immune to silver.

358
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,702
Doesn't change the plan.

359
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,371
Yeah, but, Dean...

360
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:24,481
Cantamen solvatur,

361
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,584
cantamen revertatur.

362
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,587
Cantamen solvatur,

363
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,723
cantamen revertatur.

364
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,693
Cantamen solvatur,

365
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,195
cantamen revertatur.

366
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,573
How are you feeling?

367
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:54,110
I-I-I don't know.

368
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,284
Lora?

369
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,853
No.

370
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,189
No.

371
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,024
Help.

372
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,726
Help.

373
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,748
All good?

374
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,117
Ah, the girls are
asking for me.

375
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,618
You gonna tell them?

376
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,289
They have a right to know,
but I can't.

377
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,591
I promised Claire human cases
are mine,

378
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,927
but anything monster-y,
I'd loop her in.

379
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,228
But this...

380
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,663
Aw.

381
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,065
Claire's been doing so good,
and, I mean,

382
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,434
anything connected to Kaia,
she's a powder keg.

383
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,336
Hm.

384
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:56,606
First love strikes quick,
and to lose it like that...

385
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,174
Oh.

386
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,009
Well, you two are having
a time of it.

387
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,679
Yeah.

388
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,414
He's working something out.

389
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,416
And he's working it out alone.

390
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,585
Only thing I know --

391
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,520
He's not ready
for this case.

392
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,021
Maybe.

393
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:14,457
Maybe he needs it.

394
00:24:17,231 --> 00:24:19,398
What are you?

395
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,867
If you're asking
if I'm the girl you knew,

396
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,736
your Kaia,

397
00:24:23,738 --> 00:24:25,771
no.

398
00:24:25,773 --> 00:24:28,407
Then what?

399
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:30,776
You're from, uh...

400
00:24:30,778 --> 00:24:32,244
over there, yeah?

401
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:33,412
You know I am.

402
00:24:33,414 --> 00:24:35,281
So you're Kaia's double?

403
00:24:35,283 --> 00:24:36,382
Hmm?

404
00:24:36,384 --> 00:24:39,251
Like Bad Cass
or New Bobby.

405
00:24:39,253 --> 00:24:42,288
What <i>I</i> was to her,
<i>she</i> was to me,

406
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,090
you could never
understand.

407
00:24:44,092 --> 00:24:45,391
Why did you kill her?

408
00:24:45,393 --> 00:24:48,594
That was an accident.

409
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:50,763
I was trying
to kill the blonde.

410
00:24:57,905 --> 00:24:59,105
All right.

411
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:00,806
How'd you cross over?

412
00:25:00,808 --> 00:25:03,776
How'd you open a rift?

413
00:25:06,748 --> 00:25:08,614
Okay.

414
00:25:08,616 --> 00:25:09,815
Why are you here?

415
00:25:09,817 --> 00:25:12,785
You mean right here?

416
00:25:12,787 --> 00:25:15,187
'Cause of him.

417
00:25:15,189 --> 00:25:17,023
Yeah, not him,

418
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:18,624
not Michael,
not anymore.

419
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:20,159
I know.

420
00:25:20,161 --> 00:25:21,827
You're much weaker.

421
00:25:29,604 --> 00:25:30,803
Maybe.

422
00:25:30,805 --> 00:25:32,204
But you're still scared.

423
00:25:32,206 --> 00:25:34,473
Not of you.

424
00:25:34,475 --> 00:25:36,642
Of them --

425
00:25:36,644 --> 00:25:39,845
the monsters
he sends after me.

426
00:25:39,847 --> 00:25:44,183
Every time I slow down,
there's more.

427
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:46,118
There's always more.

428
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:10,576
Jack...

429
00:26:13,247 --> 00:26:15,014
We let her die.

430
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,763
I'm --
I'm sorry.

431
00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:35,601
If -- If I still had my powers,
I could've saved you.

432
00:26:35,603 --> 00:26:38,737
I...

433
00:27:00,928 --> 00:27:04,029
Jack,
what are you doing?

434
00:27:04,031 --> 00:27:06,632
The witch.

435
00:27:06,634 --> 00:27:08,701
Where's her body?

436
00:27:08,703 --> 00:27:10,035
Guys, we should move this,

437
00:27:10,037 --> 00:27:11,804
take her to the station
just to be safe.

438
00:27:11,806 --> 00:27:15,574
No, we need to break her
right here, right now.

439
00:27:15,576 --> 00:27:17,243
Break her?

440
00:27:17,673 --> 00:27:20,373
What do you mean "break her"?
For what?

441
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,976
He wants to know
where I hid my weapon.

442
00:27:22,978 --> 00:27:25,211
That's all he wants.

443
00:27:25,213 --> 00:27:26,846
That's what this
is all about.

444
00:27:36,158 --> 00:27:39,392
The witch-killing bullet --
It's still in her.

445
00:27:39,394 --> 00:27:40,927
Guess so.

446
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:42,596
Jack,
what is this about?

447
00:27:42,598 --> 00:27:44,931
Dean, what,
you're gonna hurt her?

448
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:46,232
Torture her?

449
00:27:46,234 --> 00:27:47,901
That pig-sticker
she's hiding --

450
00:27:47,903 --> 00:27:50,203
it is the only thing that
we know that hurts Michael.

451
00:27:50,205 --> 00:27:52,372
I'm gonna do
whatever it takes.

452
00:27:57,512 --> 00:27:58,845
Where is it?

453
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:01,014
Where's the spear?

454
00:28:01,016 --> 00:28:03,883
Where is it?!

455
00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:05,852
The witch told Lora
she and the others

456
00:28:05,854 --> 00:28:07,120
"kept her young."

457
00:28:07,122 --> 00:28:08,455
I thought
it was a metaphor,

458
00:28:08,457 --> 00:28:11,758
but the witch was
stealing their youth.

459
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,627
When you killed her,

460
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:16,529
maybe the magic kept working,
sucking Lora's life-force,

461
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:19,099
trying to keep the witch young,
to keep her alive,

462
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:21,034
but it couldn't work

463
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:24,604
because the bullet
was still inside her.

464
00:28:24,606 --> 00:28:29,042
So the magic worked
harder and harder

465
00:28:29,044 --> 00:28:31,478
and consumed more and more
of Lora.

466
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,648
That's why the reversal spell
didn't work.

467
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,616
<i>She</i> wasn't cursed.

468
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:42,622
<i>This</i> was.

469
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:54,334
- Where is it?
- Dean...

470
00:28:54,336 --> 00:28:56,102
You're no different
than him --

471
00:28:56,104 --> 00:29:01,408
threats, violence,
anything to get what you want.

472
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,977
I am nothing
like him.

473
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:06,513
Yeah, you are.
You always have been.

474
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:19,993
Lora's life-force --
It's in here.

475
00:29:19,995 --> 00:29:21,361
Jack, are you sure?

476
00:29:21,363 --> 00:29:22,295
No.

477
00:29:46,488 --> 00:29:47,987
What happened?

478
00:29:55,497 --> 00:29:59,199
I saw what
you did to her.

479
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:01,735
When you got angry,

480
00:30:01,737 --> 00:30:05,472
you shoved your gun
in her face.

481
00:30:05,474 --> 00:30:06,673
Get in the damn car!

482
00:30:12,748 --> 00:30:15,048
How do you know
about that?

483
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,549
Wait a second.

484
00:30:16,551 --> 00:30:18,885
You're a dreamwalker, too.

485
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:21,020
Your powers --
They connected you.

486
00:30:21,022 --> 00:30:22,388
Our whole lives.

487
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:25,558
What she saw, I saw.

488
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,727
I know where
it comes from --

489
00:30:27,729 --> 00:30:30,930
your anger,
your impatience.

490
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:32,565
It's fear.

491
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:35,935
You're scared.

492
00:30:35,937 --> 00:30:37,570
And you're weak.

493
00:30:37,572 --> 00:30:39,739
All right. Shut up.

494
00:30:39,741 --> 00:30:41,941
Michael hurt you.

495
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:45,612
He hurt me, too.

496
00:30:57,926 --> 00:31:01,728
I didn't come here
to fight.

497
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:05,031
Not if I don't have to.

498
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:09,068
This face you know,
but I'm just borrowing it.

499
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,104
We haven't met.

500
00:31:11,106 --> 00:31:13,573
But I've sensed you

501
00:31:13,575 --> 00:31:16,042
ever since I came
to this world.

502
00:31:16,044 --> 00:31:19,746
You're like me.
You bleed new energy.

503
00:31:19,748 --> 00:31:21,414
So does that.

504
00:31:24,886 --> 00:31:27,487
I'm here
to make you an offer.

505
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:30,056
There's a war coming,
and I'm building an army.

506
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:32,559
You can join my side,
the winning side,

507
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:34,928
if you give me that spear.

508
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:38,264
Or you can fight,
definitely lose,

509
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:41,434
probably die,
and then I'll just take it.

510
00:31:41,436 --> 00:31:45,205
So, Wild One...
what's it gonna be?

511
00:31:57,752 --> 00:31:59,419
Stop.

512
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:01,354
You remember now?

513
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:14,300
So Michael wants the spear

514
00:32:14,302 --> 00:32:16,636
because he knows
it can hurt him,

515
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:18,872
and that's why his monsters
are coming after you.

516
00:32:18,874 --> 00:32:20,039
Yes.

517
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:22,675
Dean, we should get
out of here.

518
00:32:22,677 --> 00:32:24,711
Unh-unh. Guys...

519
00:32:28,316 --> 00:32:30,450
Too late.

520
00:32:40,443 --> 00:32:42,844
We only came for her,

521
00:32:42,846 --> 00:32:45,980
but I was never one
to turn down a buffet.

522
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:28,356
Those spiked bullets
don't hurt us anymore.

523
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:47,575
Now you're in trouble.

524
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:53,715
Or not.

525
00:33:53,717 --> 00:33:55,616
Slippery one,
isn't she?

526
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:01,422
Aaah!

527
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:40,828
You saved us.

528
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,563
You didn't have to.

529
00:34:42,565 --> 00:34:44,599
I came back for them,
not you.

530
00:34:54,144 --> 00:34:56,944
You know, as long
as you have that spear,

531
00:34:56,946 --> 00:34:58,613
you're gonna be
a target --

532
00:34:58,615 --> 00:35:01,115
for Michael,
his monsters.

533
00:35:01,117 --> 00:35:02,517
They'll keep chasing you.

534
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,185
I'm used to it.

535
00:35:30,242 --> 00:35:31,842
- Jody...
- Dean Winchester,

536
00:35:31,844 --> 00:35:35,045
you have
nothing to apologize for.

537
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:39,616
- How is the arm?
- Yeah, you sure

538
00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:41,051
you don't want a ride
to the hospital or --

539
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:43,453
I've driven with
a broken arm before.

540
00:35:43,455 --> 00:35:44,922
More worried about
what I'm gonna tell Alex

541
00:35:44,924 --> 00:35:46,089
when I get there.

542
00:35:46,091 --> 00:35:47,991
And then,
once I get home...

543
00:35:47,993 --> 00:35:49,226
Claire?

544
00:35:49,228 --> 00:35:52,596
Yeah.

545
00:35:52,598 --> 00:35:56,099
I'm dreading
those consequences.

546
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:57,434
She's got to know.

547
00:35:57,436 --> 00:35:58,902
She's got to know
that Kaia's killer

548
00:35:58,904 --> 00:36:01,738
is still out there.

549
00:36:03,576 --> 00:36:07,411
You all right?

550
00:36:07,413 --> 00:36:10,714
It's just, you know,
seeing her face again.

551
00:36:15,087 --> 00:36:17,988
Raising three Hunters
and fearing every day

552
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:22,793
that I might lose
one of them...

553
00:36:22,795 --> 00:36:24,728
Didn't really even get
a chance to know Kaia

554
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,597
before she Di--

555
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:36,406
I just feel
like I already lost

556
00:36:36,408 --> 00:36:38,976
before I ever even began.

557
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,029
Come in.

558
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:04,434
Well, uh...
Jules is off.

559
00:37:04,436 --> 00:37:08,472
She's taking Lora back home
to her mother.

560
00:37:08,474 --> 00:37:11,675
Jack, I just wanted to say,
I'm -- I'm sorry.

561
00:37:11,677 --> 00:37:14,144
I know that you've been
going through a lot lately.

562
00:37:14,146 --> 00:37:15,512
We've all been going
through a lot.

563
00:37:15,514 --> 00:37:17,614
It's just no excuse.

564
00:37:17,616 --> 00:37:21,118
I-I just haven't
been there for you,

565
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,819
not the way I should've.

566
00:37:22,821 --> 00:37:26,123
Cass, it's okay.

567
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:30,494
Well...
what you did today,

568
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:34,631
you just
made me so proud.

569
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:39,002
You know, learning
to hold your own in a fight

570
00:37:39,004 --> 00:37:40,637
without your powers,
that takes time

571
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:45,242
and -- and training,
but today, you --

572
00:37:45,244 --> 00:37:48,879
you proved that you have
the mind of a Hunter

573
00:37:48,881 --> 00:37:52,749
and the heart of a Hunter.

574
00:37:52,751 --> 00:37:55,218
I was thinking, um...

575
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,554
I mean, I'll talk
to Sam and Dean,

576
00:37:57,556 --> 00:37:59,823
but, um, I thought maybe --

577
00:37:59,825 --> 00:38:03,026
maybe we could
go on a Hunting trip.

578
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:05,896
I mean, if you want to.

579
00:38:07,433 --> 00:38:08,498
Yeah.

580
00:38:11,103 --> 00:38:14,237
Yes.

581
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:23,280
Sorry.

582
00:38:23,282 --> 00:38:24,948
You okay?

583
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:27,250
I'm fine.

584
00:38:27,252 --> 00:38:29,886
I'm human now.

585
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,589
Must be getting
my first cold.

586
00:38:32,591 --> 00:38:34,958
Well, I'll make you
some soup, then.

587
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:53,143
I put us all in danger
today.

588
00:38:53,145 --> 00:38:56,213
Stupid danger.

589
00:38:56,215 --> 00:38:57,714
Dean...

590
00:38:57,716 --> 00:39:01,384
You were right.

591
00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:06,389
I didn't want to look at it,
what Michael used me for.

592
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:08,992
I just wanted to race ahead,
you know,

593
00:39:08,994 --> 00:39:11,561
skip to the end of the story,
the part where I get the weapon

594
00:39:11,563 --> 00:39:13,663
and I take out
the bad guy --

595
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:16,266
the part where
I kill Michael.

596
00:39:16,268 --> 00:39:20,303
Yeah, I know.

597
00:39:20,305 --> 00:39:23,974
You know, I said yes to him
because I thought...

598
00:39:26,145 --> 00:39:27,811
It was stupid.

599
00:39:27,813 --> 00:39:29,780
<i>I</i> was stupid.

600
00:39:29,782 --> 00:39:31,948
Dean...

601
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,518
you did what
you had to do.

602
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:43,193
And it wasn't a blink,

603
00:39:43,195 --> 00:39:46,696
being possessed.

604
00:39:46,698 --> 00:39:49,199
I made it sound like that,
but it wasn't.

605
00:39:52,104 --> 00:39:56,606
I don't remember most
of what Michael did with me

606
00:39:56,608 --> 00:39:59,643
because I was underwater,

607
00:39:59,645 --> 00:40:01,678
drowning,

608
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,081
and that I remember.

609
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,884
I felt every second
of it --

610
00:40:07,886 --> 00:40:11,021
clawing,
fighting for air.

611
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:18,228
I thought I could make it out,
but I -- I...

612
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:22,866
I couldn't.
I wasn't strong enough.

613
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:24,334
And now he's gone

614
00:40:24,336 --> 00:40:26,736
and he's out there

615
00:40:26,738 --> 00:40:28,538
putting an army of monsters
together

616
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,841
and he's hurting people.

617
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,015
And it's all on me, man.

618
00:40:39,017 --> 00:40:41,084
I said yes.

619
00:40:44,923 --> 00:40:47,390
It's my fault.
