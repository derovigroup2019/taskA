1
00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:03,292
I say that I do
the terrible things I do

2
00:00:03,293 --> 00:00:06,616
because I couldn't find
who killed Sarah and Teddy.

3
00:00:06,617 --> 00:00:07,680
But I lied.

4
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:08,881
Truth is...

5
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:10,849
I like
doing these things,

6
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:12,518
and I don't want to stop.

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,253
Even if you could
force me out,

8
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:15,587
what do you think
I'd leave behind?

9
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:18,123
You'd be nothing
but blood and bone.

10
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,492
Then we don't
kick him out. We keep him in.

11
00:00:23,163 --> 00:00:24,696
It's just you.

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,461
- Michael's all locked up.
- Seems that way.

13
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,629
Do you remember visiting
my reading room?

14
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,765
The shelves and shelves
of notebooks

15
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,867
describing the ways
you might die?

16
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,269
They all end
the same way now --

17
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:39,704
except one.

18
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,339
What am I supposed to do
with this?

19
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,508
That's up to you.

20
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:55,120
Never been caught
by a human before.

21
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:58,189
You some kind of Hunter?

22
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,925
No.
No, I know a couple.

23
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:04,963
Picked up some tricks.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,767
And a few other things.

25
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:12,437
Well, if you're not a Hunter,
let's make a deal.

26
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,605
Mnh-mnh.

27
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,940
No deals.

28
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,743
What do you want?

29
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,912
Abraxas.

30
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,514
Yeah,
the last demon I killed

31
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:26,317
said you and Abraxas
made quite the team

32
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,120
until he was captured
by a Hunter.

33
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,823
You left your pal
in the lurch,

34
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,725
but you know
who got him.

35
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,660
If I was there.

36
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:41,132
The Hunter who caught him,
who almost got me --

37
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,334
why would I
protect them?

38
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,638
Hell, I can even tell you
where to find 'em.

39
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,544
So...no need
for any of this.

40
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,212
Oh,
I don't know.

41
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,814
Where's the fun
in that?

42
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,415
Hibbing!

43
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:01,753
She's in
Hibbing, Minnesota.

47
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:59,010
How you feeling?

48
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,245
What you reading?

49
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,113
Uh, going back through
the Book of Jubilees.

50
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,849
You know, the way
they classify angels is -- is --

51
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,084
it's really interesting.

52
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,385
Find anything
on Michael?

53
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,554
Not yet, but I -- but I --
but I just started.

54
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,394
We'll find a way.

55
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,830
Man, I-I-I...

56
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:23,301
I appreciate it,
you know, you...trying.

57
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,903
Well, yeah.

58
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,371
Of course.

59
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,407
I mean, always.

60
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,309
You want to hop in,
help out?

61
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,077
I got plenty
to go through.

62
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,512
Actually, I-I -- I thought

63
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,047
I'd go for a --
a drive, you know?

64
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,783
Just me and Baby,
long stretch of road.

65
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,286
And figured
I'd make it a twofer --

66
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:45,023
I'd go see Mom
at, uh, Donna's cabin.

67
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,357
Yeah.

68
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,927
Yeah,
Th-that sounds great.

69
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,862
Be good
to see 'em.

70
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,797
Just let me, uh,
find a stopping point

71
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,165
and get packed up.

72
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,135
Uh, actually, I was, uh...

73
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,336
was kind of hoping for

74
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,405
some one-on-one time
with Mom,

75
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,006
if that's cool.

76
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:09,747
Ye-- uh...Sure, yeah.

77
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,317
Whatever you need.

78
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:20,024
Okay.

79
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,832
Take care, Sammy.

80
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,940
Yeah,
he called last night.

81
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,375
Said it was just
a supply run,

82
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,944
but I'll take any excuse
for a visit.

83
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,614
Cabin's been
a little quiet lately.

84
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,781
Quiet?

85
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,384
Yeah, uh,
Bobby took off for a few days.

86
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,685
It's fine.

87
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,755
Just after everything
that happened with his son,

88
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,758
we needed
a little space.

89
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,960
Yeah.

90
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,663
Sam?

91
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,832
Sorry, I'm just --
I'm worried, you know?

92
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,667
Ever since
we locked Michael up,

93
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,235
Dean's been
acting strange,

94
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,970
and he just packed up
and left,

95
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,872
and then, uh...

96
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,374
And what?

97
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,342
He hugged me.

98
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,645
That's sweet.

99
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,480
Mom,
we don't hug.

100
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,081
I mean, w-we do,

101
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:21,019
but only if it's literally
the end of the world, you know?

102
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,487
Sam,
he'll be here soon.

103
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,122
I'll look after him.

104
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,424
- I'll get to the bottom of this.
- Yeah, all right.

105
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,359
M-Maybe it's like you said,
you know?

106
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,529
Maybe he just need some space,
like Bobby.

107
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,630
Yeah.

108
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,032
Well, and until
we know for sure,

109
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,233
we have to
respect that.

110
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,001
Yeah, you're right.
Uh, I -- I...

111
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,838
Yeah, uh...

112
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,373
talk soon.

113
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,521
Mmm. Oh, my God.

114
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,122
What?
You thought I was joking?

115
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,660
Best burger
in Minnesota.

116
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,861
Best burger ever.

117
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,164
- Glad it satisfied.
- Oh.

118
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,367
So good.

119
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,704
So, Dean.

120
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,772
Have you seen
Jody lately, hm?

121
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,040
The girls?

122
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,275
Oh, yeah.

123
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:21,279
You know,
I split my time as much I can,

124
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,414
help Jody
with their training.

125
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,149
Last month,
we took down a Vetala nest.

126
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,432
Mm-hmm.

127
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:28,754
Alex, little miss
"I don't want to Hunt"?

128
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,488
She killed two
all by herself.

129
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,423
Get out of town.

130
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,125
Good for her.

131
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,161
Anyhoo...

132
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,896
Now, what about you?

133
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,331
How's sheriffing going?

134
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,900
I know it was a little tough
last time, what with, uh...

135
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,302
- Doug, yeah.
- Yeah.

136
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,137
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

137
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,375
Yeah, you know,
the split was rough.

138
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,179
Doug's working
private security now,

139
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,481
up in Duluth.

140
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,751
Okay.

141
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,019
Any more questions?

142
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,721
Huh?

143
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,089
Just wondering

144
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,258
if you've run out of ways
to ask me how I'm doing,

145
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,661
so as to avoid me
repaying the favor.

146
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:15,233
I know you were
just possessed, again.

147
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,469
Sam.

148
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,737
He had us all out
looking for you.

149
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,172
And I know
you got an archangel

150
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,207
hitching a ride
up there in your noggin.

151
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:25,282
Also Sam.

152
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:27,179
What, does he got
a freakin' newsletter?

153
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,046
I'm just saying,
all that,

154
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,249
it can't be easy,
you know?

155
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,591
Well...

156
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,461
I'll make it through,
okay?

157
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,697
That's all we can do,
right?

158
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,333
Right.

159
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,470
Couldn't come through town
without seeing my D-train,

160
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,971
so thanks
for meeting me.

161
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,907
Oh, yeah.

162
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,075
Come here.

163
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,311
Oh.

164
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,512
Ohh.

165
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,681
You betcha.

166
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,153
I'll see ya,
Donna.

167
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,992
Hey, Mom.

168
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,528
You're here.

169
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,933
Yeah. Thought I'd stick around
for a couple days, if that's cool.

170
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,168
Of course.

171
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,370
Uh,
Bobby's gone.

172
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,273
We have a big couch
and a pull-out.

173
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,608
- Perfect.
- Awesome.

174
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,911
You know, if you wanted
to make it a full reunion,

175
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,613
we could
call Sam over.

176
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,715
Yeah, you know,
I was thinking

177
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,084
I'd actually be a little greedy
with my Mom time,

178
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,952
if that's cool.

179
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,288
Well, I just thought, you know,
if you're staying a few nights...

180
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,890
I don't want Sam here.

181
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,926
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, no.

182
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,228
You know what? I just --
I'm -- I'm hangry, okay?

183
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,164
Long drive,
haven't eaten,

184
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,535
and, uh, I'm starving,
actually.

185
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:33,137
Well, uh,
the delivery options

186
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,472
are a little limited
this far out,

187
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:38,075
and we both know
I'm not much of a cook.

188
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,144
Well, there's one thing
you can cook

189
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,446
better than anybody
on the planet.

190
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,122
Winchester Surprise?

191
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,623
Yeah.

192
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,058
I can't believe
you remember that.

193
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,428
I can't believe I ever fed that
to you and John.

194
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,498
It was so greasy,
like...

195
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,433
Heart attack
on a plate.

196
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,835
A delicious heart attack
on a plate, okay?

197
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:08,105
I would like mine
with extra cheese.

198
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,542
All right,
then.

199
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,578
Yes.

200
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,013
Oh, and, uh...

201
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,049
Pie.

202
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,735
Well, Donna certainly has
a type.

203
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,295
All right.

204
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,726
? No time left for you ?

205
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,795
? On my way to better things ?

206
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,897
? No time left for you ?

207
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,033
? I found myself some wings ?
? No time left for you ?

208
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:19,804
? Distant roads are callin' me ?
? No time left for you ?

209
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:23,474
? Time, time, time, time, time ?

210
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:27,278
? No time for a summer friend ?

211
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,781
? No time
for the love you send ?

212
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:34,585
? Seasons change, and so did I ?

213
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,656
? You need not wonder why ?

214
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:41,959
? You need not wonder why ?

215
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:46,263
? There's no time left for you ?

216
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:51,702
? No time left for you ?

217
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:55,740
? I got, got, got, got no time ?

218
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:59,543
? No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no time ?

219
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,879
Hey.
Need a hand?

220
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,347
- Hey, Joe.
- Yeah.

221
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,782
Thanks.

222
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,418
That's new.

223
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,753
What?

224
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,621
You buying food.

225
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,022
I just mean
you usually only pick up

226
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,691
whiskey, pumpkins,
and crossword puzzles.

227
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,259
Well...

228
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,962
crosswords do get better
with whiskey.

229
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,430
Oh.

230
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,731
And I got family
in town.

231
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,166
- Oh, nice. Well, enjoy.
- Yeah.

232
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,301
- Thanks.
- See you later.

233
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,079
Hey, man. Excuse me.

234
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,047
- Hey. Can I help you?
- Yeah, yeah, I think you can.

235
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,783
I'm looking
for a friend of mine --

236
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,251
Mary Winchester.

237
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,987
Sorry.
I don't know her.

238
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,789
Well, she told me to meet her
here in Hibbing,

239
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,291
so if you could just point me
in the right direction,

240
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,627
we're all good,
you know?

241
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,833
Thanks for nothing,
pal.

242
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:28,432
Ah...damn it.

243
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:34,071
Oh, come on, man.

244
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,243
Hiya.

245
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,745
Evening, Officer.

246
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:21,771
You can't --
I didn't do anything.

247
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:23,005
Oh, sure ya did.

248
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:25,675
You see,
I ran the plates,

249
00:15:25,677 --> 00:15:28,110
and this van here?

250
00:15:28,112 --> 00:15:30,913
Belongs to an 80-year-old lady
in Missoula.

251
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:32,014
Yeah.

252
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:34,650
My Grammy,
she lets me borrow it.

253
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:35,885
No.

254
00:15:35,887 --> 00:15:38,688
Grammy reported it stolen
two weeks ago.

255
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,691
And word has it you're looking
for a friend of mine,

256
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:43,159
Mary Winchester.

257
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:45,027
No, I -- I-I talked
to the kid

258
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:47,196
about renting a place
for fishing.

259
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:49,532
Oh. Huh.

260
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:52,234
You catch a lot of fish
with that Arkansas toothpick

261
00:15:52,236 --> 00:15:55,771
you got there
on the passenger seat?

262
00:15:55,773 --> 00:15:57,340
So...

263
00:15:57,342 --> 00:15:59,508
what's your name?

264
00:16:00,445 --> 00:16:02,912
"Nunya."

265
00:16:02,914 --> 00:16:04,680
What's that?

266
00:16:04,682 --> 00:16:07,550
- First name, Eat, last name, Me.
- Okay.

267
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:12,788
You see this?

268
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,624
Mobile
fingerprint scanner.

269
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:18,260
Cost the force
a pretty penny,

270
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:21,397
but I figured
it'd come in handy.

271
00:16:25,303 --> 00:16:27,036
You won't
give it to me straight...

272
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:30,039
...but this will.

273
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:35,878
Uff da.

274
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,316
You're a long way
from Delaware, Nick.

275
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:44,954
Ugh. Aah!

276
00:16:53,965 --> 00:16:55,231
Okay, sicko.

277
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:56,665
That's enough.

278
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:15,684
Hey.

279
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:17,253
Hey. What were you doing
out there?

280
00:17:17,255 --> 00:17:19,021
Oh, I, uh...

281
00:17:19,023 --> 00:17:20,055
Oh, here.

282
00:17:20,057 --> 00:17:22,091
You know,
I'm just, uh...

283
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:24,994
taking a look around.

284
00:17:24,996 --> 00:17:26,328
Come on inside.

285
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:29,532
I got a surprise
for you.

286
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:42,812
What's all this?

287
00:17:42,814 --> 00:17:44,113
Well,
I wanted to make sure

288
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:46,048
everything was ready
for you.

289
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:50,386
And I thought I'd, uh --
I'd give you a hand, you know?

290
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:52,021
Two terrible cooks
teaming up.

291
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:54,123
What could possibly
go wrong?

292
00:17:58,196 --> 00:17:59,628
What?

293
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,230
Nothing.

294
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:13,876
Listen, Mom, I-I --
I think I should come up.

295
00:18:13,878 --> 00:18:16,912
Uh, there's some stuff missing
from the bunker, and --

296
00:18:16,914 --> 00:18:19,014
Sam, I don't know
what's going on,

297
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,283
but something
is going on.

298
00:18:21,285 --> 00:18:23,319
Just give me
some time.

299
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:25,888
Let me
talk to him, okay?

300
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,189
Okay, yeah.

301
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:30,259
Um, yeah.
All right, Mom.

302
00:18:37,902 --> 00:18:39,568
He comes back,
he's standing there,

303
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,270
he's soaking wet,
and he's pulling bologna

304
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:43,372
and sliced cheese out of his pants.

305
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:46,609
So, me being the big brother,
I'm the cook.

306
00:18:46,611 --> 00:18:48,677
I take all of that bologna,
all that sliced cheese,

307
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:50,346
and I put it
onto a hot plate.

308
00:18:50,348 --> 00:18:51,981
- No.
- Yeah.

309
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:54,917
- Oh.
- It stunk up that room so bad.

310
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:57,586
Dad comes home,
and he is so mad.

311
00:18:57,588 --> 00:18:59,955
He picks up everything,
chucks it in the trash.

312
00:18:59,957 --> 00:19:02,658
Probably reminded him of you,
and...

313
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:09,131
Anyway,
it did not taste right.

314
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:12,268
It didn't taste
like this.

315
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,941
Oh.

316
00:19:18,943 --> 00:19:24,146
Sometimes I forget just how much
I missed while I was gone

317
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:27,516
and how much
the two of you just...

318
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,223
But you're here now, right?

319
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:36,258
And even though
the last couple of years

320
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,260
have been
a little rough,

321
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:41,764
just knowing
that you're around,

322
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:43,933
that you're alive...

323
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:48,437
Mom, that's meant everything
to me.

324
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:50,940
And everything
to Sam.

325
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,677
And how great
is this, hm?

326
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:57,813
You, me, sitting here,
eating the real thing,

327
00:19:57,815 --> 00:20:00,549
not some bologna version
of Winchester Surprise?

328
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:02,985
You know,
we're not fighting any monsters.

329
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:07,122
There's -- There's no clouds
on the horizon.

330
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:12,995
Dean?

331
00:20:12,997 --> 00:20:14,396
Mm-hmm?

332
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,233
Whatever
you're going through,

333
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:20,703
you can talk to me.

334
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,010
Everybody keeps asking
how I am,

335
00:20:28,012 --> 00:20:34,116
and how I am is
I don't want to talk about it.

336
00:20:37,622 --> 00:20:40,756
Please.

337
00:21:50,061 --> 00:21:51,493
No.

338
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:54,096
No, no, no.

339
00:22:02,707 --> 00:22:04,039
Mnh.

340
00:22:13,784 --> 00:22:16,351
What?

341
00:22:16,353 --> 00:22:18,554
Oh, God.

342
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:27,062
Hey.

343
00:22:31,969 --> 00:22:33,936
Ah...

344
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:37,306
Hey, Donna. It's Dean.
What's up?

345
00:22:37,308 --> 00:22:38,907
He got
the drop on me.

346
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:41,210
Dean,
he's going after your mom.

347
00:22:41,212 --> 00:22:44,146
- He who?
- Uh, some guy named Nick.

348
00:22:49,253 --> 00:22:52,087
Dean! Whoa, easy!

349
00:22:54,158 --> 00:22:55,691
Dean,
what's going on here?

350
00:22:55,693 --> 00:22:57,092
It's Mom.

351
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:58,861
She's gone.

352
00:23:01,957 --> 00:23:04,092
The demons,
they know where you are.

353
00:23:04,094 --> 00:23:06,494
They keep track of you,
you and your kids.

354
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,962
They're sort of
scared of you.

355
00:23:07,964 --> 00:23:09,764
So wherever you are,
they're not.

356
00:23:09,766 --> 00:23:11,533
So that's how
I got to Hibbing.

357
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:13,701
I didn't have
an address.

358
00:23:13,703 --> 00:23:16,104
Luckily, that --
that perky sheriff lady --

359
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:17,272
what's her name?

360
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:20,108
Deborah? Debbie?
Something? Whatever.

361
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,342
She had, um...

362
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,511
She had some e-mails
on her cellphone

363
00:23:23,513 --> 00:23:25,847
talking about you
and her family cabin.

364
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:28,683
So, voil? --
here I am.

365
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:32,186
I know
that's a lot to take in, but...

366
00:23:32,188 --> 00:23:34,389
And if
you feel like screaming,

367
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:35,957
you can --
you can go ahead,

368
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:41,396
'cause we're...
pretty remote.

369
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:44,966
Nick?
What are you doing?

370
00:23:51,107 --> 00:23:53,741
Tonya Baker.

371
00:23:55,345 --> 00:23:58,046
Yeah, you knew her.
You saved her life.

372
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:01,950
Yeah, her whole Girl Scout troop
was murdered.

373
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:04,986
She was the only survivor,
thanks to you.

374
00:24:04,988 --> 00:24:08,323
These two demons
were about to finish her off,

375
00:24:08,325 --> 00:24:11,392
and then you came in,
and you chased one away.

376
00:24:11,394 --> 00:24:13,595
But you faced off
against the other one,

377
00:24:13,597 --> 00:24:16,431
a demon
named Abraxas.

378
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:19,567
I remember.
So?

379
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:23,237
So,
Abraxas murdered my family

380
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:27,642
the same way he killed
those girls --

381
00:24:27,644 --> 00:24:31,779
bloody, brutal, slow.

382
00:24:31,781 --> 00:24:34,015
I'm sorry,
Nick.

383
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:38,720
But you could have
just asked me.

384
00:24:38,722 --> 00:24:40,121
This is...

385
00:24:40,123 --> 00:24:42,624
Crazy?

386
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:43,825
Hm?

387
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:46,561
What would you
have told me?

388
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:48,229
That I killed him.

389
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:51,933
Abraxas is dead.

390
00:24:53,236 --> 00:24:56,804
So you would've
lied to me.

391
00:24:56,806 --> 00:25:00,208
His friend got away,
but she saw everything.

392
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,477
You didn't kill Abraxas.

393
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:05,013
You trapped him
in a box.

394
00:25:05,015 --> 00:25:06,614
How'd you do it?

395
00:25:06,616 --> 00:25:09,350
Uh...

396
00:25:09,352 --> 00:25:10,918
Tell me.

397
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,854
Okay,
you're right.

398
00:25:12,856 --> 00:25:14,055
I trapped him.

399
00:25:14,057 --> 00:25:16,457
We fought,
and he was winning.

400
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:19,227
So I put him in
an Enochian puzzle box.

401
00:25:19,229 --> 00:25:21,195
He's contained.

402
00:25:21,197 --> 00:25:23,064
Do you have him?

403
00:25:24,968 --> 00:25:26,100
No.

404
00:25:30,073 --> 00:25:32,907
But I can take you
to him.

405
00:25:53,129 --> 00:25:55,697
I got his tags,
put my guys on it.

406
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:58,299
They're running 'em.
I'm sorry.

407
00:25:58,301 --> 00:26:01,436
It's not your fault, Donna.
It's mine.

408
00:26:01,438 --> 00:26:03,538
Nick said when he left
he was just gonna go home.

409
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,906
I-I didn't know
he was...

410
00:26:04,908 --> 00:26:07,041
Killing people?

411
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:09,844
<i>- Sheriff?</i>
- Yeah. Go for Hanscum.

412
00:26:09,846 --> 00:26:11,512
<i>We got that van</i>
<i>you were looking for.</i>

413
00:26:11,514 --> 00:26:13,214
<i>A traffic cam</i>
<i>just caught it</i>

414
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:15,583
<i>pulling into a storage facility</i>
<i>outside Grand Rapids.</i>

415
00:26:15,585 --> 00:26:17,085
Copy that.
I got it from here.

416
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:19,387
- How far is Grand Rapids?
- 30, 40 minutes.

417
00:26:19,389 --> 00:26:21,622
We'll be there in 20.

418
00:27:06,202 --> 00:27:09,437
All right,
where is it?

419
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,707
Okay, if you do this,
we're done.

420
00:27:12,709 --> 00:27:16,477
You walk. Okay?

421
00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:19,847
Over there.

422
00:27:23,953 --> 00:27:25,953
You first.

423
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:04,725
Clever.

424
00:28:16,706 --> 00:28:20,241
All right,
where is it?

425
00:28:20,243 --> 00:28:22,443
In the lockers.

426
00:28:24,514 --> 00:28:26,414
Too bad
I forgot the keys.

427
00:28:38,895 --> 00:28:41,596
Which one?

428
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:48,836
All right,
fine.

429
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:55,276
Mnh.

430
00:29:13,963 --> 00:29:15,663
Bingo.

431
00:29:20,136 --> 00:29:21,269
Open it.

432
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:23,804
Me and 'Brax-y
have to have a talk.

433
00:29:25,174 --> 00:29:26,841
Well,
that's not gonna happen.

434
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:27,975
I'm sorry?

435
00:29:27,977 --> 00:29:30,344
To talk,
a demon needs a host.

436
00:29:30,346 --> 00:29:33,481
It can't be you.

437
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:35,950
Can't be me.

438
00:29:39,055 --> 00:29:41,689
Didn't really think
this through, did you, Nick?

439
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:45,693
So I'll improvise.

440
00:29:58,308 --> 00:30:00,174
Say it.

441
00:30:00,176 --> 00:30:02,944
I can see
you want to.

442
00:30:02,946 --> 00:30:05,046
Might as well
go ahead and say it.

443
00:30:05,048 --> 00:30:06,247
All right.

444
00:30:06,249 --> 00:30:07,949
Nick is not a project.

445
00:30:07,951 --> 00:30:09,917
He's not
a freakin' puppy.

446
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,253
He was Lucifer's vessel
for years.

447
00:30:12,255 --> 00:30:13,907
I know that, Dean.
I thought --

448
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:14,623
You thought he'd what?

449
00:30:14,624 --> 00:30:16,313
Just walk it off? Come on, man.
You're not that dumb.

450
00:30:16,337 --> 00:30:17,192
It's not about
being dumb, Dean.

451
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:18,826
It's called compassion.

452
00:30:18,828 --> 00:30:21,829
Look, what happened to Nick
could've happened to me.

453
00:30:21,831 --> 00:30:23,064
It <i>almost</i>
happened to me.

454
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:24,832
You change one little thing
in our past,

455
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:26,167
and that <i>was</i> me.

456
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:27,702
Lucifer wearing <i>me</i>
to the prom.

457
00:30:27,704 --> 00:30:29,937
And besides, since when
do we give up on people?

458
00:30:29,939 --> 00:30:31,605
Since when do we just
cut people loose?

459
00:30:31,607 --> 00:30:33,207
Well, maybe you need
to learn, okay?

460
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:35,343
'Cause when people are
past the point of saving,

461
00:30:35,345 --> 00:30:37,611
maybe you need to learn
to walk away.

462
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,409
Nick, don't do this.

463
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:53,675
Do what?

464
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:55,844
You let
that demon out of there,

465
00:30:55,846 --> 00:30:58,179
he could kill us.

466
00:30:58,181 --> 00:31:01,149
I can handle it.

467
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:05,587
How do you open
this thing?

468
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:07,088
I don't know.

469
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,823
Mnh.

470
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,725
I don't like you.

471
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,845
I said
I can handle it.

472
00:32:20,363 --> 00:32:24,098
I think there's only one way
to get into this box.

473
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,774
Come on, baby.

474
00:32:32,776 --> 00:32:34,642
Come on, baby.

475
00:33:05,876 --> 00:33:08,843
Heya, Blondie.

476
00:33:12,382 --> 00:33:13,615
Missed ya.

477
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,483
Why did you kill
my family?

478
00:33:15,485 --> 00:33:17,018
Who's he?

479
00:33:18,388 --> 00:33:21,523
Sorry, you're gonna have to be
more specific.

480
00:33:21,525 --> 00:33:23,157
Pike Creek, Delaware.

481
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:26,194
Oh...

482
00:33:26,196 --> 00:33:27,762
no way.

483
00:33:27,764 --> 00:33:29,163
Nick?

484
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:32,800
What are you doing
walking and talking?

485
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,637
I thought the Big Man
had you on lock.

486
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,472
Lucifer's dead.

487
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,173
Is he?

488
00:33:39,175 --> 00:33:40,542
Cool.

489
00:33:40,544 --> 00:33:43,511
Why did you kill
my family?

490
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:46,948
Kill your family,
yeah, got it.

491
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,750
Tell you what --

492
00:33:48,752 --> 00:33:52,687
I'll answer that
when you kill her.

493
00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:56,224
She locked me in a box,
and I hold a grudge.

494
00:33:58,028 --> 00:34:02,730
Do her slow and bloody,
then we'll chat.

495
00:34:04,768 --> 00:34:06,634
Nick.

496
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,245
Nick, no.

497
00:34:17,247 --> 00:34:18,479
Nick, hey!

498
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:21,115
Don't -- Stop --
N-No!

499
00:34:21,117 --> 00:34:23,017
Aah! Aah! Hey.

500
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,254
Get away from her!
Stay back.

501
00:34:31,494 --> 00:34:33,428
Is she all right?
She's good.

502
00:34:34,097 --> 00:34:36,564
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?

503
00:34:36,566 --> 00:34:38,766
What I have to.

504
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,637
- No, Nick --
- No!

505
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,938
Showtime.

506
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:59,621
You want to know
why I gutted your family?

507
00:34:59,623 --> 00:35:00,955
Orders.

508
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:03,891
I was
following orders.

509
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,293
From who?

510
00:35:05,295 --> 00:35:06,494
Who do you think?

511
00:35:06,496 --> 00:35:09,063
Lucifer planned
the whole thing.

512
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,866
I don't --
I don't understand.

513
00:35:11,868 --> 00:35:13,234
Why my family?

514
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,169
Why -- Why me?

515
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:16,471
No particular reason.

516
00:35:16,473 --> 00:35:19,941
You were chosen,
but you're not special.

517
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:22,143
We threw a dart
at the phone book.

518
00:35:22,145 --> 00:35:25,013
<i>Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus</i>
<i>spiritus, omnis satanica --</i>

519
00:35:25,015 --> 00:35:27,649
Naughty.

520
00:35:30,987 --> 00:35:32,286
So...

521
00:35:32,288 --> 00:35:35,023
who dies first?

522
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,760
Aah!

523
00:35:53,843 --> 00:35:56,144
Nick.

524
00:35:56,146 --> 00:35:57,812
Nick,
take it easy.

525
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:32,327
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

526
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:34,662
Donna. Hold on.

527
00:36:34,664 --> 00:36:38,366
Yeah. Sure.

528
00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:43,938
Why?

529
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,742
I needed the truth,
Sam.

530
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,311
I needed revenge
for my family.

531
00:36:50,313 --> 00:36:52,647
You would've done
the same thing.

532
00:36:57,253 --> 00:36:59,954
I'm sorry.

533
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,558
I'm sorry
I couldn't help you.

534
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,227
I'm sorry
I didn't know how.

535
00:37:06,229 --> 00:37:08,296
It's not about you,
Sam.

536
00:37:08,298 --> 00:37:10,465
It's never about <i>you.</i>

537
00:37:10,467 --> 00:37:14,602
You couldn't fix me 'cause
I don't want to be fixed.

538
00:37:14,604 --> 00:37:17,038
I was never broken.

539
00:37:17,941 --> 00:37:21,342
Yeah, Nick, you are.

540
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:24,278
I don't feel sorry
for you, Nick.

541
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,981
I feel sorry
for the people you hurt,

542
00:37:26,983 --> 00:37:28,850
the people you murdered,

543
00:37:28,852 --> 00:37:31,886
the people whose faces
will haunt you

544
00:37:31,888 --> 00:37:35,189
every night
for the rest of your life.

545
00:37:41,865 --> 00:37:44,265
You can burn.

546
00:37:52,675 --> 00:37:54,675
Mind your head.

547
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:01,482
I saw, Dean.

548
00:38:01,484 --> 00:38:02,917
Donna's shed.

549
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:08,589
I know what you've been
building, planning.

550
00:38:08,591 --> 00:38:10,691
And we are gonna
talk about that.

551
00:38:10,693 --> 00:38:14,929
We are all three of us
gonna talk about that.

552
00:38:14,931 --> 00:38:18,032
So if
you don't tell Sam...

553
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:21,402
I will.

554
00:38:28,044 --> 00:38:30,011
It's a Ma'lak box.

555
00:38:31,247 --> 00:38:33,414
Secured and warded.

556
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:34,982
Once inside...

557
00:38:34,984 --> 00:38:38,286
nothing gets out,
not even an archangel.

558
00:38:38,288 --> 00:38:39,887
Especially an archangel.

559
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:41,422
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I've -- I've read about these,

560
00:38:41,424 --> 00:38:42,857
but no --
but no one's ever --

561
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:44,659
They're impossible
to build.

562
00:38:44,661 --> 00:38:47,728
Yeah, well,
not so much.

563
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,031
That's your plan?

564
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:53,201
You want
to be buried alive?

565
00:38:53,203 --> 00:38:56,537
Buried's not safe enough.

566
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:59,040
Plan is,
pay a little hush money,

567
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:02,577
charter a boat to take me
out to the Pacific.

568
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,145
Splash.

569
00:39:05,548 --> 00:39:07,682
You and Michael,

570
00:39:07,684 --> 00:39:12,119
trapped together --
for eternity?

571
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:14,722
Yeah.

572
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:19,861
You do realize
how insane this is, right?

573
00:39:19,863 --> 00:39:23,030
It's the only sane play
I've got.

574
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,468
Michael gets out,
that's it for this world.

575
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,836
And he <i>will</i> get out.

576
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:31,005
Well, how do you know that
for sure?

577
00:39:31,007 --> 00:39:32,173
Because I do.

578
00:39:32,175 --> 00:39:35,042
Because I can feel him
in my head.

579
00:39:35,044 --> 00:39:37,912
That door is giving.
I can feel it giving.

580
00:39:37,914 --> 00:39:40,548
- But there has to be another way.
- There's not, okay?

581
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,083
There --

582
00:39:42,085 --> 00:39:43,985
Sam,
you've tried.

583
00:39:43,987 --> 00:39:46,320
Cass has tried.
Jack...

584
00:39:46,322 --> 00:39:48,723
And I love you
for trying.

585
00:39:50,293 --> 00:39:51,726
But none of it's
gonna work.

586
00:39:51,728 --> 00:39:53,995
- We don't know that.
- Yeah, we do.

587
00:39:53,997 --> 00:39:55,429
- What?
- Billie.

588
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:56,108
Billie?

589
00:39:56,132 --> 00:39:57,922
She paid me
a little visit.

590
00:39:59,402 --> 00:40:03,404
She said that there's only
one way that this ends right.

591
00:40:04,974 --> 00:40:06,440
And this is it --

592
00:40:06,442 --> 00:40:10,011
this, right here,
this box.

593
00:40:10,013 --> 00:40:12,680
So she gave up
the special recipe,

594
00:40:12,682 --> 00:40:14,815
and all I had to do
was the work.

595
00:40:14,817 --> 00:40:16,050
It's fate.

596
00:40:16,052 --> 00:40:18,853
Since when
do we believe in fate?

597
00:40:18,855 --> 00:40:20,388
Now, Sam.

598
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,223
Since now.

599
00:40:27,497 --> 00:40:29,330
So...

600
00:40:29,332 --> 00:40:34,135
you came out here
to see Donna,

601
00:40:34,137 --> 00:40:36,938
to see Mom on some --
some what?

602
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,207
Some sick,
secret farewell tour?

603
00:40:41,544 --> 00:40:43,511
You were gonna leave,

604
00:40:43,513 --> 00:40:47,081
and you weren't even
gonna tell me.

605
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,382
Me.

606
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:51,185
Do you realize
how messed up that is,

607
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:53,487
how unfair that is?
- I didn't have a choice!

608
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:56,357
Sam, you're the last person
I could tell,

609
00:40:56,359 --> 00:40:58,092
the last person
I could be around,

610
00:40:58,094 --> 00:41:01,095
'cause you're the only one that
could've talked me out of it.

611
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,701
And I won't be
talked out of it.

612
00:41:06,703 --> 00:41:08,269
I won't.

613
00:41:08,271 --> 00:41:11,105
I'm doing this.

614
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:15,810
Now, you can either
let me do it alone...

615
00:41:15,812 --> 00:41:17,979
or you could help me.

616
00:41:20,249 --> 00:41:23,384
But I'm doing this.

617
00:41:39,936 --> 00:41:42,370
All right.
