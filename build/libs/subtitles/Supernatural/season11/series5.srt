00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:16,054
When I was 6 months old,
my mom died,

705
00:37:16,056 --> 00:37:19,825
and my dad was...

706
00:37:19,827 --> 00:37:22,694
was never really
around much.

707
00:37:24,198 --> 00:37:28,366
I realize that's nowhere close
to what you've lost,

708
00:37:28,368 --> 00:37:31,737
but...you're gonna
survive this.

709
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:33,705
People are
gonna help you.

710
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,744
There's Aunt Kathy.

711
00:37:38,746 --> 00:37:41,613
She comes at Christmas.

712
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:54,960
First of all, I ripped my hand
out of the cuff.

713
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:57,361
Well, you saved us, Len.

714
00:37:57,364 --> 00:37:59,297
Yeah, that's not why
I mauled myself.

715
00:37:59,299 --> 00:38:02,234
I-I wanted to see
if I could do it.

716
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:05,437
It hurt like a mother,

717
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:08,140
but it didn't
wig me out at all.

718
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:11,743
I picked up my thumb like it was
a mini hot dog.

719
00:38:12,945 --> 00:38:14,945
Len, I'm not gonna lie.
That's worrisome.

720
00:38:14,948 --> 00:38:16,148
And that girl --

721
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:19,017
my brain said
I should help you,

722
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:22,387
but I-I didn't really feel
anything...

723
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:24,489
For you<i> or</i> her.

724
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:31,096
What kind of person can murder
and feel nothing?

725
00:38:32,765 --> 00:38:38,135
Len, whatever Darkness
you have inside you,

726
00:38:38,138 --> 00:38:41,106
if there's a shred
of conscience,

727
00:38:41,108 --> 00:38:43,141
then there might be hope.

728
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:46,077
No, Sam said
once your soul is gone,

729
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,247
you can't get it back,
and --

730
00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:53,485
and I-I know for sure now
if I'm not stopped,

731
00:38:53,487 --> 00:38:55,253
there'll be
another kill.

732
00:38:55,255 --> 00:38:58,356
I can feel it.

733
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:01,526
Like a bubble
rising up.

734
00:39:01,528 --> 00:39:05,497
So, what do you
want to do?

735
00:39:05,499 --> 00:39:08,700
You could kill me.

736
00:39:10,971 --> 00:39:12,737
No, I can't -- I...

737
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:15,006
No, I don't want
to do that.

738
00:39:16,243 --> 00:39:19,778
Then there's only
one thing.

739
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,013
I'm gonna turn myself in.

740
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,817
I'll confess
to all the murders.

741
00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:27,419
That way,
I can't get out.

742
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:30,288
Hmm.

743
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:32,791
Well,
there's not too many...

744
00:39:32,793 --> 00:39:35,560
soulless killers
that would give themselves up.

745
00:39:35,562 --> 00:39:39,564
I remember what it was like
to do the right thing.

746
00:39:39,566 --> 00:39:43,602
So I'm -- I'm going
through the motions

747
00:39:43,604 --> 00:39:47,038
for as long as I can.

748
00:39:52,178 --> 00:39:55,179
So, I can't believe Len
turned himself in.

749
00:39:56,984 --> 00:39:59,484
I mean, it kind of
makes sense, you know,

750
00:39:59,486 --> 00:40:02,721
people having different
reactions to losing their souls.

751
00:40:02,723 --> 00:40:04,389
I did.

752
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:06,691
Everyone's got their own
history, right?

753
00:40:06,692 --> 00:40:09,126
Len loses his heart.

754
00:40:09,129 --> 00:40:10,595
Sydney loses her head.

755
00:40:10,597 --> 00:40:12,564
What are we looking for,
the cowardly lion next?

756
00:40:17,104 --> 00:40:19,537
You know, I get this, like,
pit in my stomach

757
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:21,640
any time I think of her --

758
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:24,341
the Darkness --

759
00:40:24,344 --> 00:40:27,112
like, we only know the tip
of what she is,

760
00:40:27,114 --> 00:40:29,247
what she does to people.

761
00:40:29,248 --> 00:40:31,615
You know,
Len was freaked out by her,

762
00:40:31,618 --> 00:40:32,717
but Sydney --

763
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:34,552
Sydney couldn't
get enough.

764
00:40:34,554 --> 00:40:37,422
The...Bliss she was talking
about, you know?

765
00:40:39,526 --> 00:40:41,626
What was it like
for you?

766
00:40:41,628 --> 00:40:44,095
Did you feel like that
with Amara?

767
00:40:44,097 --> 00:40:45,864
No.

768
00:40:45,866 --> 00:40:49,067
No, I mean, it was quiet,

769
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:51,603
you know, till,
uh [Chuckles]

770
00:40:51,605 --> 00:40:53,171
Till she started
hatching killers

771
00:40:53,173 --> 00:40:56,341
and rallying monsters
to raise armies.

772
00:40:56,343 --> 00:40:58,910
So that's how we have
to find her, huh?

773
00:40:58,912 --> 00:41:00,111
Follow the bodies?

774
00:41:00,113 --> 00:41:01,813
You got a better idea?

775
00:41:01,815 --> 00:41:04,683
We could follow the crazy
you've been seeing.

776
00:41:04,685 --> 00:41:06,851
Look, at the rate
Amara's growing,

777
00:41:06,853 --> 00:41:09,220
sucking souls
and getting stronger,

778
00:41:09,222 --> 00:41:11,690
she might not be
that hard to find.

779
00:41:11,692 --> 00:41:13,425
Come on.

780
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:17,696
?

781
00:41:17,698 --> 00:41:19,864
[ Engine turns over ]

782
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,554
Bye, Dean.

783
00:41:42,556 --> 00:41:44,956
I'll see you soon.
