I don't suppose God's decided
to share any wisdom on the matter.

713
00:39:58,099 --> 00:39:59,431
I'll look into the lore.

714
00:39:59,433 --> 00:40:03,235

716
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:31,663
[ Thunder crashing ]

717
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:42,674
[ Breathing heavily ]

718
00:40:43,978 --> 00:40:47,813
? Girl ?

719
00:40:47,815 --> 00:40:52,418
? you'll be a woman soon ?

720
00:40:55,189 --> 00:40:57,222
? I love you so much,
can't count all the ways ?

721
00:40:57,224 --> 00:41:00,526
? I've died for you, girl,
and all they can say is ?

722
00:41:00,528 --> 00:41:03,729
? "he's not your kind" ?

723
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:05,798
? they never get tired
of putting me down ?

724

your mind ?
