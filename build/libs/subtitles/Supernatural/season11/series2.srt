1
00:00:01,604 --> 00:00:02,971
Getting rid of the Mark

2
00:00:02,973 --> 00:00:04,339
unleashed a force
on this world

3
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:06,508
that could destroy it.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,310
This is the Darkness, right?
It's got to be.

5
00:00:08,312 --> 00:00:10,378
She shows up and everybody goes
"28 Days Later"?

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,880
They were like rabid dogs.

7
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:13,381
They didn't stop.

8
00:00:13,383 --> 00:00:15,350
Maybe it was the smoke,
and anybody who was outside,

9
00:00:15,352 --> 00:00:16,918
they were exposed.

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,320
That wasn't human.
Why not? I killed death.

11
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:20,655
I'm pretty much open
for anything.

12
00:00:20,657 --> 00:00:22,924
Did they bleed on you?
They did.

13
00:00:22,926 --> 00:00:24,492
It might be transmittable.
I'll go.

14
00:00:24,494 --> 00:00:25,827
You saved
my baby girl.

15
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:28,330
Her name is Amara.

16
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:31,266
Look, we can just wait
for them to die.

17
00:00:31,268 --> 00:00:33,068
We can't save Cass if we're
stuck in some hospital.

18
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,337
I can't help myself.

19
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:37,238
He's still alive.

20
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,108
Brothers...
Save me from doing worse.

21
00:00:43,356 --> 00:00:44,589
All right, let's gear up.

22
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:48,159
Saving people means
all of the people.

23
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:49,594
What are you thinking?

24
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:51,396
Get Jenna and the baby
somewhere safe.

25
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:52,964
Without a shot.

26
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:55,533
Hey!

27
00:00:58,437 --> 00:01:00,071
Hey, you good?
Yeah.

28
00:01:00,073 --> 00:01:01,973
I'm gonna run Jenna up
to her grandmother's.

29
00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:03,341
How about you?
You okay?

30
00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:04,409
Like it or not,
I'm gonna find a cure.

31
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:06,211
Yeah, I know you are.

32
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:20,084
<i>H-a-t-e.</i>

33
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:23,021
<i>It was with this left hand</i>
<i>that old brother Cain</i>

34
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:25,657
<i>struck the blow that laid</i>
<i>his brother low.</i>

35
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:27,959
<i>L-o-v-e.</i>

36
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:29,727
<i>You see these fingers?</i>
<i>They're arched.</i>

37
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:31,095
<i>These fingers has veins</i>

38
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:33,131
<i>that run straight to the soul</i>
<i>of man.</i>

39
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:35,600
<i>The right hand, friends --</i>
<i>the hand of love.</i>

40
00:02:35,602 --> 00:02:38,469
<i>Now watch, and I'll show you</i>
<i>the story of life.</i>

41
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:40,138
<i>These fingers, dear hearts,</i>

42
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,373
<i>is always a-warrin'</i>
<i>and a-tuggin',</i>

43
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,841
<i>one against the other.</i>

44
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:45,143
<i>Now watch 'em.</i>

45
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:47,845
<i>Old brother left hand --</i>

46
00:02:47,847 --> 00:02:49,147
<i>left hand hates a-fightin'.</i>

47
00:02:49,149 --> 00:02:50,515
Can you talk?

48
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:51,950
<i>And it looks like</i>
<i>love's a goner.</i>

49
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:52,951
Or are you too far gone?

50
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:54,385
<i>But wait a minute.</i>
What?

51
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:55,787
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

52
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:57,021
<i>Hot dog!</i>
<i>Love's a-winnin'.</i>

53
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:00,158
<i>Yes, siree.</i>
<i>It's love that won.</i>

54
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,493
<i>And old left-hand hate</i>
<i>is down for the count.</i>

55
00:03:02,495 --> 00:03:03,928
Good answer.

58
00:03:28,722 --> 00:03:31,189
Well, nice neighborhood.

59
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:34,292
Yeah.
I pretty much grew up here.

60
00:03:34,294 --> 00:03:36,628
Learned to ride my bike
down the road.

61
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,530
Had my first kiss at that
blue house over there.

62
00:03:39,532 --> 00:03:41,499
Lost my virginity
up there.

63
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,701
I'll bet blue house
was pissed.

64
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:44,969
She was.

65
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:46,070
Do you mind?

66
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:47,505
Yeah.

67
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:50,842
Hey, beautiful.

68
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:53,878
Anyway...

69
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,314
That's why I asked you
to bring us here.

70
00:03:56,316 --> 00:03:59,384
After everything that happened,
it just feels safe.

71
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:02,153
Well, good.
Safe is good.

72
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:03,888
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

73
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,156
You're so great with her.

74
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:06,991
Well, what can I say?
Chicks dig me.

75
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:09,060
Well, look,
I should, uh...

76
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:11,062
Right. Sure.

77
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:16,234
You're gonna be okay,
both of you.

78
00:04:16,236 --> 00:04:19,237
I know.
What about you and Sam?

79
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,471
Are you gonna be okay?

80
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:22,340
Well, for us,
the bar's pretty low.

81
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:26,311
See you.

82
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:28,846
Dean.

83
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:30,448
Thank you...

84
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,550
For everything.

85
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,724
Jenna.

86
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:41,192
Hi, grandma.

87
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:51,903
After you called, they did
a big report on the news.

88
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:54,672
That weatherman I don't like
with the big teeth,

89
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:57,375
he said some kind of freak storm
hit Superior.

90
00:04:57,377 --> 00:04:59,043
Yeah.

91
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:00,978
It was...crazy.

92
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,380
Well, don't you worry.

93
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:03,881
If that thing
rolls our way,

94
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:06,017
I've got a generator
and enough canned green beans

95
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:07,585
to last
till Judgment Day.

96
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:08,786
Good to know.

97
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:12,190
And this must be Amara.

98
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:15,626
Oh.
What a little angel.

99
00:05:15,628 --> 00:05:17,428
Yeah.
She's a miracle.

100
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,064
And her folks?

101
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:28,740
It's a long story.

102
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:30,808
Well, then it can wait
till after your nap.

103
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,943
My what?

104
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:33,578
When's the last time
you slept?

105
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,347
Because -- and I mean this is
the nicest possible way --

106
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:38,049
you look like poop
on parade.

107
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:39,951
Now, I made up
the guest bedroom,

108
00:05:39,953 --> 00:05:42,520
and I got your father's old crib
out for the baby,

109
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:43,621
so I will put her down --

110
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:45,223
yes, I will --

111
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:47,859
while you go upstairs
and have a rest, all right?

112
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:51,829
Honestly, a nap sounds
awesome right now.

113
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:54,799
Well, then, you just go
right upstairs, Missy.

114
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:56,334
Thank you.

115
00:05:57,637 --> 00:05:58,870
Aww.

116
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:01,272
Who's the little angel, hmm?

117
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:03,841
You have to go to sleep.

118
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:06,110
Oh, who's a beautiful baby?

119
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:10,948
You are a beautiful,
beautiful baby.

120
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,919
There we go. Yeah.

121
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:17,822
Night-night, doodlebug.

122
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:27,853
What's your name?

123
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:30,456
Bite me.

124
00:07:33,693 --> 00:07:38,531
Okay, "bite me," how long have
you been infected?

125
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:42,234
Could ask you
the same thing.

126
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:44,303
We smell our own.

127
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:45,905
Answer the question.

128
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:47,940
Why?

129
00:07:47,942 --> 00:07:49,975
'Cause you want to know how much
time you got left?

130
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,646
I want to know everything.

131
00:07:53,648 --> 00:07:56,015
Uh-huh.

132
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,051
What's in it for me?

133
00:07:59,053 --> 00:08:01,687
Well,
if I can find a cure --

134
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,955
"If."

135
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:08,494
I want
something real...

136
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:14,133
...something I can hold
in my hands.

137
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:15,734
Like what?

138
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,841
Your pudding.

139
00:08:39,526 --> 00:08:42,127
I was infected last night.

140
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:43,863
You?

141
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:45,564
This morning.

142
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:49,001
Wait a second.
Then why --

143
00:08:49,003 --> 00:08:51,403
...am I further along?
Don't know.

144
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:55,007
This thing,
it ain't math.

145
00:08:55,009 --> 00:09:00,112
I seen some people change fast,
some change slow.

146
00:09:00,114 --> 00:09:02,915
But in the end...

147
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,417
We all end up the same.

148
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,720
We go psycho.

149
00:09:07,722 --> 00:09:09,855
And then we go boom.

150
00:09:13,593 --> 00:09:15,861
Well, that's not --

151
00:09:18,431 --> 00:09:23,669
I'm gonna fix this.

152
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:27,740
You and me,

153
00:09:27,742 --> 00:09:29,208
we're dead.

154
00:09:31,244 --> 00:09:34,413
We're just taking our sweet time
about it.

155
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:42,821
So if you were smart,
you'd put a bullet in me...

156
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:48,294
...and then eat one
yourself.

157
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,409
Come on, Cass.

158
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,747
Hmm.

159
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:10,616
"Dean."

160
00:10:10,618 --> 00:10:12,518
As in Winchester?

161
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,653
Probably.

162
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:17,323
Do the honors.

163
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,131
Morning, handsome!

164
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:27,967
Efram.

165
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:30,202
Jonah.

166
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:32,371
What's --
what's happening?

167
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:35,274
We have questions for you,
Castiel.

168
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:37,576
Why am I...

169
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:39,144
I asked for help.

170
00:10:39,146 --> 00:10:42,915
And I asked for a vessel
that didn't have psoriasis.

171
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:45,484
Crap happens.

172
00:10:45,486 --> 00:10:47,886
No.

173
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:49,989
No what?

174
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:52,591
No.

175
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:55,060
You don't understand.
I'm cursed.

176
00:10:55,062 --> 00:10:57,496
You should run.

177
00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:23,822
Did you hear that?

178
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:25,457
Sounded like raccoon--

179
00:11:27,128 --> 00:11:29,495
That was not a raccoon.

180
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:07,270
Mary, mother --
no, Jenna, don't!

181
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:12,542
Jenna, no!
The devil's in that girl!

182
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:13,743
What?

183
00:12:13,745 --> 00:12:14,744
I'm calling Father Wyatt.

184
00:12:14,746 --> 00:12:16,179
Grandma, no.

185
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:18,215
Well,
who are we gonna call?

186
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:19,983
Ghostbusters.

187
00:12:19,985 --> 00:12:22,319
Jenna, hey.
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

188
00:12:22,321 --> 00:12:23,386
Slow down.

189
00:12:23,388 --> 00:12:24,688
What's wrong?

190
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:40,637
I mean, it sounds like something
out of "The Exorcist."

191
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,771
That's what I said.

192
00:12:41,773 --> 00:12:43,006
So you thinking demon?

193
00:12:43,008 --> 00:12:45,075
Or kid got infected
by something.

194
00:12:45,077 --> 00:12:48,111
You know, who knows what was
in that giant, crazy fart?

195
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:52,015
Wow. Vivid. Thanks.

196
00:12:52,017 --> 00:12:54,084
Look, man,
I know you're flying solo.

197
00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:55,352
No, I'm -- I'm fine, Dean.

198
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:57,187
Look, don't --
don't worry about me.

199
00:12:57,189 --> 00:12:59,956
Just help Jenna.
No, I'm -- I'm fine, Dean.

200
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,658
And if you need anything,

201
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,059
then call me.

202
00:13:03,061 --> 00:13:05,228
Will do. How you doing?
How's "Zombieland"?

203
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:09,699
It's good.

204
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:11,334
It's great.

205
00:13:16,173 --> 00:13:18,275
Where's Metatron?

206
00:13:20,946 --> 00:13:23,413
I don't know.

207
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:30,253
Where's Metatron, Castiel?

208
00:13:30,255 --> 00:13:31,821
Mercy, brother, please!

209
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:34,758
Brother? Ha!

210
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:39,329
What are you?

211
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:42,032
W-what?

212
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:44,601
I'm an angel of the Lord.

213
00:13:44,603 --> 00:13:46,736
That so?

214
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:49,205
'Cause,
near as I can tell,

215
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:54,144
when you have to choose between
heaven and the Winchesters...

216
00:13:54,146 --> 00:13:55,178
You choose them.

217
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,980
Every time.

218
00:13:58,283 --> 00:14:00,817
So, see,
you're not my brother.

219
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:05,622
And if I had it my way,
I'd take this blade,

220
00:14:05,624 --> 00:14:07,824
stick it in your heart...

221
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:13,029
...and call that
a damn good day.

222
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:16,866
Then do it.

223
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:26,376
Nah.

224
00:14:26,378 --> 00:14:28,612
The fun's just
getting started.

225
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:33,550
No.

226
00:14:39,858 --> 00:14:44,661
? o death ?

227
00:14:44,663 --> 00:14:48,331
? o death ?

228
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:52,402
? o death ?

229
00:14:52,404 --> 00:14:58,504
? won't you spare me
over another year? ?

230
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,314
? Oh, what is this
that I can't see ?

231
00:15:04,316 --> 00:15:10,387
? with ice-cold hands
taking hold of me? ?

232
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,330
? When God is gone
and the devil takes hold ?

233
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:25,969
? who'll have mercy
on your soul? ?

234
00:15:32,276 --> 00:15:34,277
Hey, Sam.

235
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:37,113
How do you know my name?

236
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:39,582
Who are you?

237
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:40,984
Mm.

238
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:43,987
Think you mean "what?"

239
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:46,923
Here's a hint.

240
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:50,393
You and your brother been
real good for business lately.

241
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,230
You're a Reaper.

242
00:15:54,232 --> 00:15:56,499
The circle
gets the square.

243
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:58,635
What's your name?

244
00:15:58,637 --> 00:16:01,304
Mm, you flirtin'
with me, kid?

245
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:05,341
'Cause, no offense,
but you ain't my type.

246
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:07,377
And I'm not looking
to get friendly

247
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:09,713
with the man who helped gut
my boss.

248
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:14,451
I'm sorry about death.

249
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:17,053
So am I.

250
00:16:17,055 --> 00:16:19,022
But people
are still dying,

251
00:16:19,024 --> 00:16:23,293
so...work to do,
souls to collect...

252
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,829
Messages to deliver.

253
00:16:27,264 --> 00:16:29,532
What kind of messages?

254
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:32,469
It's over.

255
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:35,638
What's over?

256
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,273
You and Dean...

257
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:43,613
Dying and coming back
again and again.

258
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:46,750
The old death
thought it was funny.

259
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:51,154
But now there's one hard, fast
rule in this universe.

260
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:55,091
What lives...dies.

261
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:58,661
So the next time
you or your brother bite it,

262
00:16:58,663 --> 00:17:01,931
well, you're not going
to heaven...

263
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,867
Or hell.

264
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:08,505
One of us --
and, Lord, I hope it's me --

265
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:10,206
we're gonna make
a mistake

266
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,542
and toss you out
into the Empty.

267
00:17:14,478 --> 00:17:18,915
And nothing comes back
from that.

268
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:28,758
I know you're dying.

269
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:32,996
I can feel it.

270
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:37,634
You're unclean
in the biblical sense.

271
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:48,211
So I'll be seeing you
again, Sam...

272
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:51,047
Seeing you real soon.

273
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:56,052
Name's Billie,
by the way.

274
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:02,725
Again, Metatron --
where is he?

275
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:04,494
I don't know.

276
00:18:04,496 --> 00:18:05,795
But you broke him
out of heaven.

277
00:18:05,797 --> 00:18:07,664
Yes.
And took his Grace.

278
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,632
Yes.

279
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:11,434
And you expect us
to believe he, what,

280
00:18:11,436 --> 00:18:14,504
just gave you the slip --
no powers, no wings?

281
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:17,106
Metatron tricked me.

282
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:18,541
So you're just stupid.

283
00:18:18,543 --> 00:18:19,542
Or he's lying.

284
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:21,044
Or that.

285
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:22,812
One way to find out.

286
00:18:25,216 --> 00:18:28,218
What should we
cut off first?

287
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:34,057
Eeny?

288
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:35,391
Meeny?

289
00:18:36,594 --> 00:18:39,495
Miny?

290
00:18:40,998 --> 00:18:43,099
Or Moe?

291
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,246
That's enough.

292
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:59,082
Hannah.

293
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:01,517
What are you doing?

294
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:03,519
Getting answers.

295
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:06,456
No.

296
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,424
This isn't
how we do things.

297
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:11,027
Get out.

298
00:19:13,764 --> 00:19:16,232
Out!

299
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:27,777
Thank you.

300
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:30,280
Don't thank me yet.

301
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:34,050
Something's happened, Castiel --
something horrible.

302
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:23,633
So...

303
00:20:23,635 --> 00:20:26,836
I know it's been
a long time, but...

304
00:20:30,342 --> 00:20:34,644
Dean and I, we've -- we've been
through a lot of bad.

305
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:37,680
But this is different.

306
00:20:37,682 --> 00:20:41,818
This is my fault, and I don't
know how to fix it.

307
00:20:43,854 --> 00:20:45,788
And if I have to die,

308
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,225
I've made my peace
with that, but...

309
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:50,994
Please.

310
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:53,963
Dean deserves better.

311
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,837
Dean deserves a life.

312
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:07,210
There are people out there,
good people,

313
00:21:07,212 --> 00:21:11,781
who are going to suffer
because of me,

314
00:21:11,783 --> 00:21:15,585
and I am not asking you
to clean up my mess.

315
00:21:15,587 --> 00:21:19,255
Hell, I don't even know
if you're out there, but...

316
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:22,458
If you are...

317
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,497
And if you can hear me,
I, um...

318
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:31,367
We need your help, God.

319
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:34,704
We need to know
there's hope.

320
00:21:34,706 --> 00:21:37,073
We need a sign.

321
00:22:08,405 --> 00:22:11,741
What does that mean?!

322
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,984
Hey.

323
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:23,386
Where's the kid?

324
00:22:23,388 --> 00:22:25,488
We got another problem.

325
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,956
Figures.

326
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,324
I tried to stop her,

327
00:22:28,326 --> 00:22:30,460
but my grandma's
real Catholic,

328
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:32,695
and after the crazy,
she called her priest,

329
00:22:32,697 --> 00:22:35,264
who sent over
an exorcist.

330
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:36,999
Really?

331
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:38,134
Yeah.

332
00:22:51,315 --> 00:22:53,749
Hello, my son.

333
00:23:03,484 --> 00:23:04,484
Crowley.

334
00:23:05,032 --> 00:23:06,565
<i>Father</i> Crowley.

335
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:08,567
Do you know each other?

336
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:10,035
Oh, yes.

337
00:23:10,037 --> 00:23:14,139
Dean was a rather scrumptious
young altar boy.

338
00:23:16,976 --> 00:23:21,246
Can I talk to you
outside...Father?

339
00:23:21,248 --> 00:23:22,881
Of course.

340
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:26,285
After I finish my tea.

341
00:23:39,232 --> 00:23:40,999
No.

342
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:43,568
This is safer.

343
00:23:54,848 --> 00:23:57,182
I wasn't lying
about Metatron.

344
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,318
I know.

345
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,220
But right now,
I'm more worried about you.

346
00:24:03,523 --> 00:24:05,324
Can you heal me?

347
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:14,433
I can't.

348
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:15,734
I'm sorry.

349
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:18,704
This --
it's...powerful magic.

350
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:24,176
Really? Father Crowley?
Really?

351
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:26,778
I'm sorry, aging, pathetic,
has-been rock star.

352
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,015
Did I offend your delicate
sensibilities?

353
00:24:30,017 --> 00:24:31,550
Where have you been?

354
00:24:31,552 --> 00:24:33,185
Your brother
and that idiot angel,

355
00:24:33,187 --> 00:24:34,886
do you know what
they've been doing?

356
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:36,488
I've heard.
Everything?

357
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,623
Enough.
What are you doing here?

358
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:41,193
Same as you --
I'm working the case.

359
00:24:41,195 --> 00:24:45,297
I feel the spell just cutting
deeper and deeper,

360
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:47,099
and I'm trying
to fight it.

361
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:48,200
I'm trying, but --

362
00:24:48,202 --> 00:24:49,534
does it have anything to do

363
00:24:49,536 --> 00:24:51,336
with the disturbance
in Superior, Nebraska?

364
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:56,508
You know about that?

365
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,910
Alarms have been sounding
in heaven, Castiel --

366
00:24:58,912 --> 00:25:03,115
alarms that haven't gone off
in...ever.

367
00:25:03,117 --> 00:25:05,617
We don't even know
what they mean.

368
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:08,787
Those alarms
are for the Darkness.

369
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:17,963
The Darkness is a story.

370
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:21,566
No, it's not.
It's real.

371
00:25:25,405 --> 00:25:26,905
The Darkness...

372
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:30,275
It's been locked away
since the dawn of creation.

373
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:34,379
And now it's free.

374
00:25:34,381 --> 00:25:37,549
Whatever's wrong,
Dean will fix it.

375
00:25:37,551 --> 00:25:39,151
God help us.

376
00:25:39,153 --> 00:25:42,354
I wouldn't count on that.

377
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:47,759
Yeah, it's okay.

378
00:25:49,662 --> 00:25:51,663
Where is it?

379
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:53,565
I don't know.

380
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:56,768
Then who would?
The Winchesters?

381
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:03,041
Castiel, if this is true,
it's the end for all of us.

382
00:26:03,043 --> 00:26:07,879
Sam and Dean --
where are they?

383
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:09,781
I don't know.

384
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:11,082
Then think harder!

385
00:26:11,084 --> 00:26:14,619
How did you find me?

386
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:18,323
I have sources
in the Catholic church --

387
00:26:18,325 --> 00:26:21,092
nuns that owe me a favor,

388
00:26:21,094 --> 00:26:22,661
priests with a taste
for --

389
00:26:22,663 --> 00:26:24,796
okay, all right, yeah,
I can imagine.

390
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,500
You really can't.

391
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:31,670
Anyhow, they hear of a demonic
possession, they call me.

392
00:26:31,672 --> 00:26:34,339
If it's one of mine,
I tell them to ignore it.

393
00:26:34,341 --> 00:26:36,374
If it's a, uh,
demon gone rogue,

394
00:26:36,376 --> 00:26:40,045
well, that's when Father Crowley
comes out to play.

395
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:42,948
So you think there's a demon
in there.

396
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,016
Not even a little bit.

397
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:04,870
I saved you.

398
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:07,772
No.
I don't think you did.

399
00:27:07,774 --> 00:27:14,179
I think that you told Efram
and Jonah to bring me here

400
00:27:14,181 --> 00:27:15,380
and to hurt me,

401
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:18,517
and so you arranged
to -- to...

402
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:22,854
...to burst in and save me.

403
00:27:22,856 --> 00:27:25,690
You were hoping that
I would be so grateful

404
00:27:25,692 --> 00:27:28,126
that I would do anything
you said,

405
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,830
that I would tell you anything
that you wanted to know.

406
00:27:37,571 --> 00:27:39,905
Why, Hannah?

407
00:27:39,907 --> 00:27:42,173
We were friends.

408
00:27:42,175 --> 00:27:47,145
That was before you
freed Metatron...

409
00:27:47,147 --> 00:27:49,014
Before...

410
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:53,885
The other angels,
they hate you.

411
00:27:53,887 --> 00:27:58,223
And what about you?
Do you hate me?

412
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,295
It doesn't matter.

413
00:28:04,865 --> 00:28:08,600
We took a vote --
democracy in action --

414
00:28:08,602 --> 00:28:12,537
and...
Hannah's doing the job.

415
00:28:14,407 --> 00:28:18,443
I won't give you
Sam and Dean.

416
00:28:19,412 --> 00:28:20,845
Sure you will.

417
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:23,582
We're gonna hack
your brain.

418
00:28:28,988 --> 00:28:31,156
Whatever's in that house,

419
00:28:31,158 --> 00:28:35,660
I can taste the power
radiating from it.

420
00:28:35,662 --> 00:28:37,429
Oh, Jenna!

421
00:28:37,431 --> 00:28:40,098
Oh! You scared me.

422
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,766
That thing...

423
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:45,103
It's old...

424
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:47,505
What'd you do,
drop a bowling ball up there?

425
00:28:47,507 --> 00:28:49,307
...deep...

426
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:51,109
Jenna?

427
00:28:54,781 --> 00:28:57,282
...dark.

428
00:28:57,284 --> 00:29:00,185
Honey, are you all right?

429
00:29:00,187 --> 00:29:02,787
I always wanted
to try this.

430
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:08,126
No.

431
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,231
Jenna?

432
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:14,899
Jenna!

433
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:22,307
Well, hello, plot twist.

434
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:27,512
Anything?

435
00:29:27,514 --> 00:29:28,713
Not yet.

436
00:29:28,715 --> 00:29:30,949
You said you knew how
to do this.

437
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:34,653
I watched Naomi...
Once.

438
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,657
Enough!

439
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,625
Look, you don't want to get
your pretty hands dirty, fine.

440
00:29:40,627 --> 00:29:42,560
Walk away.
But this is happening. Gimme.

441
00:29:44,664 --> 00:29:46,898
Now hold still.

442
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,566
This one might hurt.

443
00:29:48,568 --> 00:29:49,534
I said stop.

444
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:52,804
You get in my way again...

445
00:29:54,007 --> 00:29:57,175
You touch me again,
and I...

446
00:29:57,177 --> 00:29:57,876
Ohh!

447
00:29:58,845 --> 00:29:59,845
...will...

448
00:30:01,447 --> 00:30:02,914
...end you!

449
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:05,083
Uh, Efram.

450
00:30:21,635 --> 00:30:22,734
Castiel.

451
00:30:22,736 --> 00:30:24,169
No!

452
00:30:44,023 --> 00:30:45,056
Aah!

453
00:31:00,306 --> 00:31:01,973
No.

454
00:31:06,345 --> 00:31:08,747
No.

455
00:31:31,778 --> 00:31:34,478
<i>Sam, Sam.</i>

456
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,614
<i>Sam. Sam.</i>

457
00:31:36,616 --> 00:31:38,282
You're fine.

458
00:31:38,284 --> 00:31:40,551
You're fine, you're fine,
you're fine, you're fine.

459
00:31:40,553 --> 00:31:44,655
You're unclean
in the biblical sense.

460
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:39,276
<i>Don't!</i>

461
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:42,546
<i>Don't do this to yourself.</i>
<i>Don't do this to yourself.</i>

462
00:32:42,548 --> 00:32:46,817
<i>I'll die.</i>

463
00:32:46,819 --> 00:32:48,886
<i>Please, stop.</i>

464
00:32:48,888 --> 00:32:51,255
<i>I can't.</i>

465
00:32:51,257 --> 00:32:53,491
<i>Don't do this to yourself.</i>

466
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:56,694
<i>Please, stop.</i>

467
00:33:18,683 --> 00:33:19,950
Jen!

468
00:33:19,952 --> 00:33:20,851
Jenna!

469
00:33:20,853 --> 00:33:23,120
Really?
What?

470
00:33:23,122 --> 00:33:26,290
We have no idea what ancient,
world-shattering evil

471
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:28,425
we're dealing with,
but go right ahead.

472
00:33:28,427 --> 00:33:30,194
Let him know
we're coming!

473
00:33:30,196 --> 00:33:33,864
Listen, Velma, this isn't
the Scooby gang, okay?

474
00:33:33,866 --> 00:33:35,566
So either shut up
or get out.

475
00:33:35,568 --> 00:33:37,535
Easy, tiger.
Just trying to help.

476
00:33:40,807 --> 00:33:43,541
I'm way more of a Daphne.

477
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,784
Hey.

478
00:34:09,502 --> 00:34:13,103
We're bound, Dean.

479
00:34:13,105 --> 00:34:14,538
We'll always be bound.

480
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,274
We will always help
each other.

481
00:34:18,945 --> 00:34:20,678
The child likes you.

482
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,181
No surprise, really.

483
00:34:24,183 --> 00:34:25,916
You're very maternal.

484
00:34:32,124 --> 00:34:35,025
We got to find Jenna.

485
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,804
? <i>There's a crazy little shack</i>
<i>beyond the tracks</i> ?

486
00:34:49,007 --> 00:34:54,011
? <i>and everybody calls it</i>
<i>the sugar shack</i> ?

487
00:34:55,714 --> 00:35:00,084
? <i>well, it's just a coffeehouse</i>
<i>and it's made out of wood</i> ?

488
00:35:00,086 --> 00:35:03,988
? <i>Espresso coffee</i>
<i>tastes mighty good</i> ?

489
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:07,024
? <i>that's not the reason</i>
<i>why I've got to get back</i> ?

490
00:35:07,026 --> 00:35:10,060
? <i>to that sugar shack</i> ?

491
00:35:13,899 --> 00:35:16,533
Ohh. Whoa.

492
00:35:20,338 --> 00:35:21,472
What...

493
00:35:21,474 --> 00:35:22,840
Aah!

494
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:52,956
Hey.

495
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:56,326
Thank you.

496
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:00,427
Let's go save
the rest of them.

497
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:06,533
Drama.

498
00:36:16,644 --> 00:36:18,211
Jenna?

499
00:36:18,213 --> 00:36:19,779
What are you doing?

500
00:36:19,781 --> 00:36:22,019
My grandma collected
these things,

501
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,888
but I always thought
they were so...Blah.

502
00:36:30,428 --> 00:36:32,729
Don't worry.
She won't care.

503
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:34,230
I cut her throat.

504
00:36:34,232 --> 00:36:37,033
Why did you do that?

505
00:36:37,035 --> 00:36:40,203
Because this woman
doesn't have a soul.

506
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:45,542
Fascinating.

507
00:36:45,544 --> 00:36:47,510
What are you talking about?
How is that even possible?

508
00:36:47,512 --> 00:36:48,945
Amara's hungry.

509
00:36:48,947 --> 00:36:50,513
She's a growing girl.

510
00:36:59,056 --> 00:37:02,559
Jenna.
Listen to me.

511
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:04,995
Whatever's happened,
whatever's going on,

512
00:37:04,997 --> 00:37:06,763
we can fix it, okay?

513
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:09,165
But I don't want
to be fixed.

514
00:37:12,837 --> 00:37:14,504
I like the new me.

515
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:15,638
She's a ball.

516
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,440
Just come with us, okay?

517
00:37:23,848 --> 00:37:25,782
Jenna! Stop!

518
00:37:44,935 --> 00:37:46,970
I was getting bored.

519
00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:53,510
You killed her!

520
00:37:53,512 --> 00:37:55,445
You're welcome.

521
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:56,613
Where are you going?

522
00:37:56,615 --> 00:38:00,016
To see the child
that eats souls.

523
00:38:00,018 --> 00:38:03,053
You don't get
what that thing is.

524
00:38:03,055 --> 00:38:05,088
Enlighten me.

525
00:38:06,957 --> 00:38:09,659
Come on, darling.
Don't play coy.

526
00:38:11,996 --> 00:38:14,931
I think Amara
is the Darkness.

527
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:17,000
Interesting.

528
00:38:17,002 --> 00:38:19,135
So, what now?

529
00:38:19,137 --> 00:38:21,971
You kill her? You?

530
00:38:21,973 --> 00:38:25,008
I don't have a choice.

531
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,309
Please.

532
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:27,577
Even if you could
murder a baby,

533
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:29,079
you couldn't murder
<i>that</i> baby.

534
00:38:29,081 --> 00:38:30,613
I saw the way
you looked at her.

535
00:38:30,615 --> 00:38:33,316
Me, on the other hand,

536
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:34,788
it's not like
it'd be my first.

537
00:38:34,796 --> 00:38:35,646
Oh, is that an offer?

538
00:38:35,653 --> 00:38:37,653
It's a promise -- right after
I'm done with her.

539
00:38:38,256 --> 00:38:39,656
Stay away from her!

540
00:38:43,427 --> 00:38:45,495
Oh, Dean.

541
00:38:45,497 --> 00:38:47,697
Adorable little Dean.

542
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:51,935
I want that child,
and I get what I want.

543
00:38:51,937 --> 00:38:55,338
You and Sam
don't understand.

544
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,875
I'm not
your bloody sidekick!

545
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:05,348
We've had some good times.

546
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:08,952
So I'm gonna give you
one chance --

547
00:39:08,954 --> 00:39:11,955
just one --
to walk out that door,

548
00:39:11,957 --> 00:39:16,359
or I'm gonna take you apart
atom by atom.

549
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:17,727
Do you understa--

550
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:21,231
Aah!

551
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,233
Bastard!

552
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:14,928
All right,
I still don't understand.

553
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:18,065
I mean, I thought the darkness
was a woman, not a child.

554
00:40:18,067 --> 00:40:20,300
Well, same here.

555
00:40:20,302 --> 00:40:23,771
I don't know. Maybe
whatever I saw wasn't real.

556
00:40:23,773 --> 00:40:25,606
Maybe it was a vision.

557
00:40:25,608 --> 00:40:28,409
Vision?
Yeah.

558
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,681
Huh.

559
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:36,283
Pretty weird.

560
00:40:36,285 --> 00:40:39,453
Yeah, weird with a weird cherry
on a weird top.

561
00:40:39,455 --> 00:40:41,789
We got to get maid.

562
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:45,793
But, you know,
one with a-a little uniform

563
00:40:45,795 --> 00:40:46,994
and really big, uh --

564
00:41:05,614 --> 00:41:08,415
Help me.

565
00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:32,773
My, haven't you grown
into a sweet younghing?

566
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,915
Want some candy,
little girl?

567
00:41:55,241 --> 00:42:01,741
