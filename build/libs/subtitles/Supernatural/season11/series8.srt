1
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:04,432
Don't be afraid of the
dark? What, are you kidding me?

2
00:00:04,434 --> 00:00:06,101
Of course you should
be afraid of the dark.

3
00:00:06,103 --> 00:00:07,903
- You know what's out there.
- It was the tooth fairy.

4
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:09,471
A leprechaun.
Why did it have to be clowns?

5
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:11,373
I'd say you have a bunch
of elves working for ya.

6
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:12,507
Fairies? Come on.

7
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,009
This is cupid?
? heaven ?

8
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:16,945
It was a little glowing hot...
Nipples?

9
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:19,347
- ...naked lady.
- Well, that's super disturbing.

10
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:21,750
I've never seen a baby monster before.
Aah!

11
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:23,852
Hi!

12
00:00:23,854 --> 00:00:25,921
Why is it so hard to believe
that God could

13
00:00:25,923 --> 00:00:27,789
be sending me visions about
the Darkness?

14
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,090
What are you trying to say?

15
00:00:29,092 --> 00:00:31,526
Don't count on God.
Okay? Count on us.

16
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:33,795
If it<i> is</i> God, then he's
showing me something

17
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:36,531
I don't know what
to do with -- the cage.

18
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:39,200
<i>Lucifer's</i> cage?
Yeah.

19
00:00:39,202 --> 00:00:42,003
What if he's telling me
I have to go back?

20
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:49,177
?

21
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:57,651
Here you go.

22
00:00:57,653 --> 00:01:00,354
One spoonful of sugar
or two?

23
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:13,267
Maddie, daddy and I are ready
to go to dinner now.

24
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:16,603
So whenever you're ready,
you just let us know.

25
00:01:16,605 --> 00:01:18,672
Sparkle and me
aren't done with tea, mommy.

26
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,377
Well...When you're ready.

27
00:01:27,283 --> 00:01:29,950
We have reservations.

28
00:01:29,952 --> 00:01:32,286
The R.I.E. manual says
be patient.

29
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:33,821
So now we wait for her
to have fake tea

30
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:36,557
with her fake
imaginary friend?

31
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:38,792
Perfect.

32
00:01:42,732 --> 00:01:44,832
We can party forever

33
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:48,035
while mommy and daddy
eat Cheerios for dinner.

34
00:01:56,412 --> 00:01:58,012
It's cool, Maddie.

35
00:01:58,014 --> 00:02:00,614
Go with your mom and dad.
I'll clean up.

36
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:07,087
I love you, Sparkle.

37
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,245
Mm.

38
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,416
Hiya, Maddie!

39
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:39,420
You're not mad--

40
00:02:41,524 --> 00:02:44,792
Don't forget to
brush your teeth, sweetie.

41
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:47,728
Sparkle!

42
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:54,399

Surprise!

45
00:04:17,453 --> 00:04:19,319
Uhh!
Who are you?!

46
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:20,854
It's me, Sam!

47
00:04:20,856 --> 00:04:22,222
It's Sully!

48
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:23,657
What?

49
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:24,958
You remember me, right?

50
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,061
I-I made all
your favorite snacks.

51
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:30,297
We were friends.
Like, best friends.

52
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:32,766
You remember?

53
00:04:34,336 --> 00:04:36,303
Sully.
Yeah.

54
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:37,738
No. You're not real.

55
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,941
Well, how'd you punch me...
Then?

56
00:04:42,878 --> 00:04:44,678
This can't be happening.

57
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,413
Dude.

58
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:48,148
Who you talking to?

59
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,850
Him.

60
00:04:52,655 --> 00:04:54,588
Are you having a stroke?

61
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,323
Do you smell toast?

62
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:59,693
He can't see me
unless I want him to.

63
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:01,128
What is all of this crap?

64
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,096
When'd you start eating
this stuff?

65
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:05,032
Is that marshmallows
on nachos?

66
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:08,468
This wasn't me.

67
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:12,539
It was me.

68
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,808
And those are delicious.

69
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,412
Wait a second.
C-can you see him?

70
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:20,781
Uh-huh.

71
00:05:20,783 --> 00:05:22,516
Dean, this, um...

72
00:05:22,518 --> 00:05:25,819
I think this is...Sully,

73
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:28,388
m-my friend from when
I was a kid.

74
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:31,525
You mean Mork from Ork here

75
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:34,428
is your dumbass
imaginary friend Sully?

76
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,762
Yeah.

77
00:05:35,764 --> 00:05:37,798
Uh, I'm not dumb or ass.

78
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,166
I'm gonna get my gun.

79
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:41,802
No, please.

80
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:43,537
Someone killed my friend.

81
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,474
You mean your imaginary
imaginary friend?

82
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:49,943
First off, “imaginary friend”
is more of a descriptive term.

83
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:53,814
How you just said it?
That was a little...offensive,

84
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:55,449
just to be honest.

85
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:57,284
Secondly, we're Zanna.

86
00:05:57,286 --> 00:05:59,052
Me and...

87
00:05:59,054 --> 00:06:00,721
Me and the victim were Zanna.

88
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:06,393
We help kids.
We're the good guys.

89
00:06:06,395 --> 00:06:08,028
Sam, tell him.

90
00:06:09,732 --> 00:06:13,033
Yeah, okay. Um...

91
00:06:14,603 --> 00:06:16,069
You know what? I'm still trying
to wrap my head around

92
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:17,871
this whole
you being real thing.

93
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:21,275
Aw! Yeah, no, no, of course.
No, that's okay. That's okay.

94
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:23,076
This is all really unexpected.

95
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:25,112
Yeah, that's one word
for it.

96
00:06:25,114 --> 00:06:28,482
Just...I need your help.

97
00:06:28,484 --> 00:06:31,285
All right, you're hunters.
That's what you do, right?

98
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:33,020
I mean, you help people, too.

99
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:35,422
Yeah. Yeah,<i> people.</i>

100
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:37,157
You are not that.

101
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,959
Dean, come on.

102
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:40,961
Come on?
Are you kidding -- look...

103
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:44,665
This -- mother--

104
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:49,102
you and me, library, right now.

105
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:50,971
Come on!

106
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:57,878
Ah!
Aah!

107
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,446
Yeah.
No, I'll just stay here.

108
00:06:59,448 --> 00:07:01,181
Coolio.

109
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:07,287
You're not actually
buying this crap, are you?

110
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:09,022
Dean,
when I was 9 years old,

111
00:07:09,024 --> 00:07:11,491
you know what I wanted
more than anything?

112
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:12,959
Marshmallow nachos.

113
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:14,961
Yeah, you were
a weird-ass kid.

114
00:07:14,963 --> 00:07:17,631
Yeah, well...

115
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,499
The only person
I ever told about it...

116
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:22,536
Sully.
Yes.

117
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:24,271
I don't know, man. I --

118
00:07:24,273 --> 00:07:26,807
hey, you know, maybe this is
just one of your visions.

119
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:28,275
Yeah, except we're both
seeing it.

120
00:07:28,277 --> 00:07:31,578
And it doesn't involve
the cage or Lucifer

121
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,481
or me having to talk
to Lucifer in the cage.

122
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:36,416
Look at this. Here.

123
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,354
In Romanian lore,
Zanna are creatures

124
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:42,556
who guide and protect
lost children.

125
00:07:42,558 --> 00:07:44,658
Zanna intentionally appear

126
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,992
as figments of
a child's imagination,

127
00:07:45,994 --> 00:07:47,594
allowing the child
to move on with confidence

128
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:50,163
once guidance
is no longer necessary.

129
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:51,832
Maybe Sully's
telling the truth.

130
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:54,434
Okay, say Bozo is legit.
Right?

131
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:57,871
Which, you know...
Hello, crazytown, but okay.

132
00:07:57,873 --> 00:08:00,574
How is this our problem?
Because someone's dead.

133
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:02,542
No,<i> something</i> is dead.

134
00:08:02,544 --> 00:08:05,145
A fairy Godmother getting
capped? That ain't our beat.

135
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:07,481
Yes, I know that, Dean, but --
but what?

136
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:12,052
But as messed up
and insane as this sounds...

137
00:08:12,054 --> 00:08:15,255
Sully helped me.

138
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,993
That's the place.

139
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:22,696
It's a horror show in there.

140
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:25,298
You mean, you've been inside?

141
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,200
Last night.

142
00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:31,438
I'm in management now,

143
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,341
so I don't get out
in the field much.

144
00:08:34,343 --> 00:08:37,244
I just came to see Sparkle.

145
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:39,679
Sp-- Sparkle?

146
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:41,114
Yeah.

147
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:43,316
Oh, I show up and...

148
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:45,986
I mean, the place was<i> bananas.</i>

149
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:48,021
Kid had called the cops,
mom's freaking out,

150
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:50,891
and...Sparkle...

151
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:55,595
Sam, it was horrible.

152
00:08:55,597 --> 00:08:57,631
Okay, so according to
Zanna rules,

153
00:08:57,633 --> 00:09:00,066
the kid is the only witness,
right?

154
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:02,536
Yeah.

155
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:04,905
Oh, poor thing.

156
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:07,607
I'll meet you inside.

157
00:09:12,147 --> 00:09:13,814
All right,
what are you thinkin'?

158
00:09:20,122 --> 00:09:24,324
Good. The Bert and Ernie
pretext. Awesome.

159
00:09:24,326 --> 00:09:27,060
Dude, you didn't have to come.

160
00:09:27,062 --> 00:09:28,862
You know, this whole
imaginary friend thing

161
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:30,330
was dumb then
and it's dumb now.

162
00:09:30,332 --> 00:09:32,265
Yeah, you've made that
pretty clear.

163
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,967
You didn't think to tell me
that he was real?

164
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:36,670
Well, Dean,
I didn't think he<i> was.</i>

165
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:38,271
And you saw
the lore book, too.

166
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:40,207
I mean, maybe when I was
9 years old

167
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:42,442
I thought he was real,
but I grew up.

168
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:44,069
Or grew out of it.

169
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,789
Whatever. I left it.

170
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,133
And what did you need
drop dead Fred for

171
00:09:46,134 --> 00:09:47,733
in the first place?
I was kind of a lonely kid, Dean.

172
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:49,835
You weren't lonely.
You had me.

173
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:02,615
Go on, bud.

174
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:05,184
Whatever happens,
it's cool beans.

175
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:10,323
Dean?
Hey.

176
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:11,857
Did you ask?

177
00:10:13,328 --> 00:10:15,161
Yeah, it's not gonna happen.

178
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:17,663
Come on. You<i> said.</i>

179
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:19,465
Look, I said I would ask.
Dad said no.

180
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:21,300
What do you want me to do
about it?

181
00:10:21,302 --> 00:10:23,569
But I've been shooting.
I can run 2 miles.

182
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:25,371
I know silver kills
werewolves, and --

183
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:26,906
Sammy...
No fair.

184
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:29,141
You started hunting
when you were younger than me.

185
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:30,943
Yeah, well, I never had
an imaginary friend.

186
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:32,945
I heard that.
Look, I'll keep working on dad, all right?

187
00:10:32,947 --> 00:10:34,513
Don't listen to him, Sammy.
He's a germ.

188
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:36,282
Now maybe you can come
next time.

189
00:10:36,284 --> 00:10:38,451
Sure.

190
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:43,489
All right, I gotta go.
Call you in a couple days.

191
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:46,192
Yep, I'll just be...

192
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:48,327
...Here.

193
00:10:54,168 --> 00:10:57,670
Hey, come on. We can finally
make those bottle rockets.

194
00:10:57,672 --> 00:11:00,239
Right?

195
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:09,148
Can I help you?
Mrs. Berman, I'm Dr. Strummer.

196
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,883
This is my associate --
Dr. MacGowan.

197
00:11:10,885 --> 00:11:13,252
We are trauma counselors
with child services.

198
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:16,789
We're here to follow up on
a police report filed yesterday?

199
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,258
Oh. That was...

200
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,193
Come in.

201
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:28,968
Uh, my daughter, Maddie,
she's the one who called.

202
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,571
Uh, she has
an active imagination.

203
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:36,375
She made up this unicorn man,
Sparkle.

204
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:40,312
But, um, she
thinks he's dead in her room.

205
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:44,984
So Sparkle is a unicorn
and also a man?

206
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:47,286
Yeah.
So a manicorn.

207
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:52,792
I...I guess?

208
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:54,093
May we, uh...

209
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:56,095
Yes, please. Thank you.
Great.

210
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:04,036
Hey, Maddie.

211
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:07,807
My partner and I would like
to ask you about last night.

212
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:09,909
About Sparkle?

213
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:14,513
Your mom says you don't wanna
go back into your room?

214
00:12:16,717 --> 00:12:18,818
How come?

215
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:22,922
All of the blood.

216
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:32,064
This has been her room
since she was a baby.

217
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:35,167
She's loved this room.
And then last night...

218
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:37,470
Do you mind if we take
a look around?

219
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:40,072
I'll be right back.
Mm.

220
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:45,811
All right. What's the problem?
I don't know.

221
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:50,049
I told you
it was horrible.

222
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:52,284
You mind enlightening us?

223
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:56,455
Oh. Mm.

224
00:12:59,627 --> 00:13:03,596
If I show you all we can see,
you can't tell a soul.

225
00:13:03,598 --> 00:13:04,930
Oh, yeah,
'cause chicks dig

226
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:06,665
the whole
imaginary friend thing.

227
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:10,102
Fine.

228
00:13:22,617 --> 00:13:24,483
Oh.

229
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:27,653
Oh, yeah. That kid is gonna need
<i>all</i> the shrinks.

230
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:31,490
Wait a second. So his...
blood is glittery?

231
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:35,094
Even when he's dead,
Sparkle can't stop shining.

232
00:13:41,502 --> 00:13:43,168
Who would do this?

233
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,004
It was a blade.

234
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:48,274
Sully, can Zanna see
other Zanna?

235
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:50,142
Of course.

236
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:51,744
But it's not
what you're thinking.

237
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:53,712
A Zanna could never do this.

238
00:13:54,482 --> 00:13:57,216
Nothing to see, right?

239
00:13:58,352 --> 00:14:00,052
I was always under
the impression

240
00:14:00,054 --> 00:14:03,088
that it was parent's job
to let a child be a child

241
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,657
as long as possible.
Oh, this is bad.

242
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:06,959
Maybe we let her get
too carried away.

243
00:14:06,961 --> 00:14:09,028
I don't know.

244
00:14:10,164 --> 00:14:12,531
I mean...

245
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:14,867
An imaginary friend
named Sparkle.

246
00:14:14,869 --> 00:14:17,736
What's cuter than that?

247
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,540
Oh.

248
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:22,942
Ugh.

249
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:24,343
I'm sorry.

250
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:26,178
I'm being as dramatic
as my daughter now.

251
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,846
Um, it's on her face.
Sam, it's on her face!

252
00:14:27,848 --> 00:14:31,016
Just tell me.
She's got Sparkle on her face!

253
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:32,551
How do we get our girl back?

254
00:14:35,323 --> 00:14:38,190
Somebody's say something.
Someone's gotta say something.

255
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:40,826
You know what?
Is there a spare bedroom?

256
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:43,829
Great. Uh, maybe Maddie can
sleep there. That should help.

257
00:14:43,831 --> 00:14:45,264
It's on her face.

258
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:48,734
And a hot shower does wonders.

259
00:14:48,736 --> 00:14:51,070
<i>Real</i> deep scrub. Purify.

260
00:14:51,072 --> 00:14:52,972
For Maddie?
The whole family.

261
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:55,040
Yeah, just get
the whole gang in there.

262
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:57,977
You know, the family
that showers together...

263
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:00,746
Pull up! Pull up.
Okay.

264
00:15:00,748 --> 00:15:02,648
You know what? Why --
why don't you start there?

265
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,986
You can contact our office
for more guidance if you like.

266
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:11,423
Okay.

267
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:24,970
Oh, my gosh, Zoe,
I think I saw the treasure, too!

268
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:26,238
Let's go for it!

269
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,706
But wait,
don't you have gymnastics?

270
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,908
Oh, yeah. Let's look at it
when I get back.

271
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,510
Right on.

272
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,061
Nicky didn't check in
with the home office last night.

273
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:31,997
This can't be happening.

274
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,431
You gazoos can talk
to each other?

275
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:37,269
Us<i> Zanna</i>
share a telepathic link.

276
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:39,804
She wouldn't be in there.

277
00:16:45,913 --> 00:16:47,913
A frickin' mermaid?

278
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:49,514
It's a bloodbath.

279
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:54,619
All right, just let it out.

280
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:56,254
Uh, no. No.

281
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:58,423
I gotta stay strong
for Sam.

282
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:02,994
Looks like more stabbing.

283
00:17:02,996 --> 00:17:04,763
Okay, Sully,
is there anybody

284
00:17:04,765 --> 00:17:07,899
that would want
to hurt, uh, Nicky?

285
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,569
No. Well...

286
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,070
What?

287
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,273
Oh, well, I mean,
her boyfriend's a little clingy.

288
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,943
But he's one of
my best friends.

289
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:21,279
Guys, Weems would never
hurt Nicky.

290
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:23,048
I mean,
he loved her too much.

291
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,516
Well, too much ain't good.

292
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:27,419
So let's go talk to
the mermaid's boyfriend,

293
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,720
because apparently,

294
00:17:28,722 --> 00:17:31,056
imaginary friends have
boyfriends now.

295
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:34,392
Wait! Wait!

296
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:38,697
We can't just leave her here.
It's disturbing for the kid.

297
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:40,365
All right, well,
what do you wanna do?

298
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:42,367
Find a giant toilet
and flush it?

299
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,037
You're right. I was...

300
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:48,139
What would you like us to do?

301
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:51,142
I think I saw some
shovels back there.

302
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:52,677
Okay.

303
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:01,186
Well, Totoro really cares
for you, huh?

304
00:18:05,993 --> 00:18:07,492
Okay, I got one.

305
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:08,893
Hit me.

306
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:10,862
Ever think...

307
00:18:10,864 --> 00:18:12,530
You can fly?

308
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:14,799
Oh, sometimes.

309
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:16,968
Like,
on really windy days.

310
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,738
You?
I used to,

311
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,139
but I broke my arm.

312
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,011
Your turn.
Okay.

313
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:27,846
Ever think...

314
00:18:27,848 --> 00:18:30,882
You could eat
10 waffles in one sitting?

315
00:18:30,884 --> 00:18:34,052
Well, I hope so
when I'm big. Can you?

316
00:18:34,054 --> 00:18:37,022
I tried, once.

317
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:44,462
Whoa. Head rush.

318
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:47,932
Ever think...

319
00:18:50,904 --> 00:18:52,604
About running away?

320
00:18:52,606 --> 00:18:54,739
From you? No way.

321
00:18:54,741 --> 00:18:58,109
No. I mean, from here.

322
00:18:58,111 --> 00:18:59,778
All this.

323
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,580
The hunting life.

324
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:04,749
Do you?

325
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:11,356
Hmm.

326
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,759
Ever think...

327
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:17,395
That maybe you wanna
go to school?

328
00:19:17,397 --> 00:19:19,464
Make some friends?

329
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:21,599
But I have you.

330
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:24,969
Yeah, you do.

331
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:28,406
But one day you won't.

332
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:35,013
Sam, I want you to listen
to me.

333
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:37,916
You can be whatever
you wanna be.

334
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:41,319
You're not Dean.
You're not your dad.

335
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:43,321
You're Sam.

336
00:19:43,323 --> 00:19:45,790
And Sam is so awesome.

337
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,595
Can you imagine?
Running away?

338
00:19:50,597 --> 00:19:53,264
My dad would<i> kill</i> me.

339
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:54,966
Well...

340
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:57,368
It's your choice, Sam.

341
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,105
It's your life.
I mean, it's all up to you.

342
00:20:08,882 --> 00:20:10,648
Okay.

343
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,150
Okay?

344
00:20:12,152 --> 00:20:14,185
Let's go.

345
00:20:21,528 --> 00:20:24,462
Hey, slacker.

346
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:26,498
Am I burying Ariel by myself
here or what?

347
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,534
No. Yeah, of course.
Let's go.

348
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:37,776
How you holding up, Sully?

349
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,011
I'm fine.

350
00:20:40,013 --> 00:20:41,513
How are you, Sam?

351
00:20:41,515 --> 00:20:44,349
Aces.

352
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:53,525
Don't worry, kid.

353
00:20:53,527 --> 00:20:56,161
Everybody's got
a pee-pee problem.

354
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:57,962
Weems will take care
of these sheets,

355
00:20:57,964 --> 00:21:00,465
and mommy will be
none the wiser.

356
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,767
What if mommy hears us?

357
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:06,604
Fletcher, not even a parade
can wake mommy up tonight.

358
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:10,308
Because she drank her grown-up
juice and went sleepy-by?

359
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,745
Yep. Mommy drank
<i>a lot</i> of juice tonight.

360
00:21:15,015 --> 00:21:17,982
Hey, you wanna try
and hit the sack?

361
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:20,985
All right. I'll catch you
on the flip side, okay, bud?

362
00:21:20,987 --> 00:21:22,887
Thanks, Weems.

363
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:25,290
You got it.

364
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,609
?

365
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:33,591
Sully!

366
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:35,927
Uhh! Sully.

367
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:38,162
Sully. Oh.

368
00:22:38,164 --> 00:22:40,265
Sul--

369
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:42,901
Sully. Sully.

370
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:58,209
?

371
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:33,645
?

372
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:38,783
Weems! Weems, are you okay?

373
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:41,820
Yeah.

374
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:44,889
It went right through
my love handle.

375
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:47,158
My fat saved me.
Can you believe that?

376
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,594
Fat is the best.
Yeah.

377
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:52,063
Yeah, well, the mermaid
wasn't so lucky.

378
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:54,165
Is he talking to<i> me?</i>

379
00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:57,001
Who are these guys?

380
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:59,504
They're friends.

381
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:02,474
Hey, Weems, when was the last
time you saw Nicky the mermaid?

382
00:24:02,476 --> 00:24:03,975
God, I can't
believe I just said that.

383
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:06,311
Yesterday. Why?

384
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:07,779
What happened to Nicky?

385
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,080
She was murdered.

386
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:10,648
What?!

387
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,684
Weems, I am so sorry.

388
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:17,255
No!
She -- she was my girl!

389
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:19,858
Sparkle's gone, too.

390
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,927
Not Sparkle! Dude, that's,
like, our whole posse.

391
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,629
I know, right?

392
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,531
But hey, you're okay.
You're okay.

393
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:28,299
Okay, all right,
so you're all pals.

394
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,101
Is there anybody who would
have beef with the bunch of you?

395
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:32,237
I've never seen her before
in my life.

396
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,638
Wait a second.
You saw somebody?

397
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,840
Some chick.

398
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:38,309
After she...Shivved me,

399
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:41,546
she took off
in an old VW Bug.

400
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,216
I'm so sorry, Weems.
So this is a good thing, right?

401
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:47,485
Uh, no, this is a<i> great</i> thing.
It's gross!

402
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,854
I mean, a manicorn?
A freakin' mermaid?

403
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,823
What am I supposed to do
with that?

404
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:54,392
But a chick in a car?
That's Terra firma. I'm home.

405
00:24:54,394 --> 00:24:57,529
All right, you go.
I'll, uh, cover these two.

406
00:24:57,531 --> 00:24:59,998
It goes -- it's -- yeah,
it goes all the way through.

407
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,466
I gotta ask.

408
00:25:01,468 --> 00:25:04,369
Hey, uh, acid wash.

409
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:05,937
What's so special about you?

410
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:08,673
Mermaids dig me?

411
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,242
No, I-i mean,
why do<i> kids</i> like you?

412
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:13,811
Oh.

413
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:16,014
I play air guitar.

414
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,917
You play air guitar?

415
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:21,853
Sam plays air guitar.
<i>I</i> can play air guitar.

416
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,420
Aah! Oh!
That's okay, it's okay.

417
00:25:55,422 --> 00:25:57,222
Good solo. Good solo.
Thanks.

418
00:25:59,526 --> 00:26:02,126
Well, he's no Clapton.

419
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:06,097
You know, I'm gonna go get
some bandages. Okay?

420
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:11,402
Oh, I'll be right back, Sam.

421
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:15,873
Wait.

422
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,943
You're not<i> that</i> Sam?

423
00:26:20,614 --> 00:26:22,647
Sully's Sam?

424
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,818
I guess I would be. Yeah.

425
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,588
So now you and Sully
are, like, back together?

426
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,056
What?

427
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:33,891
How old are you?
Wrong.

428
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:35,493
Look, I get it.

429
00:26:35,495 --> 00:26:37,662
We all need a tune-up
from time to time. It's okay.

430
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:43,001
No.<i> He,</i> uh, came to me.
I'm helping<i> him</i> out.

431
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:48,306
Sam Winchester.

432
00:26:48,308 --> 00:26:50,441
I mean...

433
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,143
Wow.

434
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:55,513
Hey, just so you know...

435
00:26:55,515 --> 00:26:58,750
Sully?

436
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:00,652
You broke his heart, man.

437
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:06,090
?

438
00:27:09,362 --> 00:27:10,795
Ready to hit the road?

439
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:13,431
No. My dad just called.

440
00:27:13,433 --> 00:27:15,466
Yeah?
He changed his mind.

441
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:18,202
He wants me
to come with him.

442
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:19,671
On a -- on a hunt?

443
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:21,773
Finally! He thinks I'm ready.

444
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:24,542
I have to catch the next bus
to Milwaukee.

445
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,577
Are you sure this is
what you want?

446
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:29,280
I'm a Winchester.
I hunt monsters.

447
00:27:29,282 --> 00:27:31,549
Why would I want
anything else?

448
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:34,118
Well, I-I'm not sure
it's you.

449
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,689
Why can't you be happy
for me, Sully?

450
00:27:37,691 --> 00:27:39,123
Listen, buddy,

451
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:41,059
I'm just afraid
you're going down a path

452
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:42,794
you might be better off
not going down.

453
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:44,696
Yeah, but<i> I'm</i> not afraid.

454
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:46,130
I know you're not.

455
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:47,965
You're one of
the bravest kids I know.

456
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:50,335
It's just...
This whole hunting thing,

457
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,437
you know,
it's not the only way.

458
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:55,139
There are so many other ways.
And you can find one, Sam.

459
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,075
You can leave right now.

460
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:58,643
I don't want another way.

461
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:01,312
I wanna be with my dad
and -- and Dean.

462
00:28:01,314 --> 00:28:02,780
Look, Sam,

463
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:05,049
I'm just saying this
'cause I'm your friend.

464
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:08,519
Pretend friend!

465
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,221
You're not even real.

466
00:28:10,223 --> 00:28:13,624
Well, I'm -- I'm here
as long as you need me.

467
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:15,393
I don't need you anymore,
Sully.

468
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:18,029
I don't even know why I made you
up in the first place.

469
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:20,832
I wish
I could<i> unmake</i> you up.

470
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,036
If -- if that --
if that's what you want.

471
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:27,038
It is, okay?

472
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:35,446
Just go.

473
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,852
You have
a good, long life, Sam.

474
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:07,879
No,
you did a good job.

475
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:10,081
Is it too tight?
No.

476
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,250
All right, that's good.

477
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:14,252
Okay.
There you go, pal.

478
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:16,788
All right.

479
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:20,191
I'm gonna go check
on Fletcher.

480
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:22,193
Kid has a bladder
like a sieve.

481
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:33,738
You know, it's...
pretty awesome,

482
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,808
how you help everyone
around you.

483
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:40,111
Doesn't always work out,
but...

484
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:42,814
I try.

485
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:44,549
Sully...

486
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:47,385
I feel awful.

487
00:29:47,387 --> 00:29:49,420
About how we left off.

488
00:29:49,422 --> 00:29:53,891
I'm sorry. I was a kid.
I was a-a jerk kid.

489
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:56,627
And -- and you were
trying to help, and...

490
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,229
That's all on me.

491
00:29:58,231 --> 00:30:01,332
I mean, goodbyes are part
of the job, and ours was...

492
00:30:01,334 --> 00:30:03,167
Pretty bad.

493
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:06,037
Yeah.
It was really bad.

494
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,880
You know,
I'm not gonna lie to ya.

495
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:17,548
When you went off to hunt,

496
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,651
I considered that one of
my biggest failures.

497
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:27,024
It just seemed so clear to me
that you wanted something else.

498
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:30,862
But...I was wrong.

499
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,966
And it all worked out,
didn't it?

500
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:36,634
I don't know about that.

501
00:30:36,636 --> 00:30:38,503
Come on.

502
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:40,004
You're a hero.

503
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:42,373
Sam, you saved the world.

504
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:47,245
I keep track of my kids.

505
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:49,914
And you did
really good, Sam.

506
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:54,185
Well...Not all good.

507
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:57,054
There was some bad.

508
00:30:57,056 --> 00:31:00,224
And some<i> really</i> bad.

509
00:31:02,762 --> 00:31:06,631
Sully...

510
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:09,734
I screwed up.

511
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:14,505
I let something out
into the world that was...

512
00:31:14,507 --> 00:31:17,141
You mean the Darkness?

513
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:19,610
That's what the others
are calling it.

514
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:21,078
I've just heard rumors.

515
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,714
Well, I'm gonna fix it.
I am.

516
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:26,617
Dean and I, we're -- we're --
we're gonna fix it.

517
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,219
It's just...

518
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:30,354
What is it?

519
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:34,525
I think God
wants to help us fix it.

520
00:31:37,964 --> 00:31:39,897
But...

521
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:43,067
I don't think I can do
what he's asking.

522
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:47,071
How bad is it?

523
00:31:49,442 --> 00:31:54,045
There's this cage in hell,

524
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:57,515
and it's where
they keep Lucifer.

525
00:31:57,517 --> 00:31:59,483
And I've been in it,

526
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:02,920
and it's...

527
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:06,490
And I think
God wants me to go back.

528
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:21,606
Ever think...

529
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,908
About running away anymore?

530
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:33,317
I did. Um, I mean, I have.

531
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:40,491
But not in a while.
Not anymore.

532
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:56,507
Ever think...

533
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:02,346
About hot-wiring
a minivan?

534
00:33:03,683 --> 00:33:05,483
In my dreams.

535
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:07,885
Let's do it.

536
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:23,968
Good. You're awake.

537
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,937
Your brother's on the way.

538
00:33:33,713 --> 00:33:37,682
?

539
00:33:56,636 --> 00:33:58,936
Who the hell are you?

540
00:33:58,938 --> 00:34:03,908
I think we have a mutual
imaginary friend.

541
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,380
You know Sully?

542
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:15,453
?

543
00:34:29,928 --> 00:34:31,661
Hold it.

544
00:34:33,632 --> 00:34:35,765
Reese?

545
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:39,369
Hey, stranger.

546
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:43,039
You give me Sully,
I give you your brother.

547
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,974
What do you want
with Sully?

548
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:47,210
Ask him.

549
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:50,046
He's the one who killed
my sister.

550
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:54,517
It was an accident.

551
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:56,119
What?

552
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:58,254
Reese and her twin sister,
they were my first kids

553
00:34:58,256 --> 00:35:00,223
after I thought
I screwed things up with you.

554
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:02,659
So this is<i> his</i> fault?
No!

555
00:35:02,661 --> 00:35:05,428
No, Reese,
I'm the one that bungled it.

556
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,831
It was me.

557
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:12,368
I should never have let her
chase me into the street.

558
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,971
We were just playing tag.

559
00:35:14,973 --> 00:35:17,974
I don't know why I didn't
see the car coming.

560
00:35:17,976 --> 00:35:20,143
That's why I never went back
in the field.

561
00:35:20,145 --> 00:35:23,480
That's why I never found
another kid.

562
00:35:23,482 --> 00:35:25,315
I was too scared
I'd hurt 'em.

563
00:35:25,317 --> 00:35:28,952
Do you know how bad
you messed me up?

564
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:33,990
“Audrey's dead because of
the invisible man.”

565
00:35:33,992 --> 00:35:37,127
try telling that to about
10 different kiddie shrinks.

566
00:35:39,164 --> 00:35:42,165
I always wondered
if Sully was real,

567
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:44,534
so I got obsessed
with folklore.

568
00:35:44,536 --> 00:35:48,271
I studied abroad in Romania,
and then I found out

569
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:49,739
he's a Zanna.

570
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:51,407
Yes, and Zanna are good.

571
00:35:51,409 --> 00:35:53,510
That's what the witch
tried to tell me, too.

572
00:35:53,512 --> 00:35:56,146
The witch?
She sold me a spell

573
00:35:56,148 --> 00:35:58,882
so that I'd be able
to see these freaks.

574
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:03,419
She gave me this, too.

575
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:09,292
Finally, I can save other kids
from these monsters.

576
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:11,794
So you killed my friends
just to get to me?

577
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:14,864
And I would've done it sooner
if these two hadn't shown up.

578
00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:18,434
Why didn't you call?
I would've come.

579
00:36:18,436 --> 00:36:24,274
Honestly, I kinda liked
watching you suffer.

580
00:36:24,276 --> 00:36:27,377
You weren't just
Audrey's best friend.

581
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:29,913
You were mine, too.

582
00:36:29,915 --> 00:36:32,448
And after she died, Sully,
I...

583
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:35,785
I never needed you more.

584
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:44,794
I panicked when Audrey died,

585
00:36:44,796 --> 00:36:48,631
and I left you
to deal with the pain

586
00:36:48,633 --> 00:36:52,202
'cause I couldn't handle
being the one that caused it.

587
00:36:52,204 --> 00:36:54,938
So maybe I'll take something
<i>you</i> love, Sully --

588
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,573
a<i> real</i> person.

589
00:36:56,575 --> 00:36:59,008
That's not gonna happen.

590
00:37:00,545 --> 00:37:02,579
Will killing me
make you feel better?

591
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:04,247
No, Sully,
that's not the answer.

592
00:37:04,249 --> 00:37:06,783
This is what I do.

593
00:37:06,785 --> 00:37:08,785
Whatever's best for the kid.

594
00:37:08,787 --> 00:37:11,287
Reesy...

595
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:15,892
If this is
what you need,

596
00:37:15,894 --> 00:37:18,228
I'm okay with it.

597
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:28,004
I'm still mad.

598
00:37:28,006 --> 00:37:30,373
I can't stop it.

599
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:33,843
I'm just still so<i> mad!</i>

600
00:37:40,252 --> 00:37:44,320
?

601
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:46,889
Reese.

602
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:49,759
Trust me. Revenge?

603
00:37:49,761 --> 00:37:53,830
Ain't gonna make you
feel better.

604
00:37:53,832 --> 00:37:56,833
Listen, I have seen more than
my share of monsters.

605
00:37:56,835 --> 00:37:59,102
And I mean<i> real</i> monsters.

606
00:37:59,104 --> 00:38:01,070
Bad.

607
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:02,705
These guys?

608
00:38:02,707 --> 00:38:06,542
These are  Sesame Street
mother Teresas.

609
00:38:06,544 --> 00:38:11,447
But when I wasn't there
for my little brother,

610
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:13,182
Sully was.

611
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:18,688
Now, look, I'm not saying
that he didn't make a mistake,

612
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:22,625
but you know that there is not
a monstrous bone in his body.

613
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:34,537
I'm so,<i> so</i> sorry.

614
00:38:49,821 --> 00:38:52,822
Oh, Reesy,
I'm so sorry.

615
00:38:58,563 --> 00:39:01,030
?

616
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,655
Well, now that you know
about Audrey,

617
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,658
you probably never wanna
see me again.

618
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,296
Ever think...

619
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:30,166
Maybe you're a hero to me?

620
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,635
Yeah.
Sully...

621
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:35,371
One thing I've learned --

622
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,306
heroes aren't perfect.

623
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,475
Mm.

624
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,578
Sometimes, they're scared.

625
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:47,350
But that just means
the thing that they're facing,

626
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:50,153
it's super important.

627
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,654
And nobody else is
gonna go for it

628
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:54,290
because nobody else
has got the balls.

629
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:01,330
Well, it is that time
again.

630
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,766
You, um,
you'll look in on Reese?

631
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,235
Don't worry.
I will be checking in.

632
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,471
And, Dean,

633
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:10,439
thank you
for looking out for Sam.

634
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,709
<i>You</i> are not a germ
at all.

635
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:16,379
Thanks?

636
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,448
You know, you're not gonna
ever get me to admit

637
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,050
that you're not
the weirdest thing out there,

638
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,753
but, um...

639
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,688
You're a good weird.

640
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,590
Mm.

641
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,693
Good luck, buddy.

642
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:37,200
Let's do it.

643
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:57,553
Dean, we need
to seriously discuss

644
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:00,556
me going to the cage.

645
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,592
Okay.

646
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:05,127
Not happening. Good talk.

647
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:12,702
Sam, even if these visions
are real --

648
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:17,907
yeah. It's Lucifer?
And me?

649
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:20,376
In the cage? I know.

650
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:25,281
But this --
this lump in my throat...

651
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:27,717
It's not an excuse,
not anymore.

652
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:30,086
We'll find another way.

653
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:34,590
Okay? There's always
another way.

654
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,960
Okay.

655
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:41,397
Then tell me.

656
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:43,499
What is the other way?

657
