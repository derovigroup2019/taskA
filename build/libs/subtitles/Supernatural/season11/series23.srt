1
00:00:00,941 --> 00:00:02,000
Surprise!

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,491
? Carry on, my wayward son ?

3
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:10,407
? There'll be peace
when you are done ?

4
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:14,378
? Lay your weary head to rest ?

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,714
? Don't you cry no more ?

6
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:21,685
Where you going?

7
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:24,955
To see the child
that eats souls.

8
00:00:24,957 --> 00:00:26,857
In order to
create the world,

9
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:31,728
God had to give up
his only kin to darkness.

10
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:35,966
I was the beginning,
and I will be the end.

11
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:38,201
We're bonded.

12
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:40,037
? Once I rose above the noise and confusion ?
Sam: She's the sister of God.

13
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,139
- God.
- She picked you.

14
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:44,408
? Just to get a glimpse
beyond this illusion ?

15
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,143
You have to understand
this about the Darkness...

16
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:48,412
? I was soaring ever higher ?
...she's relentless.

17
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:50,447
It's the only reason I came off
the sidelines.

18
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:52,382
Where on earth are we gonna find
an answer on how to stop her?

19
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:53,984
The hand of God.

20
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:56,653
? Though my eyes could see,
I still was a blind man ?

21
00:00:56,655 --> 00:01:00,524
? Though my mind could think,
I still was a mad man ?

22
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:03,260
Only Lucifer can beat Amara.

23
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:05,395
Can you really beat her?
I can.

24
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:06,496
Then yes.

25
00:01:06,498 --> 00:01:07,631
? I can hear them say ?

26
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:09,299
That's not Cass!

27
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:11,401
? Carry on, my wayward son ?

28
00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:12,869
<i>Attenuare!</i>

29
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:15,806
? There'll be peace
when you are done ?

30
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:19,309
? Lay your weary head to rest ?

31
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:21,845
? Don't you cry no more ?

32
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:23,113
Amara, no!

33
00:01:40,265 --> 00:01:42,099
Check on him.

34
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:45,135
Hey.

35
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:47,671
Chuck.

36
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:51,308
Can you hear me?

37
00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:57,547
Dean.

38
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:59,916
Cass?

39
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:01,651
Hey, is that you?

40
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:03,587
Hey, can you hear me?

41
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:05,188
All right.

42
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,958
Lucifer is gone.

43
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:11,328
Amara ripped him
from my body.

44
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,063
To where?

45
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:14,731
I don't know.

46
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,001
Come on.

47
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:21,204
Are you, uh...

48
00:02:21,206 --> 00:02:23,607
H-How do you feel?

49
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:25,642
Ohh.

50
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:28,945
You know when you're driving
and a bug hits your windshield?

51
00:02:30,082 --> 00:02:31,648
I'm the bug.

52
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:35,752
So, what Amara said
about you...

53
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:37,387
Dying.

54
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:39,022
Yeah, whatever
she did to me,

55
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:42,425
I can feel my spark,
my light fading.

56
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:43,693
And when it's gone...

57
00:02:43,695 --> 00:02:46,096
Okay, well,
t-tell us how to fix you.

58
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:48,031
You can't.

59
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:50,700
I-I-I suppose she could,
maybe,

60
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:53,470
but that's never gonna happen.

61
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:58,175
So that <i>was</i> a gun
in your pocket.

62
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:04,681
Well...

63
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:10,187
that was a complete and utter
dog's breakfast, wasn't it?

64
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,223
I didn't know dogs
had breakfast.

65
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:15,158
Cass is back.

66
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,230
Just curious -- has anyone
bothered to look outside?

What is it?

70
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,227
- It looks like the sun is --
- Dying.

71
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:54,631
Why would Amara do that?

72
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:57,834
The sun is the source of all
life on earth.

73
00:03:57,836 --> 00:04:00,337
Without it,
everything just...

74
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:02,072
just wastes away.

75
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,407
Let's get the hell
out of here.

76
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:11,214
You.

77
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:13,483
Still got a few tricks
up my sleeve.

78
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:14,618
I'm not dead y...

79
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,820
Oh, whoa.
Okay. I got you.

80
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:18,221
- I should probably sit down.
- Yeah. Come on.

81
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:20,056
All right.

82
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:21,891
Okay.
What do we do now?

83
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:41,344
Really?

84
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:44,080
Really.

85
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:46,249
What?

86
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:48,952
We hit Amara with everything
we got,

87
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:50,820
and she walked it off.

88
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:51,855
So...

89
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:53,757
So it's last call?

90
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,660
That's right.

91
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:58,328
Look, man.

92
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,264
If you've got something for me
to punch, shoot, or kill,

93
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:02,599
let me know
and I'll do it.

94
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:03,933
I'll do it till I die.

95
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,338
But how are we supposed to fix
the friggin' sun?

96
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:34,564
Thank you, Reggie.

97
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:50,680
Hello, hello?

98
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:52,982
Ah, milady.
Let me.

99
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:55,118
Anna,
we've had this talk.

100
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,253
It's not "milady."
It's Toni.

101
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:58,988
Of course, milady.

102
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,457
Where's the boss?

103
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,092
Down for his nap.

104
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:03,326
Tea's laid out
in the study.

105
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:05,061
Thank God.

106
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:13,069
<i>...astronomers at</i>
<i>the Royal Observatory</i>

107
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,839
<i>may have the answer.</i>
<i>Dr. Nigel Pinfield explains.</i>

108
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:18,942
<i>We have registered a 6% drop</i>

109
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:20,543
<i>in the sun's energy output,</i>

110
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:22,979
<i>and yes, it happened</i>
<i>quite suddenly,</i>

111
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:25,482
<i>but people need</i>
<i>to understand --</i>

112
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:28,284
<i>our sun goes through periods</i>
<i>of high activity</i>

113
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:29,786
<i>and low activity.</i>

114
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:32,989
<i>While this is somewhat...</i>
<i>unusual,</i>

115
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:35,258
<i>there's certainly nothing</i>
<i>to worry abo--</i>

116
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,626
If only.

117
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:41,598
Hello?

118
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,701
No. I'm alone.

119
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:46,636
What?!

120
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:49,739
Really?

121
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:54,544
The bloody sun's cracked.

122
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:02,986
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

123
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:04,854
With what's happening,
are you sure

124
00:07:04,856 --> 00:07:07,924
this is the wisest use
of our resources?

125
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:09,959
No.

126
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:11,327
No, I understand.

127
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:14,063
Yes, sir.

128
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:24,874
On my way.

129
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:39,272
You know what?
This isn't gonna be enough.

130
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:40,473
I better make a run.

131
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:42,208
No reason
to die sober, huh?

132
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,210
You want to?

133
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:46,279
No!

134
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:52,552
Charles,
I'll put the kettle on.

135
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:54,087
My mom always said,

136
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:57,090
there's nothing a nice wee cup
of tea can't fix.

137
00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:59,025
Be right back.

138
00:07:59,027 --> 00:08:01,060
I'll stay here,
find our Plan B.

139
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:04,230
Okay.
Cass, come on.

140
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:06,599
Teapot?

141
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,336
She's using you.

142
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:12,972
It's what she does.

143
00:08:12,974 --> 00:08:16,576
Find someone
with power...

144
00:08:16,578 --> 00:08:20,213
cozies up...

145
00:08:20,215 --> 00:08:22,148
digs the claws in.

146
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,816
Hmm.

147
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:27,620
Yeah, well, I'm not helping
anyone right now, obviously.

148
00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:31,491
She's been...nice.

149
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:33,059
For now.

150
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:35,261
Now's kind of all we got.

151
00:08:35,263 --> 00:08:37,330
Whatever.

152
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:39,932
I'm not calling you Dad.

153
00:08:55,684 --> 00:08:58,084
You don't want
to say goodbye.

154
00:08:58,086 --> 00:08:59,719
It's easier this way.

155
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:03,323
Tell him I'll be home
as soon as I can.

156
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:05,458
How bad is it?

157
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,327
All the way.

158
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:09,729
Right.

159
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,600
Packed you
a little something,

160
00:09:14,602 --> 00:09:17,970
just if all your mumbo jumbo
doesn't work.

161
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:20,907
Now, Fergus <i>was</i> bright.

162
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:23,109
Walked before
his first birthday,

163
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:24,377
but he hated pants.

164
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:25,745
Hated them.

165
00:09:25,747 --> 00:09:27,146
He'd run 'round
the village,

166
00:09:27,148 --> 00:09:29,315
his wee banger just flapping
in the breeze.

167
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:33,586
Adam and Eve
were the same way.

168
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:36,756
Kids.   Kids.

169
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:39,492
I'm so glad the world
is ending.

170
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,797
Samantha!

171
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,433
W-What are we doing?

172
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:49,836
Nothing.
Exactly.

173
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:51,604
Amara's out there eating
the freaking sun,

174
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:53,106
and -- and
we're doing <i>nothing.</i>

175
00:09:53,108 --> 00:09:54,607
And you have
a better idea?

176
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:56,509
Yes. Anything.

177
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:57,677
That's my better idea,

178
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,779
because anything is better
than <i>this.</i>

179
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:02,615
Sam. I get it.

180
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:05,184
Even if we could
lock Amara away,

181
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:06,919
it wouldn't do
any good now.

182
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:10,890
I'm dying.

183
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:13,860
And when I'm gone,

184
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:17,530
a cosmic balance between light
and dark --

185
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:20,533
it's over.

186
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,840
All right.

187
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:33,679
Then if we can't cage her,
we have to kill her.

188
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:35,748
Bingo.

189
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:45,925
How you doing?
You good?

190
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:50,096
I mean, you know,
the whole Lucifer thing.

191
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:52,565
I was just...

192
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,100
so stupid.

193
00:10:54,102 --> 00:10:56,169
No, no, no.
It wasn't stupid.

194
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:57,570
You were right.

195
00:10:57,572 --> 00:10:59,105
You were right to let Lucifer
ride shotgun.

196
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:01,174
Me and Sam
wouldn't have done that.

197
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:03,009
Well, it didn't work.

198
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:05,344
No, but it was
our best shot,

199
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:07,346
and you stepped up.

200
00:11:07,348 --> 00:11:10,683
I was just
trying to help.

201
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:13,085
Well,
and you do help, Cass.

202
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:14,320
You know, I --

203
00:11:14,322 --> 00:11:16,456
You know,
sometimes me and Sam

204
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,225
have got so much going on
that...

205
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:21,594
we forget about
everyone else.

206
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:24,897
Well, you do live
exciting lives.

207
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,433
Yeah, that's one word for it.

208
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:31,804
But you're always there,
you know?

209
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:37,109
You're the best friend
we've ever had.

210
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:42,415
You're our brother, Cass.
I want you to know that.

211
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:46,252
Thank you.

212
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:51,724
Yo.

213
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:55,595
All right.
We're on our way.

214
00:11:55,597 --> 00:11:57,864
Sam's got something.

215
00:12:04,873 --> 00:12:08,174
Wait, so now you want
to kill the Darkness?

216
00:12:08,176 --> 00:12:09,575
You're cool with this?

217
00:12:09,577 --> 00:12:11,310
'Cause, you know,
last time...

218
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:12,445
Look, Chuck's dying.

219
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,782
Uh, no offense, God.

220
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:19,085
Yeah,
no, I -- I'm dying.

221
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:20,720
So, we don't really have
a choice.

222
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:23,256
I mean, look.
Y-You've got darkness and light.

223
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:24,957
Y-You take one side
away a-and --

224
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,192
It upsets the scales --

225
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:27,393
the whole balance
of the universe.

226
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:29,262
Exactly.
But you take both away,

227
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:32,365
and now both sides of the scale
are empty, so...

228
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:33,466
Of course.
It's balanced.

229
00:12:33,468 --> 00:12:35,401
Right. Yes. Okay.
Uh, and look.

230
00:12:35,403 --> 00:12:39,472
Hey, I'm game, but how exactly
are we gonna do this?

231
00:12:39,474 --> 00:12:42,775
I mean, Lucifer hit her
with a-a hand of God,

232
00:12:42,777 --> 00:12:44,477
and, well, we saw how that
turned out.

233
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,112
Yeah.

234
00:12:46,114 --> 00:12:49,015
She does seem impossible
to destroy.

235
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:50,316
Right.

236
00:12:50,318 --> 00:12:53,286
Is she, Chuck?

237
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:56,989
Well, I...

238
00:12:56,991 --> 00:12:59,225
I mean, well...

239
00:12:59,227 --> 00:13:00,426
I...I-I --

240
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:01,928
- Chuck!
- Charles!

241
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,897
All right. Fine.

242
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:08,367
The Darkness might --
<i>might</i> have a weakness --

243
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:10,202
Light.

244
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:12,872
He tells us now.

245
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:14,774
What?
I-I just wanted to trap her.

246
00:13:14,776 --> 00:13:16,108
I didn't want to murder her.

247
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,077
Okay, but now that we're
trying to end her,

248
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,879
how much light
are we talking about?

249
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:20,947
I don't know.

250
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:23,816
10,000 suns set to supernova.

251
00:13:23,818 --> 00:13:26,085
Well, y-you're God.

252
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:28,321
So, just God them up.

253
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:30,256
Look at me.
I'm...

254
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:32,224
not in the best shape
right now.

255
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:33,793
Okay.
Uh, that's all right.

256
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:35,695
Uh, we just need
other ideas.

257
00:13:35,697 --> 00:13:36,996
Um...

258
00:13:36,998 --> 00:13:38,297
Rowena.

259
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:39,665
What about
the Book of the Damned?

260
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,934
This is beyond...

261
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:43,302
Okay, Crowley?

262
00:13:43,304 --> 00:13:45,071
Oh, I got nothing.

263
00:13:45,073 --> 00:13:47,940
Well, what about souls?
They fuel your demon deals.

264
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:49,575
Souls are
living batteries.

265
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:51,344
They're full of energy.
They're full of light.

266
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:53,412
Each one is
as powerful as...

267
00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:54,780
100 suns?

268
00:13:54,782 --> 00:13:56,282
H-He's not wrong.

269
00:13:56,284 --> 00:13:59,118
Okay, so if we got this kind
of juice, then what?

270
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,554
You get me enough souls...

271
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:03,889
I can build a bomb.

272
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:05,324
Would that do the trick?

273
00:14:05,326 --> 00:14:07,159
Uh...

274
00:14:07,161 --> 00:14:08,427
maybe.

275
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:09,862
All right.
Plan B.

276
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:12,098
Okay. How many souls
are we talking here?

277
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,633
The more the better.

278
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:16,936
Even if you could get that kind
of firepower...

279
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:19,038
you really think
it would work?

280
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,640
I can ask the angels.

281
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:21,974
Heaven is full of souls.

282
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:23,075
Okay.
Uh, what else we got?

283
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:24,944
Ghosts.

284
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:26,912
Well, they're just souls
with baggage, right?

285
00:14:26,914 --> 00:14:29,749
Yeah, but we would need
a whole lot of them.

286
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:32,618
Waverly Hills.

287
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:37,089
Waverly Hills Sanatorium.

288
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:38,591
Of course.

289
00:14:38,593 --> 00:14:40,826
Thousands died there.

290
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:41,927
Ton of ghosts.

291
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:43,929
This is desperate...

292
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:45,264
and stupid.

293
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:46,699
Well,
desperate and stupid's

294
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:48,134
pretty much all we got
right now, so...

295
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:49,502
Fine.

296
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:51,537
I'll go raid Hell
and see what's left.

297
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:53,005
All right.

298
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:54,940
Let's get to work.

299
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:48,527
Really think
this is gonna work?

300
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:49,929
Well,
Rowena said it would.

301
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:51,630
Oh. Yeah.

302
00:15:51,632 --> 00:15:54,500
It's a Book
of the Damned spell, boyos.

303
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:55,968
Take this wee crystal.

304
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,537
It'll suck up all
the blimey ghosts.

305
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:00,139
Just say the magic word.

306
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:25,197
Place really lives up
to the hype.

307
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,500
Yes, it does.

308
00:16:27,502 --> 00:16:31,904
Let's give the magic word
a shot, because we're six.

309
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:46,385
All right.
Let's bust some ghosts.

310
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:00,566
Where the heck are they?

311
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:02,668
You got me.

312
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,941
Get your Casper asses
out here!

313
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:12,278
You know what?

314
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,313
Why don't you finish up?
I'll go piss them off.

315
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:15,548
Yeah.

316
00:17:47,915 --> 00:17:49,782
Okay, I think it worked!

317
00:17:57,658 --> 00:17:59,091
Ha ha!

318
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:23,816
- Say the magic word!
- Aah!

319
00:18:24,785 --> 00:18:26,018
Dean, hurry!

320
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,519
Haggis!

321
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:48,507
Go magic word.

322
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:49,708
Huh.

323
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,910
Yeah.

324
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:13,446
The angels are --
Heaven won't help.

325
00:19:13,447 --> 00:19:14,746
They know that this is
the end, right?

326
00:19:14,748 --> 00:19:16,247
Of everything.
Yes.

327
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:17,315
And they don't care?

328
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:19,484
No, it's not that.
It's...

329
00:19:19,486 --> 00:19:22,387
They know --
They know God is dying

330
00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:23,788
and they don't think
we can win this.

331
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,523
Souls or no souls.

332
00:19:25,525 --> 00:19:26,991
They're sealing Heaven,

333
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:28,993
and they're
"dying with dignity".

334
00:19:28,995 --> 00:19:30,295
Well, that's awesome.

335
00:19:30,297 --> 00:19:32,230
All right, Crowley.
What about you?

336
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:33,698
Well, I <i>had</i> all the souls
we needed.

337
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,200
What do you mean "had"?

338
00:19:35,202 --> 00:19:36,734
While I was indisposed,

339
00:19:36,736 --> 00:19:39,437
a few of my demonic pals decided
to raid my stash.

340
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:43,241
Well, what we have --
it's not enough.

341
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:47,745
Well, that could be nothing
but good news.

342
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:12,871
Nice digs.

343
00:20:12,873 --> 00:20:15,440
Billie?

344
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:17,108
Who's Billie?

345
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,443
Reaper.

346
00:20:18,445 --> 00:20:19,744
Wants us dead.

347
00:20:19,746 --> 00:20:21,179
Tons of fun.

348
00:20:24,284 --> 00:20:26,084
Hey.

349
00:20:28,221 --> 00:20:31,723
Wait a second.
H-How did yo--

350
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:33,725
What are you
doing here?

351
00:20:33,727 --> 00:20:36,294
I saw you boys
at Waverly Hills,

352
00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:38,329
and call me
a curious kitten,

353
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:41,266
but with, you know,
credits about to roll,

354
00:20:41,268 --> 00:20:42,867
I got to ask --

355
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:44,936
why you boys
busting ghosts?

356
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:46,404
Why do you care?

357
00:20:46,406 --> 00:20:49,340
Dead folks --
kind of my thing.

358
00:20:49,342 --> 00:20:51,176
So...

359
00:20:51,178 --> 00:20:53,411
spill.

360
00:20:56,283 --> 00:20:59,584
We're collecting souls
to build a bomb.

361
00:20:59,586 --> 00:21:01,719
To blow the Darkness
to hell.

362
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:06,057
Okay.

363
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:08,259
Okay?

364
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:10,795
Uh, w-what does that mean,
"okay"?

365
00:21:10,797 --> 00:21:13,464
Means
way things are going,

366
00:21:13,466 --> 00:21:16,267
I'm about an hour away
from reaping God himself.

367
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:19,671
So you're here to help us.

368
00:21:20,974 --> 00:21:24,676
Little tip --
you want souls,

369
00:21:24,678 --> 00:21:26,844
call a reaper.

370
00:21:33,286 --> 00:21:35,186
Hiya.

371
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:37,088
Hello.

372
00:21:38,658 --> 00:21:41,025
Oh, I like your dress.

373
00:21:41,027 --> 00:21:44,028
It's pretty fancy
for the park,

374
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,097
but at least
you made an effort.

375
00:21:48,235 --> 00:21:50,168
Do you want to feed them?

376
00:21:53,473 --> 00:21:54,872
I shouldn't.

377
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:01,579
I've been feeding these birds
going on 20 years now.

378
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:03,615
They're practically
family.

379
00:22:03,617 --> 00:22:06,618
And I know that makes me
sound like a crazy old bat,

380
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,787
but...heck.

381
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:12,590
My husband died
a couple of years ago,

382
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:15,460
and my son keeps slipping me
these brochures

383
00:22:15,462 --> 00:22:18,096
for retirement
communities --

384
00:22:18,098 --> 00:22:21,599
a.k.a. where they send
old folks to die,

385
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:24,636
but not to make a fuss
about it.

386
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:26,504
So you hate him.

387
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:29,841
Well, a little bit.

388
00:22:29,843 --> 00:22:31,976
Sometimes.

389
00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:35,179
But you know family.

390
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:39,517
Even when you hate them,
you still love them.

391
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:48,693
Well, this is exciting.

392
00:23:10,684 --> 00:23:13,017
How many souls
are in there?

393
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:15,553
A couple hundred...thousand.

394
00:23:16,756 --> 00:23:18,222
I raided the Veil.

395
00:23:18,224 --> 00:23:21,259
Like I said, dead folks --

396
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:22,860
kind of my thing.

397
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,563
We good?

398
00:23:25,565 --> 00:23:28,066
Very.

399
00:23:28,068 --> 00:23:31,235
Super.

400
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:33,237
See you around.

401
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:36,007
Yeah. You will.

402
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:39,577
Just hope
it's not today.

403
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:40,978
Crowley.

404
00:23:49,122 --> 00:23:50,755
So, what now?

405
00:23:50,757 --> 00:23:53,825
Well, now we have the bomb,
so we just got to find Amara.

406
00:23:53,827 --> 00:23:55,393
I can track her.

407
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:57,095
She's not warded anymore.

408
00:23:57,097 --> 00:23:59,597
Why would she be?

409
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:01,899
She won.

410
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:04,202
Okay, so?

411
00:24:04,204 --> 00:24:05,837
We need somebody
to get close to her,

412
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,605
someone with a...

413
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:10,174
personal connection.

414
00:24:22,021 --> 00:24:25,022
Well, what are we
waiting for?

415
00:24:25,024 --> 00:24:27,291
How do I smuggle
this thing?

416
00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:28,426
We could always
shove it up your --

417
00:24:28,428 --> 00:24:29,794
Hey.

418
00:24:29,796 --> 00:24:31,062
I mean, you could.

419
00:24:31,064 --> 00:24:33,998
You won't carry the bomb.

420
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,834
You'll be the bomb.

421
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:42,173
I'm gonna take
what's in there...

422
00:24:42,175 --> 00:24:45,143
and put it in here.

423
00:24:45,145 --> 00:24:48,780
Once you get close to her,

424
00:24:48,782 --> 00:24:52,917
you press your fingers
together like so --

425
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:54,852
boom.

426
00:24:59,025 --> 00:25:00,792
Okay.

427
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:32,500
Huh!

428
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,520
Dean, are you okay?

429
00:25:35,522 --> 00:25:37,122
How do you feel?

430
00:25:37,124 --> 00:25:40,492
Like my insides
just got flame-broiled.

431
00:25:42,362 --> 00:25:44,362
Is that normal?

432
00:25:44,364 --> 00:25:46,498
Sweetie,
we're so far past normal.

433
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,234
You've got about an hour,
maybe a wee bit more,

434
00:25:49,236 --> 00:25:52,303
then you're literally
a walking ticking time bomb.

435
00:26:07,053 --> 00:26:08,720
Thank you.

436
00:26:11,691 --> 00:26:14,559
Welcome to the States.
Where we headed?

437
00:26:14,561 --> 00:26:16,561
Lebanon, Kansas.

438
00:26:32,846 --> 00:26:35,980
Dean, you know,
you don't have to do this.

439
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,220
'Course I do.

440
00:26:42,222 --> 00:26:44,255
I just have to get close.

441
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:48,026
I can do that, okay?

442
00:26:48,028 --> 00:26:51,196
I can do that.

443
00:26:54,267 --> 00:26:57,001
You know,
if this works, um,

444
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:59,070
that bomb goes off.

445
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:03,374
I know.

446
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,400
You cool with this?

447
00:27:29,402 --> 00:27:31,135
No.

448
00:27:31,137 --> 00:27:33,404
I -- Even after everything
she's done,

449
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:35,006
Amara's still my sister.

450
00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:37,242
She's my family.

451
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:42,080
I can't -- I don't want
to see her dead, but...

452
00:27:42,082 --> 00:27:43,648
Yeah?

453
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,917
...I understand.

454
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,419
Dean.

455
00:27:50,323 --> 00:27:51,956
Cass.

456
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:52,991
Okay.

457
00:27:52,993 --> 00:27:54,225
Okay.

458
00:27:54,227 --> 00:27:55,460
All right.

459
00:27:59,165 --> 00:28:00,765
I could go with you.

460
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:01,933
No, no, no.

461
00:28:01,935 --> 00:28:04,569
No,
I got to do this alone.

462
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,276
Listen, if -- when --
<i>when</i> this works,

463
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:13,778
Sam --
he's gonna be a mess.

464
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,247
So look out for him,
okay?

465
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:17,782
Make sure he doesn't do
anything stupid.

466
00:28:17,784 --> 00:28:19,250
Of course.

467
00:28:21,288 --> 00:28:23,655
Thank you
for everything.

468
00:28:25,425 --> 00:28:28,059
Okay, look.
I want a big funeral.

469
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:29,694
All right?
I'm talking epic.

470
00:28:29,696 --> 00:28:31,896
Okay?
Open bar, choir,

471
00:28:31,898 --> 00:28:34,966
Sabbath cover band, and
Gary Busey reading the eulogy.

472
00:28:34,968 --> 00:28:37,502
Done.

473
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,504
And for my ashes,
I like it here.

474
00:28:41,942 --> 00:28:43,574
Yeah.

475
00:28:43,576 --> 00:28:47,879
You know, as far as
eternal resting places go.

476
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,331
Come on.
You know the drill.

477
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,599
No chick-flick moments.
Come on.

478
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:15,406
Yeah, you love chick flicks.

479
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,510
Yeah, you're right.
I do. Come here.

480
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,890
Okay.
Let's do this.

481
00:30:12,732 --> 00:30:14,599
He's not wrong.

482
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:20,738
One little apocalypse
and they shut up shop.

483
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,273
Quitters.

484
00:30:27,614 --> 00:30:30,415
Your round, Moose.

485
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,186
Dean.

486
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:40,792
How did you find me?

487
00:30:43,263 --> 00:30:44,796
Does it matter?

488
00:30:46,332 --> 00:30:48,966
I'm here to give you
what you want.

489
00:30:48,968 --> 00:30:50,968
Me.

490
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,005
That's a change.

491
00:30:55,308 --> 00:30:58,876
Well, I can't just stand by
and watch the world,

492
00:30:58,878 --> 00:31:03,247
my friends,
and my family die.

493
00:31:03,249 --> 00:31:06,551
So if becoming
a part of you

494
00:31:06,553 --> 00:31:08,853
takes me away from that,
then I'm in.

495
00:31:08,855 --> 00:31:11,022
You...

496
00:31:11,024 --> 00:31:13,658
and that bomb
in your chest?

497
00:31:16,696 --> 00:31:19,263
Do you think I can't taste
the power coming off of you?

498
00:31:19,265 --> 00:31:21,532
Please.

499
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:25,369
The problem is you've never
been able to hurt me.

500
00:31:25,371 --> 00:31:28,005
So what makes this time
any different?

501
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:31,609
I don't have a choice.

502
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:33,711
What you're doing
to the sun --

503
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:35,146
That's not me.

504
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:39,517
With my brother
getting weaker,

505
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,221
the scales are tipping away
from light.

506
00:31:43,223 --> 00:31:45,656
And into darkness.

507
00:31:45,658 --> 00:31:46,858
Into nothing.

508
00:31:48,561 --> 00:31:50,828
When God's gone,
the universe --

509
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,731
everything
will cease to exist.

510
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:56,267
Including me.

511
00:31:56,269 --> 00:32:00,404
<i>And while law enforcement</i>
<i>is telling people not to panic,</i>

512
00:32:00,406 --> 00:32:02,940
<i>residents are being advised</i>
<i>to stay in their homes</i>

513
00:32:02,942 --> 00:32:05,576
<i>as authorities are baffled</i>
<i>by this st--</i>

514
00:32:05,578 --> 00:32:07,578
Boring.

515
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:12,083
He looks horrible.

516
00:32:15,488 --> 00:32:18,022
My brother betrayed me.

517
00:32:18,024 --> 00:32:20,525
He locked me away
for billions of years.

518
00:32:20,527 --> 00:32:22,360
He sent you
to execute me.

519
00:32:22,362 --> 00:32:24,162
No, no. No.

520
00:32:24,164 --> 00:32:27,064
He zapped me here, yes,
but he didn't want this.

521
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:29,267
This wasn't his idea.

522
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:31,702
You're family.
He doesn't want you dead.

523
00:32:31,704 --> 00:32:34,172
He doesn't want
any of this!

524
00:32:39,345 --> 00:32:42,180
? Don't let the sun ?

525
00:32:42,182 --> 00:32:45,917
? Catch you crying ?

526
00:32:47,687 --> 00:32:50,821
? The night's the time ?
Hey, Chuck.

527
00:32:50,823 --> 00:32:54,792
? For all your tears ?
How you holding up?

528
00:32:54,794 --> 00:32:56,961
Oh, aces.

529
00:32:56,963 --> 00:32:59,564
? Your heart may be broken... ?

530
00:32:59,566 --> 00:33:00,898
Is this what you wanted?

531
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,999
No!

532
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:05,136
I just wanted
to hurt him.

533
00:33:05,138 --> 00:33:07,572
I wanted to make him pay.

534
00:33:07,574 --> 00:33:09,407
Yeah, that's revenge.

535
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:12,276
It'll get you out of bed
in the morning,

536
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:15,880
and when you get it,
it feels great...

537
00:33:15,882 --> 00:33:18,382
for about five minutes.

538
00:33:20,153 --> 00:33:21,419
I've been there.

539
00:33:21,421 --> 00:33:24,488
Me and Sam --

540
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,724
we have had our fair share
of fights --

541
00:33:26,726 --> 00:33:28,426
more than our share --

542
00:33:28,428 --> 00:33:30,995
but no matter
how bad it got,

543
00:33:30,997 --> 00:33:32,697
we always made it right

544
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:35,466
<i>because</i> we're family.

545
00:33:35,468 --> 00:33:37,235
I need him.

546
00:33:37,237 --> 00:33:38,603
He needs me.

547
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:40,738
And when everything
goes to crap,

548
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,041
that's all you've got --
family.

549
00:33:44,043 --> 00:33:48,646
Now you might be a --
an all-powerful being...

550
00:33:48,648 --> 00:33:50,615
but I think you're human
where it counts.

551
00:33:50,617 --> 00:33:52,583
You simply need
your brother.

552
00:33:52,585 --> 00:33:54,952
Just stop.

553
00:33:54,954 --> 00:33:57,121
You don't want
to be alone.

554
00:33:57,123 --> 00:33:59,357
Not really.

555
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,426
I mean, hell.
Maybe that's why you wanted me.

556
00:34:02,428 --> 00:34:06,063
But deep down, you didn't
really want me...

557
00:34:06,065 --> 00:34:08,566
'cause I'm not him.

558
00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:10,568
So maybe I <i>can</i> kill you.

559
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:13,571
Or maybe I can't.

560
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:16,807
Maybe if I pull this trigger,
we all live happily ever after,

561
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:20,678
or maybe we die bloody,
or maybe it doesn't matter,

562
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,547
because maybe
there's a different way.

563
00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:25,783
So I'm gonna
ask you again.

564
00:34:25,785 --> 00:34:28,786
Put aside the rage.
Put aside the hate.

565
00:34:28,788 --> 00:34:32,189
And you tell me...

566
00:34:32,191 --> 00:34:34,859
what do you want?

567
00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:40,765
You know, we, um...

568
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:43,167
we need you
to try and hang in there

569
00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:45,136
just a little longer.

570
00:34:45,138 --> 00:34:49,273
? But don't forget that love's a game ?
I know. I'm trying.

571
00:34:49,275 --> 00:34:52,643
? And it can always
come again ?

572
00:34:52,645 --> 00:34:54,445
I'm gonna go get
you some water.

573
00:34:54,447 --> 00:35:02,820
? Oh, don't let the sun
catch you crying ?

574
00:35:02,822 --> 00:35:05,690
? Don't let the sun
catch you crying ?

575
00:35:05,692 --> 00:35:07,124
? Oh, no ?

576
00:35:07,126 --> 00:35:09,660
? Oh, whoa, whoa ?

577
00:35:09,662 --> 00:35:11,662
Chuck?

578
00:35:11,664 --> 00:35:13,431
What?

579
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:15,966
Chuck?!

580
00:35:15,968 --> 00:35:18,502
Why did you
bring me here?

581
00:35:18,504 --> 00:35:19,870
Brother, I...

582
00:35:25,878 --> 00:35:29,714
In the beginning...

583
00:35:29,716 --> 00:35:32,616
it was just you and me,

584
00:35:32,618 --> 00:35:35,586
and we were family.

585
00:35:37,123 --> 00:35:40,324
I loved you,
and I thought --

586
00:35:40,326 --> 00:35:42,860
I <i>knew...</i>

587
00:35:42,862 --> 00:35:44,462
that you loved me.

588
00:35:44,464 --> 00:35:46,230
I did.

589
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,033
I do.

590
00:35:49,035 --> 00:35:53,804
But then you went and you made
all these other things.

591
00:35:53,806 --> 00:35:56,340
I hated them.

592
00:35:56,342 --> 00:35:59,510
I hated you for needing
something else,

593
00:35:59,512 --> 00:36:01,045
something that wasn't me.

594
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:05,783
And then
you locked me away,

595
00:36:05,785 --> 00:36:09,620
and all I could think about
was making you suffer.

596
00:36:09,622 --> 00:36:12,757
You had your reasons.

597
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:15,259
I did.

598
00:36:15,261 --> 00:36:18,963
And I thought revenge
would make me happy.

599
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:21,031
But I was wrong.

600
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:31,642
What you've made...

601
00:36:31,644 --> 00:36:34,445
it's beautiful.

602
00:36:35,748 --> 00:36:38,849
It took me a long time
to see that.

603
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:42,887
I know that we can't go back
to the way things were.

604
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:45,856
I don't want to,

605
00:36:45,858 --> 00:36:47,691
but I wish...

606
00:36:49,796 --> 00:36:54,598
I wish that we could just
be family again.

607
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,067
I do too.

608
00:37:42,815 --> 00:37:43,981
He did it.

609
00:37:43,983 --> 00:37:45,883
He bloody did it.

610
00:37:45,885 --> 00:37:48,419
And Dean?

611
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:25,545
I think we're just gonna go away
for a while and...

612
00:38:25,547 --> 00:38:27,480
Hey, yeah.
Family meeting.

613
00:38:27,482 --> 00:38:28,648
I get it.

614
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:32,619
But first...

615
00:38:46,635 --> 00:38:48,535
Better?

616
00:38:51,106 --> 00:38:53,640
What about us?

617
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:55,575
What about Earth?

618
00:38:55,577 --> 00:38:57,510
Earth will be fine.

619
00:38:57,512 --> 00:38:59,346
It's got you...

620
00:38:59,348 --> 00:39:01,548
and Sam.

621
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:14,861
Dean, you gave me
what I needed most.

622
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:19,999
I want to do
the same for you.

623
00:39:53,368 --> 00:39:56,669
Sam, I'm so sorry.

624
00:39:56,671 --> 00:39:59,773
If you want to talk...

625
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:01,708
I'm here
if you need anything.

626
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,510
Hello, hello.

627
00:40:09,484 --> 00:40:10,917
Cass!

628
00:40:11,753 --> 00:40:14,220
Don't.

629
00:40:14,222 --> 00:40:16,022
Sam Winchester.

630
00:40:16,024 --> 00:40:17,524
Toni Bevell.

631
00:40:17,526 --> 00:40:19,225
Men of Letters,
London Chapterhouse.

632
00:40:19,227 --> 00:40:23,430
Oh, you won't have heard
of me -- us.

633
00:40:23,432 --> 00:40:24,664
We're very traditional.

634
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:26,699
Keep out of the way,
keep to our studies.

635
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:28,368
You, um...

636
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,602
What?

637
00:40:29,604 --> 00:40:31,237
They sent me
to take you in.

638
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:33,006
To take me in?

639
00:40:33,008 --> 00:40:36,576
Assuming the world didn't end,
and -- Yay.

640
00:40:36,578 --> 00:40:39,112
Look, lady --

641
00:40:39,114 --> 00:40:41,714
We've been
watching you, Sam.

642
00:40:41,716 --> 00:40:44,417
What you've done,
the damage you've caused --

643
00:40:44,419 --> 00:40:46,286
archangels, Leviathans,
the Darkness,

644
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:47,821
and now, well --

645
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:50,356
the old men have decided
enough's enough.

646
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:52,525
I mean,
let's face it, Sam.

647
00:40:52,527 --> 00:40:54,060
You're just
a jumped-up hunter

648
00:40:54,062 --> 00:40:55,829
playing with things
you don't understand

649
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:57,464
and doing more harm
than good.

650
00:40:57,466 --> 00:41:00,767
Now, where's Dean?

651
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:03,970
Dead.

652
00:41:06,308 --> 00:41:08,708
Listen, lady.

653
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,677
I don't know who the hell
you are

654
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:12,612
or what the hell you want --
Stop.

655
00:41:12,614 --> 00:41:14,714
Put the gun down.

656
00:41:14,716 --> 00:41:16,416
I said stop.

657
00:41:16,418 --> 00:41:18,418
You and I both know you're not
gonna pull the trigger.

658
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,653
[ Gunshot ]

659
00:41:26,495 --> 00:41:28,661
Come on.

660
00:41:28,663 --> 00:41:30,730
Where the hell am I?

661
00:41:30,732 --> 00:41:32,799
Help!

662
00:41:32,801 --> 00:41:35,335
Help me!

663
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,386
Mom?
