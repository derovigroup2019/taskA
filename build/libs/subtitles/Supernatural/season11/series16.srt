355
00:16:05,695 --> 00:16:08,096
This is my partner,
Special Agent Rizer.

356
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:10,231
This is Dr. Richards.
Now, she's retired, but --

357
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:11,866
I still have friends
on staff here,

358
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:13,968
so when I heard
that two family members

359
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,904
had lapsed
into unexplained comas,

360
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:18,673
I came in
to see if I could help.

361
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:19,974
So, you were here
when this happened before?

362
00:16:19,976 --> 00:16:21,509
Yes.

363
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:24,779
Two FBI agents spoke to me
about that case, too.

364
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:26,648
Dr. Richards:
Mary Henderson went home

365
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,216
to get
her son's favorite doll.

366
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:30,285
When she didn't answer
any calls,

367
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:32,353
her husband phoned
the police.

368
00:16:32,355 --> 00:16:33,488
They found her.

369
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,756
And she's...

370
00:16:34,758 --> 00:16:36,057
Same as her son.

371
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:38,326
Weird mark on the ankle.
That's it.

372
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:41,296
So, it's
some kind of coma?

373
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:43,865
None like
I've ever seen.

374
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:45,433
How do you mean?

375
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:48,636
Well, their vitals are
fading rapidly.

376
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:50,805
If they don't show
some signs of rallying soon,

377
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:52,540
I'm worried
we may lose them.

378
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:56,578
Sam:
So, what happened?

379
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,113
What happened?
I have no idea.

380
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:01,483
Dr. Richards: The next day,
mother and son woke up,

381
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:03,251
both perfectly fine.

382
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:05,386
Obviously, I hope
the same thing happens here,

383
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:07,155
but these two...

384
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:10,225

as well, so...

Okay.

00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:23,772
that found Mary Henderson
back in the day

392
00:17:23,796 --> 00:17:25,796
and brought
her to this hospital.

393
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:28,443

still around?

about what happened

Next thing you know,
I woke up in the hospital,

405
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:59,841
and one
of the FBI agents told me

406
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:02,777
to never touch the wallpaper
in the sitting room.

407

When I was in the coma,
I had a dream.

411
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:16,691
I mean, it was
more like a nightmare.

412
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:18,092
It was...

413
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:21,796
like I was in the house,
but it wasn't the house.

414
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,434
Everything was dark.

415
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:28,369
And it looked faded.

416
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:30,071
And at first,
I was alone,

417
00:18:30,073 --> 00:18:33,207
but then I-I started
to see things.

418
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:35,143
What did you see
exactly?

419
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:37,111
My husband.

420
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:38,713
He was dead.

421
00:18:38,715 --> 00:18:42,550
I closed my eyes,
and when I opened them...

422
00:18:42,552 --> 00:18:44,886
he was gone.

423
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:46,754
I tried to leave the house,
but I couldn't,

424
00:18:46,756 --> 00:18:50,058
and then that's
when I started to see them.

425
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:52,594
Spirits or something.
I don't know.

426
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:54,762
Like I said,
it's all...faded now.

427
00:18:54,764 --> 00:18:59,267
It was just...
a bad dream.

428
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:02,103
And what happened
when you woke up?

429
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:05,106
Well, we tried
to move on, you know?

430
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:07,942
But I couldn't shake
the bad feeling.

431
00:19:07,944 --> 00:19:09,911
So we put the house
up for sale.

432
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:12,280
Then, the market crashed.

433
00:19:12,282 --> 00:19:15,249
So, finally, we just walked
on the mortgage...

434
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:19,287
which is why we now rent
and probably will forever.

00:20:56,453 --> 00:21:01,355
Undead creature that feeds
on souls, hence the name.

452
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:05,993
They exist in a place
between our world and another.

453
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:08,496
A Soul Eater moves
into a house, and once it does,

454
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:11,933
it makes what the lore refers to
as a Nest.

455

outside of time and space”"

but it wasn't her house --
She was in The Nest.

The Soul Eaters aren't
really here or there,

462
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:28,850
but apparently
they can muster enough strength

00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,356

as the vic's in The Nest,

466

and her son?

469
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,931
Apparently, The Nest messes
with their victim's head,

470
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:46,701
shows them things they love,
parts of their soul in distress.

471
00:21:46,703 --> 00:21:49,170

And the Soul Eater...

476
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:01,949
closes up The Nest
and moves on to the next house.

477
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:04,719
What happens to the remains
of the souls in The Nest?

478
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:06,654
Well, they wither, too,

479

with the Soul Eater,

00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:11,425

481
00:22:11,427 --> 00:22:13,327

But I'm pretty sure
they can be trapped.

490
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:34,749
It was a case down
in Goodlettsville, Tennessee.

491
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:36,317
Bobby got a call
from another hunter,

492
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,485
a guy named Harvey.

493
00:22:37,487 --> 00:22:39,487
Uh, he was hunting a case.

494
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:41,756
House was rumored to be
chock-full of poltergeists.

495
00:22:41,758 --> 00:22:43,624
But he couldn't find
the bones to burn,

496
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:45,393
so he calls Bobby
for backup.

497
00:22:45,395 --> 00:22:46,861
Bobby hightails it
down there.

498
00:22:46,863 --> 00:22:49,564
He goes into the house,
buckshots, guns blazing.

499
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:51,465
No, no, no, no, no!

500
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:54,402
Do not tell me
how you tell it.

501
00:22:54,404 --> 00:22:56,304
Tell me
how it really happened.

502
00:22:56,306 --> 00:22:59,106
I stepped one foot
inside that house

503
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:00,808
and filled my drawers.

504
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:04,345
You could feel
the badness, Rufus.

505
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:07,715

in a coma.

506
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:09,150
I tried to help,

507
00:23:09,152 --> 00:23:12,186
but it looked like
he'd been there for days.

508
00:23:12,188 --> 00:23:14,522
And then,
I heard footsteps.

509
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:17,758
I was trapped.

510
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,062
But I had
this old Celtic sigil.

511
00:23:21,064 --> 00:23:23,497
Sort of a...

512
00:23:23,499 --> 00:23:26,200
“break glass in case
of emergency” sort of thing.

513
00:23:26,202 --> 00:23:28,970
Supposed to trap monsters,
but to be honest,

514
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:31,205
the damn thing
never worked before.

515
00:23:31,207 --> 00:23:34,675
But it was all I had,
so I started.

516
00:23:34,677 --> 00:23:36,878
And this house is
bad juju?

517
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,981
It just got
a hell of a lot worse.

518
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:42,683
Then, I finished the sigil,
and once I did,

519
00:23:42,685 --> 00:23:44,385
the house went back
to normal.

520
00:23:44,387 --> 00:23:46,454
And, um...

521
00:23:46,456 --> 00:23:48,055
Harv?

522
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:51,559
He never did wake up.

523
00:23:55,331 --> 00:23:57,899
Yeah, well...

525
00:24:01,404 --> 00:24:03,938
Oldest rule.

526
00:24:08,544 --> 00:24:12,880
So, uh, you actually trapped
a Soul Eater?

527
00:24:12,882 --> 00:24:14,849
Bobby and Rufus put up
their sigil
