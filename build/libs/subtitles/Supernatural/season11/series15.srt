1
00:00:01,556 --> 00:00:02,556
Can you really beat her?

2
00:00:02,925 --> 00:00:04,058
I can.

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,593
Then yes.

4
00:00:05,595 --> 00:00:07,561
Dean, that's not Cass!

5
00:00:07,563 --> 00:00:08,729
Cat's out.

6
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:11,165
- Lucifer.
- Lucifer.

7
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:15,102
We have had a coward and a fool
at the helm for too long.

8
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:17,104
I'm still your master.

9
00:00:17,106 --> 00:00:18,973
Did I let you out of that kettle
too soon?

10
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:21,008
What treasonous thoughts
do you have

11
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,376
brewing in that
little head of yours?

12
00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:23,744
If you thought
you could beat Amara,

13
00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:24,979
you'd be taking the fight
to her.

14
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:26,247
You're not strong enough.

15
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,316
I may be
a bit under-equipped.

16
00:00:29,318 --> 00:00:31,318
Did you know
the Nazis had a special branch

17
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,686
devoted to archaeology?

18
00:00:32,688 --> 00:00:33,988
What is that,
<i>mon amour?</i>

19
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,690
And they speak of
a super weapon.

20
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:38,092
Yeah?
What was it?

21
00:00:38,094 --> 00:00:39,760
The Hand of God.

22
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:41,195
From Men of Letters
to Men of Letters,

23
00:00:41,197 --> 00:00:42,963
I'm fighting a war
in the future.

24
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:44,431
It's not like your war.

25
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:47,168
It's big, biblical,
and I need your weapon to win.

26
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,702
Dean's the one
with the link to Amara,

27
00:00:48,704 --> 00:00:50,938
why have I been
trying to spare you?

28
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,273
It's kicked.

29
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:53,741
Who'd have thought
the Hand of God

30
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:56,510
would turn out to be
a one-hitter.

31
00:00:56,512 --> 00:00:58,412
This is a barn burner, folks.

32
00:00:58,414 --> 00:01:00,014
Off the ropes.

33
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:01,582
Picks him up and --

34
00:01:01,584 --> 00:01:04,852
oh, it's a back breaker.

35
00:01:05,788 --> 00:01:07,488
Oh, but only a two count.

36
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,159
The rookie, Shawn Harley, fails
to take “The Hangman” down.

37
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:14,428
Ooh.
A stinger to the neck.

38
00:01:15,998 --> 00:01:18,632
Are you seriously drunk
right now?

39
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:21,368
Just shut up
and get ready.

40
00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:24,104
Ooh, and it's a stinger
to the back.

41
00:01:24,106 --> 00:01:26,340
He's going in.

42
00:01:26,342 --> 00:01:27,875
Takes him to the turnbuckle.

43
00:01:27,877 --> 00:01:28,876
Yeah!

44
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:34,081
Oh, and we know
what's coming next.

45
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,749
Bring it on, baby!

46
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:37,351
It's all over.

47
00:01:37,353 --> 00:01:39,987
I'm gonna hang his ass.

48
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,425
Oh, yeah, baby.

49
00:01:44,427 --> 00:01:47,027
It's all over now, folks.

50
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:49,029
We have lift-off.

51
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:51,999
As Harley
struggling to breathe now.

52
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:53,734
He's turning blue.

53
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:54,969
Yeah!

54
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:01,408
Hey,
has anyone seen my rope?

55
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:04,411
What the hell?
I almost died out there.

56
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:05,679
Harley, back off.

57
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:07,248
You're gonna take
the wino's side? Really?

58
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,482
That's not what this is --

59
00:02:08,484 --> 00:02:09,917
Whatever.

60
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,852
You old-timers like to
stick together, right?

61
00:02:13,356 --> 00:02:15,389
Well, do us a favor --

62
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:17,191
keep a leash on your boy

63
00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:18,892
or he might get hurt.

64
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:21,929
?

65
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:37,778
Hey!

00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,490

00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:02,736
Hey,
have you seen the, um...

69
00:03:02,738 --> 00:03:04,571
Ah. Yeah.
Thanks.

70
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:06,974
Yeah, bottoms up.

71
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:09,243
Yeah.

72
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:11,378
What's with the bag?

73
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,780
Oh.

74
00:03:12,782 --> 00:03:15,382
You remember
Top Notch wrestling?

75
00:03:15,384 --> 00:03:16,450
Yeah.

76
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:17,785
Those, uh, wrestling shows

77
00:03:17,787 --> 00:03:19,787
dad took us to
when we were kids.

78
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:21,055
Right.

79
00:03:21,057 --> 00:03:23,357
Came across an obituary
last night.

80
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:25,259
Larry “The Hangman” Lee
died.

81
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:27,094
Oh, no.

82
00:03:27,096 --> 00:03:29,229
- Wasn't he, uh --
- He was dad's favorite.

83
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:30,764
Every time that noose
would come out,

84
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:32,099
dad would be up
on his feet.

85
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:33,767
Yeah, that was
one of the few times

86
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:35,235
I ever saw him
actually happy.

87
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:36,770
Yeah.
I remember that.

88
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:39,440
Anyway, the, uh, funeral's
less than a day's drive.

89
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:42,076
I say
we go pay our respects.

90
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:43,577
Uh...

91
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,879
Don't you think o-our plates
are a little full?

92
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:48,749
I mean, it's bad out there,
Dean.

93
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:50,818
Yeah, Sam.
You think I don't know that?

94
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,220
We've done nothing
but mainline lore for a week, okay?

95
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:55,956
We've got Jack on another
hand of God and Amara,

96
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,058
and we've got even less Jack
on how to save Cass.

97
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,493
If he wants to be saved.

98
00:03:59,495 --> 00:04:01,895
He does...

99
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:04,331
Even if
he doesn't know it yet.

100
00:04:05,468 --> 00:04:07,201
- Dean --
- I'm burnt, man.

101
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:08,635
Okay?

102
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:14,541
And I need --
we need to get out of here.

103
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:17,778
Let's go
stretch our legs.

104
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:28,422
?

105
00:04:28,424 --> 00:04:30,657
Oh, good.

106
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:32,393
Yes.

107
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:35,195
Remember, A-B-C --

108
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:38,332
“always be closing.”

109
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:40,267
the sooner
you little storm clouds

110
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:44,471
find me another Hand of God,
the happier I will be.

111
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:46,440
You want me to be happy,
don't you, Dollface?

112
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:50,177
Of course, my Lord.

113
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:52,880
Good answer.

114
00:04:54,049 --> 00:04:55,516
All right.

115
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:59,953
You're gonna look high,
look low, far and wide.

116
00:04:59,955 --> 00:05:02,489
Search every warehouse,
every farmhouse,

117
00:05:02,491 --> 00:05:05,225
every henhouse, outhouse,
and doghouse.

118
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:07,828
?

119
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:15,068
What about you,
little puppy?

120
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,438
You have something
to add?

121
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:20,240
Nothing, master.

122
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:25,813
Really?

123
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:27,948
I would tell you.
I swear.

124
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:30,951
I believe you.

125
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:37,357
May I return to my task?

126
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:39,460
Oh, of course.

127
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:41,962
Ah, ah.

128
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:47,267
Just one minor tweak.

129
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:51,572
Use your tongue.

130
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:54,775
?

131
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:22,302
Dude, check it out.

132
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:24,638
It's “The Scream”
Casey Lyons.

133
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,873
Oh, yeah.

134
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,809
There's
Wrecking Ball Calhoon.

135
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:31,712
Wow.
The Brooklyn Beast?

136
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:33,480
What happened to 'em?

137
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:35,549
They're all...Broken.

138
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:41,522
Dude. Dude.

139
00:06:41,524 --> 00:06:44,258
Gunnar freakin' Lawless.

140
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,460
Hmm.
Groupie much?

141
00:06:46,462 --> 00:06:47,629
Shut up.

142
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,545
Should I go say hi?

143
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:50,431
I should go say hi.
I'm gonna go say hi.

144
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:54,067
I know it's hard.
All right, take care.

145
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:56,370
Hi, s-sir.

146
00:06:56,372 --> 00:06:58,805
I, uh, saw you --
saw you standing over here

147
00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:01,975
and told my brother that I-I
should come over and say hi,

148
00:07:01,977 --> 00:07:05,812
so I came over
and, uh...

149
00:07:05,814 --> 00:07:07,514
Hi.

150
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:09,349
Gunnar Lawless.

151
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:10,784
Oh, I know.

152
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:12,853
Man,
I-I got to tell you.

153
00:07:12,855 --> 00:07:14,187
I...

154
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:15,856
Worshiped you,
growing up.

155
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:18,592
Thanks.
I plan on keeping that hand.

156
00:07:18,594 --> 00:07:20,160
Oh, sorry.

157
00:07:20,162 --> 00:07:22,396
You know, when I was --
when I was 10,

158
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:24,298
I got my first B&E

159
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,500
from borrowing some family's
pay-per-view

160
00:07:26,502 --> 00:07:28,335
so that I could
watch the cage match

161
00:07:28,337 --> 00:07:30,170
between you
and the Tower of Power.

162
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:32,706
I'm not sure
how I feel about

163
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,975
contributing to
your juvenile delinquency,

164
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:36,910
but appreciate it
all the same.

165
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:40,080
Yeah, uh...
You were robbed, by the way.

166
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:43,350
You bet your ass I was.

167
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:45,786
Oh, yes.

168
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:49,122
Hey.

169
00:07:49,124 --> 00:07:51,191
You're Rio.

170
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:53,994
Y-you used to manage
Superbomb Sanchez, right?

171
00:07:53,996 --> 00:07:56,363
Oh.
That was a long time ago.

172
00:07:56,365 --> 00:08:00,434
Well, yeah,
b-but you -- you...

173
00:08:02,037 --> 00:08:03,870
You look great.

174
00:08:03,872 --> 00:08:06,540
Sorry. Uh...

175
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,542
Wrong place.

176
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:11,678
It's just
y-you were my -- my first crush.

177
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,180
Ah. You weren't
one of those guys

178
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:15,248
that had my poster
above his bed, were you?

179
00:08:16,752 --> 00:08:19,620
What?
No.

180
00:08:22,091 --> 00:08:23,423
Are you still managing?

181
00:08:23,425 --> 00:08:24,858
Oh. Nah.

182
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,927
I call some matches
sometimes,

183
00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:30,097
but I'm mostly
behind the curtain, you know,

184
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:34,601
booking the shows
and taking care of the guys.

185
00:08:34,603 --> 00:08:37,638
Yeah.
Must be hard to see one go.

186
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,440
Yeah, well...

187
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:42,509
We spent a lot of time
on the road together.

188
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:44,277
We're like family,

189
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:48,649
and lately, I've seen too many
of my boys be put in the dirt.

190
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:52,986
I knew Hangman
for 25 years.

191
00:08:52,988 --> 00:08:54,621
He was a good man.

192
00:08:54,623 --> 00:08:56,890
Great family.

193
00:08:56,892 --> 00:08:59,159
I just can't believe
he would do this.

194
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:02,896
Do what?

195
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:05,132
Kill himself.

196
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:07,134
Wait.
That wasn't in the obituary.

197
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:10,971
Ah, the family didn't
want that advertised,

198
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:12,406
so...

199
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:15,108
Speaking of which,
if you'll excuse me.

200
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:20,480
Poor son of a bitch.

201
00:09:20,482 --> 00:09:22,315
Yeah.

202
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:24,918
You know, uh, word is --

203
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,554
Yeah. I heard.

204
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:29,956
Hey, you know they're having
a memorial show tonight?

205
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,692
And I know you're itching
to get back, but, uh --

206
00:09:31,694 --> 00:09:33,727
We should go to it.

207
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:35,128
Really?

208
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,530
Why not?

209
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:37,958
World's still gonna be screwed
tomorrow, right?

210
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:39,746
Yeah.

211
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,770
The Brooklyn Beast returns
against Rush

212
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,005
in an epic Iron Man matchup!
All right.

213
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:47,708
Let me hear you
make some noise.

214
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,343
Are you ready?

215
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:56,650
You know, I remember
the Top Notch shows being...

216
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:58,385
Grander, you know?
Top-notch.

217
00:09:58,387 --> 00:10:00,120
Yeah.
Well, you drink enough,

218
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:02,389
it'll be
just like old times.

219
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:08,628
Rio.

220
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,163
- You dog.
- Oh, shut up.

221
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:12,199
Dude, we met at the wake.
She's nice.

222
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:13,500
Did you tell you used to
have a poster of her

223
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:14,868
over your bed
when you were a kid?

224
00:10:16,338 --> 00:10:17,637
No.

225
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:19,372
- Yeah.
- Get this.

226
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:22,109
Guy at the wake told me they're
only making 25 bucks tonight.

227
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:24,111
- That's it?
- Yeah.

228
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:26,546
Now,
that hardly seems worth it.

229
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:27,914
Yeah, think about that.

230
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,282
Town after town,
putting your ass on the line

231
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:30,751
for next to nothing?

232
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:33,086
No money. No glory.

233
00:10:33,088 --> 00:10:34,521
Wow.

234
00:10:34,523 --> 00:10:37,758
You realize you just
literally described our jobs.

235
00:10:39,228 --> 00:10:40,694
Whoa.
Excuse me, fellas.

236
00:10:40,696 --> 00:10:42,028
- It's all right.
- It's all right.

237
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,164
- This is gonna be great.
- Yeah.

238
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,932
Got to love some rasslin',
am I right?

239
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:46,867
Yeah.

240
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:48,835
?

241
00:10:48,837 --> 00:10:51,671
Beer's cheap,
kid's entertained --

242
00:10:51,673 --> 00:10:53,306
parenting.

243
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:56,643
Remember, don't tell mom
how many I've had.

244
00:10:56,645 --> 00:10:58,979
Yeah.
Now, <i>that</i> brings me back.

245
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:02,149
You want to
not try and ruin

246
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:03,750
one of the nicest things
dad ever did for us, please?

247
00:11:03,752 --> 00:11:04,918
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Thank you.

248
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,386
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

249
00:11:06,388 --> 00:11:10,257
...put your hands together
for Hellrazor!

250
00:11:19,168 --> 00:11:21,101
Almost showtime.

251
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:25,305
Got a little something
for ya.

252
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:29,342
?

253
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:39,352
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

254
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:44,624
put your hands together
for Gunnar Lawless!

255
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:46,026
Yeah!

256
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:49,596
Oh, yeah!

257
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:55,635
Oh, yeah!

258
00:11:56,772 --> 00:11:58,104
Right?! Right?!

259
00:11:59,374 --> 00:12:01,241
Hey, get up.
Show some respect.

260
00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:04,244
Who's getting it?
Who's getting it, huh?

261
00:12:04,246 --> 00:12:05,478
Oh, oh, remember this?

262
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,847
This is where
he takes a glove off

263
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:08,915
and gives it to some kid
before the match?

264
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:11,384
Whoo!

265
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:12,919
Huh?

266
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:15,021
Oh, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

267
00:12:15,023 --> 00:12:16,223
Cool.

268
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:21,862
Okay.

269
00:12:21,864 --> 00:12:23,063
Maybe next time.

270
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:25,465
It's all right.
I'm not a child.

271
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,234
It's fine.

272
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:32,305
Big foot to the face!

273
00:12:32,307 --> 00:12:34,708
Lawless
up on the ropes now.

274
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:44,951
Get up!

275
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:46,219
Get up, buddy.

276
00:12:46,221 --> 00:12:47,420
Come on, man.

277
00:12:47,422 --> 00:12:49,589
You can do it, Gunnar.

278
00:12:49,591 --> 00:12:51,258
Get up, buddy.

279
00:13:03,805 --> 00:13:05,438
Come on, man.

280
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:08,742
Get out of it!

281
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:11,511
Gunnar!

282
00:13:22,824 --> 00:13:25,558
?

283
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:34,301
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

284
00:13:34,303 --> 00:13:37,570
Up and over!
Up and over!

285
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:42,609
Oh!

286
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:44,577
1, 2, 3!

287
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:52,552
I got to drain the dragon.
Be good.

288
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:55,889
Oh, but it's all over now,
folks.

289
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,108
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

290
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:40,230
All right,
you guys are good.

291
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:44,368
Hey, buddy, try to keep
your head up, okay?

292
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,504
Come on. Let's go.

293
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:50,807
Poor kid.

294
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:52,509
- Yeah.
- What'd they say?

295
00:14:52,511 --> 00:14:54,211
You're not gonna
believe this.

296
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:57,214
The body...was marked.

297
00:14:58,884 --> 00:15:00,384
Wow. By what?

298
00:15:00,386 --> 00:15:02,019
What, he get in a tickle fight
with Edward Scissorhands?

299
00:15:02,021 --> 00:15:04,454
Dude.

300
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:08,125
Look. T-the cuts look
deliberate, you know?

301
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:10,227
- Ritualistic.
- What, you think this is a case?

302
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:11,762
You think it's not?

303
00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:13,230
Okay.
What are you thinking?

304
00:15:13,232 --> 00:15:16,466
I don't know.
A-a witch, maybe?

305
00:15:16,468 --> 00:15:17,968
You know what?

306
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,369
I'll head back to the motel,
look into the symbol.

307
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:22,973
I'll stay here,
shake some trees.

308
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:26,443
?

309
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:31,682
Hello?

310
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:35,552
FBI. I got some questions.

311
00:15:38,624 --> 00:15:40,557
Bueller?

312
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,970
?

313
00:16:00,713 --> 00:16:02,579
Whoo!

314
00:16:07,686 --> 00:16:11,254
Oh, yeah!

315
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:14,257
Nice moves.

316
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:21,431
Oh, my God.
A-are you all right?

317
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:22,632
Yeah, good.

318
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:24,134
Oh.

319
00:16:24,136 --> 00:16:25,602
Uh...

320
00:16:25,604 --> 00:16:29,206
agent, uh, Roussimoff,
FBI.

321
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:32,142
Y-you were at the wake,
weren't you?

322
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:33,710
I was.

323
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:37,314
Yeah, and then the body dropped,
and back on the clock.

324
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:39,783
Did you know
the deceased?

325
00:16:39,785 --> 00:16:42,786
Oh,
I-I sold him some tickets.

326
00:16:42,788 --> 00:16:44,154
He had a kid, right?

327
00:16:44,156 --> 00:16:45,522
Yeah.

328
00:16:47,126 --> 00:16:48,358
Wow.

329
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,327
Maybe my boys are right.

330
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:52,329
Maybe we really are cursed.

331
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:53,964
Cursed?

332
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:56,867
Back in Shreveport,
our first stop on the tour,

333
00:16:56,869 --> 00:17:00,670
a maintenance guy found a body
stashed in a dumpster

334
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:04,041
behind the VFW,
and now this.

335
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:08,478
Could I get a list
of your whole crew?

336
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,680
Wrestlers, roadies,
anybody that you roll with.

337
00:17:10,682 --> 00:17:15,318
Oh, we use locals for
all the setups and concessions.

338
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,287
I can only afford to
travel my boys.

339
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:19,156
And where would they be
right now?

340
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:21,892
Try the nearest bar.

341
00:17:21,894 --> 00:17:23,760
I know
that's where I'll be.

342
00:17:23,762 --> 00:17:25,896
Okay. Thanks.

343
00:17:29,768 --> 00:17:31,068
?

344
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,970
God.

345
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,478
We don't have much time.

346
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,380
I'm getting you
out of here.

347
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:44,714
Now.

348
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:47,784
I can't leave.

349
00:17:47,786 --> 00:17:49,519
You can.
You still have friends --

350
00:17:49,521 --> 00:17:53,590
people who want you back...
Who want Lucifer gone.

351
00:17:56,695 --> 00:17:58,228
I don't know
what he's done to you.

352
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,697
I can't imagine,
but you're --

353
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:04,201
you're not a slave,
a dog.

354
00:18:05,571 --> 00:18:07,170
You're Crowley,

355
00:18:07,172 --> 00:18:09,840
and the Devil should be afraid
of <i>you.</i>

356
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:20,117
?

357
00:18:39,938 --> 00:18:41,404
Hey.

358
00:18:41,406 --> 00:18:42,939
Hey.

359
00:18:45,477 --> 00:18:47,110
Dean, right?

360
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:48,645
Yeah.

361
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:50,547
You enjoy the show?

362
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:52,349
The show was great.

363
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:54,718
Yeah, yeah.
You were great.

364
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,521
After the show, not so much,
but, uh...

365
00:18:57,523 --> 00:18:59,623
Yeah, I heard.

366
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,924
It's a damn shame.

367
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:02,459
Yeah.

368
00:19:05,197 --> 00:19:07,464
That's, uh, kind of
why I'm here.

369
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:09,299
Uh...

370
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,470
Kind of buried the lead
on that one, huh?

371
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:17,040
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

372
00:19:17,042 --> 00:19:20,076
But I hear this isn't the first
murder at a Top Notch show.

373
00:19:20,078 --> 00:19:23,013
It's a rough crowd --
inside the ring and out.

374
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:25,549
Yeah.

375
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:27,817
'92.

376
00:19:30,088 --> 00:19:32,222
I'm leaving the ring
and some damn reprobate

377
00:19:32,224 --> 00:19:35,458
goes at me
with a broken beer bottle.

378
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,960
Wow.

379
00:19:36,962 --> 00:19:39,229
A couple years ago,

380
00:19:39,231 --> 00:19:42,332
a, uh, perp
got the drop on me,

381
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:44,834
decided to take
a chunk of my leg as a keepsake.

382
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:49,239
See this right here?

383
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:51,107
Far as I can bend these

384
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:54,744
thanks to good ol' Jonah Rancid
and all 400 pounds of him

385
00:19:54,746 --> 00:19:56,813
just dropping down on me.

386
00:19:56,815 --> 00:19:58,615
Wow.
Sure thing.

387
00:19:58,617 --> 00:20:01,017
But yet you're still out there,
still doing it.

388
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:04,221
I've been beat up,
spit on,

389
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,189
stabbed, roughed up,

390
00:20:06,191 --> 00:20:10,227
but I will be damned
if I didn't always get back up.

391
00:20:11,663 --> 00:20:13,697
One thing I learned --

392
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:16,733
you got to keep on grinding no
matter what's thrown your way.

393
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:20,837
Damn, you're awesome.

394
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:23,073
Tell that
to my ex-wives.

395
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:30,947
Ah.
Give me a sec.

396
00:20:32,517 --> 00:20:34,718
- Hey, what do you got?
- A lot, actually.

397
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,887
Uh, so every stop
on the Top Notch tour,

398
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:39,022
somebody turned up dead.

399
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:40,490
It didn't all happen
at the venue,

400
00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:42,592
and most of them
look like accidents,

401
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:46,329
but they all had the symbol --
Hangman, too.

402
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:47,764
Well,
I thought he killed himself.

403
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:49,899
Yeah,
that's what Rio said,

404
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:52,035
but the cops are treating it
like an open case.

405
00:20:52,037 --> 00:20:53,770
They're thinking,
and I quote,

406
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:56,706
“It's some kind of
weird satanic crap.”

407
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:57,807
Awesome.

408
00:20:57,809 --> 00:20:59,242
Yeah, it gets better.

409
00:20:59,244 --> 00:21:02,212
That symbol --
ancient Sumerian.

410
00:21:02,214 --> 00:21:05,548
Said to have the power to
“pluck the spark of life.”

411
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,784
and that means?

412
00:21:09,254 --> 00:21:10,587
Souls, maybe?

413
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:12,389
So we're talking demon?

414
00:21:12,391 --> 00:21:13,890
It's worth checking out.

415
00:21:13,892 --> 00:21:16,159
Well, Rio says that they use
locals to set up, so...

416
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:17,794
So it's got to be
one of the wrestlers.

417
00:21:17,796 --> 00:21:19,629
Maybe.

418
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:20,830
All right.
Just get here.

419
00:21:20,832 --> 00:21:21,965
What are you gonna do?

420
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,433
I'm working on it.

421
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:24,901
Yo!

422
00:21:24,903 --> 00:21:26,303
Sweetheart!

423
00:21:26,305 --> 00:21:28,471
Hit me again!

424
00:21:28,473 --> 00:21:29,673
Hey, Harley.

425
00:21:29,675 --> 00:21:31,207
Go easy.
I think you've had enough.

426
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:32,409
Screw off.

427
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:33,943
Just trying to help.

428
00:21:33,945 --> 00:21:35,812
Like you helped me
in Fort Worth?

429
00:21:38,817 --> 00:21:40,417
What?

430
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:43,286
You think I don't know
you got me kicked off the card?

431
00:21:43,288 --> 00:21:46,489
You wouldn't job to Crazy D.,
and I couldn't abide by that.

432
00:21:46,491 --> 00:21:49,059
Yeah.

433
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:52,595
I think
you just can't stand the thought

434
00:21:52,597 --> 00:21:54,764
of me
stealing your thunder.

435
00:21:56,435 --> 00:21:59,836
Kid,
I got no worries about that.

436
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:06,176
All right.

437
00:22:06,178 --> 00:22:07,177
That's enough.

438
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:08,511
Get up, old man.

439
00:22:08,513 --> 00:22:09,846
Or do you need
your go-juice?

440
00:22:09,848 --> 00:22:11,648
What?

441
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,516
That's right.

442
00:22:13,518 --> 00:22:15,418
I saw him and his dealer.

443
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,620
Your golden boy's
a freaking junkie.

444
00:22:17,622 --> 00:22:18,855
He's lying.

445
00:22:18,857 --> 00:22:20,223
- Like hell.
- All right, all right.

446
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:23,360
Harley,
we got two days till Memphis.

447
00:22:23,362 --> 00:22:24,794
Sleep it off.

448
00:22:24,796 --> 00:22:27,464
Gunnar, I'll talk to you
about this tomorrow.

449
00:22:29,868 --> 00:22:31,301
Go.

450
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:33,670
Hey.

451
00:22:33,672 --> 00:22:34,704
Hey.

452
00:22:34,706 --> 00:22:35,772
You okay?

453
00:22:35,774 --> 00:22:37,674
Ah, yeah, yeah.

454
00:22:37,676 --> 00:22:40,210
I've been hit harder
by guys a lot tougher.

455
00:22:40,212 --> 00:22:42,178
- Yeah.
- You got it.

456
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,581
Why, uh -- why didn't you
fight back?

457
00:22:45,717 --> 00:22:47,217
I got nothing to prove.

458
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:49,486
- Yeah.
- Hey.

459
00:22:49,488 --> 00:22:51,688
- You okay, boss?
- Yeah.

460
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,590
Just another day, huh?

461
00:22:56,695 --> 00:22:58,895
Well, hey.
Here's, uh --

462
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:02,232
here's to being the bigger man,
right?

463
00:23:02,234 --> 00:23:04,200
Obliged.

464
00:23:09,608 --> 00:23:13,009
We're gonna need
more shots.

465
00:23:13,011 --> 00:23:14,811
A lot more.

466
00:23:16,415 --> 00:23:18,748
This way.

467
00:23:22,187 --> 00:23:25,021
Uh I wasn't --

468
00:23:25,023 --> 00:23:26,423
she made me.

469
00:23:36,935 --> 00:23:37,934
How did you --

470
00:23:37,936 --> 00:23:39,769
I'm Crowley.

471
00:23:46,845 --> 00:23:49,946
?

472
00:23:57,713 --> 00:23:59,546
Dean?

473
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:02,649
Dean.

474
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:06,453
Hey.

475
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:10,758
Dude, you okay?

476
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,826
Yeah.

477
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:13,561
Ah.

478
00:24:13,563 --> 00:24:14,829
What happened?

479
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,333
Mostly Tequila...

480
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:21,936
Cut with holy water.

481
00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:23,437
I bought drinks
for all the wrestlers,

482
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:25,005
and then, you know,
they're like,

483
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:28,275
“well,
you got to drink, too.”

484
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:33,481
Oh, man, they can drink,
especially Rio.

485
00:24:33,483 --> 00:24:36,484
Ugh. I think I heard my liver
screaming at me.

486
00:24:36,486 --> 00:24:38,552
So, did anyone react?

487
00:24:38,554 --> 00:24:39,820
No.

488
00:24:39,822 --> 00:24:40,955
And you got them all?

489
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:42,723
Uh, except, uh, Harley,

490
00:24:42,725 --> 00:24:43,891
the ultimate douchebag.

491
00:24:43,893 --> 00:24:45,025
He bailed
before I could get to him.

492
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,260
Why is it so bright
in here?

493
00:24:46,262 --> 00:24:48,262
All right.
Let's go find him.

494
00:24:48,264 --> 00:24:50,197
Okay.

495
00:24:54,871 --> 00:24:56,337
Dude!

496
00:24:56,339 --> 00:24:58,606
I'm coming.

497
00:24:58,608 --> 00:25:01,842
?

498
00:25:12,121 --> 00:25:15,022
Harley.

499
00:25:15,024 --> 00:25:16,524
Harley.

500
00:25:33,843 --> 00:25:35,709
Well, that's not good.

501
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:38,546
Uh, ya think?

502
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:41,649
?

503
00:25:47,657 --> 00:25:49,690
My Lord?

504
00:25:49,692 --> 00:25:51,091
That's better.

505
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:54,461
Now let's go find
the ace up my sleeve.

506
00:25:59,468 --> 00:26:02,036
Hey, check this out.
Come here.

507
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:03,203
Got something?

508
00:26:03,205 --> 00:26:05,973
Yeah, uh,
security-cam footage.

509
00:26:05,975 --> 00:26:07,942
All right, let's see
if we got anything.

510
00:26:07,944 --> 00:26:11,312
Um, so this is 1:07 am.
Harley heads to his room.

511
00:26:11,314 --> 00:26:12,713
Um...

512
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,317
- Who's...
- No idea.

513
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,120
But, in there for a few minutes,
and that's Harley.

514
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:21,889
Wow.
He looks knocked out.

515
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:23,157
Yeah.

516
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:24,692
Now, let's see.

517
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:32,333
Lawless?

518
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:36,103
If Harley is a demon, then how
did Gunnar get the drop on him?

519
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,606
Let's find him
and ask him.

520
00:26:55,358 --> 00:26:57,324
Hey!

521
00:26:57,326 --> 00:27:00,027
Help!

522
00:27:01,364 --> 00:27:04,331
Dude,
what the hell is going on?

523
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:08,535
Look.

524
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:11,205
I know I've been a dick,

525
00:27:11,207 --> 00:27:13,240
but I'm sorry, okay?

526
00:27:13,242 --> 00:27:15,542
I took a shot at you.

527
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:17,911
It was a cheap shot.
It was --

528
00:27:17,913 --> 00:27:20,748
it was a cheap-ass shot.

529
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:23,884
And I just...

530
00:27:26,222 --> 00:27:28,055
Just don't hurt me.

531
00:27:28,057 --> 00:27:29,657
Please.

532
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,560
It's not my call.

533
00:27:39,635 --> 00:27:41,101
Hello, Shawn.

534
00:27:46,108 --> 00:27:48,776
I'm your new best friend.

535
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:51,345
Okay, traffic cameras show the
truck heading north on Wilson,

536
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:55,482
past First and Second,
but it never got to third.

537
00:27:55,484 --> 00:27:56,884
Wait a second.
That's -- that's by the --

538
00:27:56,886 --> 00:27:58,385
yeah.

539
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:05,059
You want my what?

540
00:28:05,061 --> 00:28:07,227
Forget what <i>I</i> want.

541
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:08,662
What do <i>you</i> want?

542
00:28:08,664 --> 00:28:13,400
Money? Women? Glory?

543
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:16,270
A big, shiny belt?

544
00:28:16,272 --> 00:28:18,472
Say the word,
and it's yours.

545
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:20,874
Because you're a demon?

546
00:28:20,876 --> 00:28:23,043
Businessman.

547
00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:24,545
Dude,
what the hell is --

548
00:28:24,547 --> 00:28:25,946
Eyes on me, champ.

549
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:28,115
Think about it.

550
00:28:28,117 --> 00:28:31,518
No more crappy motels,
Podunk towns.

551
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,821
You'll have the life
you always wanted --

552
00:28:33,823 --> 00:28:37,091
gumdrops and G-strings
as far as the eye can see.

553
00:28:37,093 --> 00:28:39,960
And all I ask in return
is --

554
00:28:39,962 --> 00:28:41,328
My soul.

555
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,163
And your service.

556
00:28:43,165 --> 00:28:46,133
See, I might
occasionally ask you

557
00:28:46,135 --> 00:28:49,770
to do me a teeny, tiny,
little favor.

558
00:28:49,772 --> 00:28:52,139
What kind of favor?

559
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:54,541
The kill-somebody kind.

560
00:28:55,578 --> 00:28:56,910
Why me?

561
00:28:56,912 --> 00:28:58,378
Because I like you.

562
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,648
You're brash and driven
and hungry.

563
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,250
Yeah.

564
00:29:03,252 --> 00:29:05,085
I'm looking for
new franchisees.

565
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:07,855
Why have one
when I can have two?

566
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,191
You did this?

567
00:29:11,193 --> 00:29:15,896
Gunnar's what I like to call
a satisfied customer.

568
00:29:15,898 --> 00:29:18,599
So...

569
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:20,367
Do we have a deal?

570
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:29,977
No.

571
00:29:32,014 --> 00:29:33,580
Look, man.

572
00:29:33,582 --> 00:29:37,684
I've never been much for
God or whatever.

573
00:29:37,686 --> 00:29:40,020
I sort of just thought that
when your curtain came down,

574
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:41,088
that was it.

575
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,723
Night, night.

576
00:29:45,127 --> 00:29:48,095
But if you're a demon,
that means there's a Hell.

577
00:29:48,097 --> 00:29:51,231
And if there's a Hell,
there is a Heaven.

578
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:53,834
And I'm not giving up
my shot at paradise

579
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:56,236
for a belt
I can win on my own.

580
00:29:58,007 --> 00:29:59,406
That so?

581
00:30:05,915 --> 00:30:07,881
You're talented, Shawn.

582
00:30:07,883 --> 00:30:10,484
But the human body,
it's just so fragile.

583
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,454
One injury,
one wrong step...

584
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:17,524
Like, say, if somebody...

585
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:19,059
severed
your Achilles tendon.

586
00:30:20,896 --> 00:30:22,496
Poof -- you're done.

587
00:30:22,498 --> 00:30:23,831
Duke, no.

588
00:30:37,112 --> 00:30:38,779
You're up.

589
00:30:40,015 --> 00:30:41,448
He's just a kid.

590
00:30:43,586 --> 00:30:44,952
Do it.

591
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:59,466
What is this?

592
00:30:59,468 --> 00:31:02,035
My personal lockup --

593
00:31:02,037 --> 00:31:04,571
keepsakes, mementos,

594
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:08,942
things I'd prefer the rabble not
to get their grubby hands on.

595
00:31:08,944 --> 00:31:10,978
Is that you?

596
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,980
Oh, the good old days.

597
00:31:17,486 --> 00:31:20,387
Why are we here?

598
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:22,789
For this.

599
00:31:25,461 --> 00:31:27,294
The Rod of Aaron --

600
00:31:27,296 --> 00:31:28,929
created by God
on the sixth day

601
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:31,965
and given to Aaron,
brother of Moses.

602
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,267
I knew it was powerful,

603
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:36,136
but I had no idea
that it was a...

604
00:31:36,138 --> 00:31:37,638
A Hand of God.

605
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,640
Can I touch it?

606
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:41,975
With all due respect,
Simmons,

607
00:31:41,977 --> 00:31:44,945
I don't think
you can handle my rod.

608
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:47,014
I bet I can.

609
00:31:52,655 --> 00:31:54,922
Is it just me, or...

610
00:31:54,924 --> 00:31:57,758
Is it getting
a little phallic in here?

611
00:32:17,183 --> 00:32:18,516
Drop it.

612
00:32:31,131 --> 00:32:33,932
Isn't this a fun surprise?

613
00:32:38,605 --> 00:32:43,174
You really thought
you could double-cross me?

614
00:32:43,176 --> 00:32:45,009
Me?

615
00:32:47,847 --> 00:32:50,348
You know I invented
the double-cross?

616
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,984
Like, literally?

617
00:32:52,986 --> 00:32:57,221
Of course, I couldn't have
orchestrated all of this

618
00:32:57,223 --> 00:33:03,261
without the lovely, talented
Simmons here.

619
00:33:03,263 --> 00:33:07,999
She, um --
she hates you, B-T-Dubs.

620
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:10,401
Yeah.
I really do.

621
00:33:10,403 --> 00:33:12,603
Yeah, they all do.

622
00:33:12,605 --> 00:33:15,873
Like, every demon in Hell.

623
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,642
Can't really blame them,
can you?

624
00:33:17,644 --> 00:33:25,450
I mean, maybe once you were
the evilest evil that ever...

625
00:33:25,452 --> 00:33:28,686
Eviled --
present company excluded.

626
00:33:29,756 --> 00:33:31,889
But now...

627
00:33:31,891 --> 00:33:36,094
You're nothing but
Dean Winchester's number-one fan.

628
00:33:36,096 --> 00:33:38,963
Sam and Dean.

629
00:33:38,965 --> 00:33:43,434
I got to admit --
after all the stories,

630
00:33:43,436 --> 00:33:45,937
I thought you'd be...

631
00:33:45,939 --> 00:33:47,171
More.

632
00:33:47,173 --> 00:33:48,639
Well,
sorry to disappoint.

633
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:51,042
It's my fault.
You get your hopes up.

634
00:33:51,044 --> 00:33:55,580
You want an L.A. 10,
but you settle for a Kansas 5.

635
00:33:57,584 --> 00:33:59,517
Life, right?

636
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,651
The name's --

637
00:34:00,653 --> 00:34:02,286
We don't care.

638
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:05,289
Okay.
Small talk over.

639
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:07,425
Kill them.
W--

640
00:34:07,427 --> 00:34:09,460
Gunnar, Gunnar, no. Wait.

641
00:34:09,462 --> 00:34:10,695
Dean!

642
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:25,376
I knew
you were hiding something.

643
00:34:25,378 --> 00:34:30,114
I could see that last spark
of defiance in your eyes.

644
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:35,553
And rather than
beating it out of you, which --

645
00:34:35,555 --> 00:34:39,123
doable, but messy --

646
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:42,427
I let you lead me here.

647
00:34:51,738 --> 00:34:54,439
So I'm gonna take this...

648
00:34:57,177 --> 00:34:59,010
...and then
I'm gonna take you.

649
00:34:59,012 --> 00:35:02,847
And, oh, puppy,

650
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:05,950
you're not gonna like
what comes next.

651
00:35:28,374 --> 00:35:30,208
You looking for this?

652
00:35:38,184 --> 00:35:41,319
You really think
you could double-cross me?

653
00:35:41,321 --> 00:35:43,354
Me?!

654
00:35:43,356 --> 00:35:45,790
I <i>perfected</i>
the double-cross.

655
00:35:47,894 --> 00:35:50,628
Like, literally.

656
00:36:03,643 --> 00:36:05,309
Whew!

657
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:08,079
So, this is what it feels like
to be God.

658
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:09,380
Not bad.

659
00:36:09,382 --> 00:36:11,115
Tingly.

660
00:36:11,117 --> 00:36:17,288
So, if this can hurt something
as powerful as the Darkness,

661
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:20,825
I wonder...
What can it do to you?

662
00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:32,603
Sorry, kid.
I don't want to do this.

663
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:34,672
Oh, then don't.

664
00:36:34,674 --> 00:36:37,275
You say that
like I got a choice.

665
00:36:37,277 --> 00:36:38,309
That guy out there,
he's a --

666
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:41,445
He's a demon.
I know.

667
00:36:42,782 --> 00:36:47,485
And I know about Hell
and deals -- all of it.

668
00:36:47,487 --> 00:36:51,322
What's he got over you?

669
00:36:51,324 --> 00:36:53,558
You sold your soul,
didn't you?

670
00:36:59,165 --> 00:37:01,832
10 years ago,

671
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:04,368
I wanted another shot
at that belt.

672
00:37:05,538 --> 00:37:09,273
50,000 people
screaming my name.

673
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:15,012
I was desperate and dumb.

674
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:18,716
But you only had the title
for like a week.

675
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,786
Desperate and dumb.

676
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,890
Okay.

677
00:37:25,892 --> 00:37:27,258
Okay.

678
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,060
Look, you screwed up,
all right?

679
00:37:29,062 --> 00:37:31,996
Trust me.
I've been there.

680
00:37:31,998 --> 00:37:34,832
But it is never too late
to do the right thing.

681
00:37:39,138 --> 00:37:41,105
You really believe that?

682
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:44,609
I have to.

683
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,243
You made me bleed
my own blood.

684
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:25,383
You're out of juice,
huh?

685
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:34,191
Bollocks.

686
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:42,099
Does Crowley know
you're doing this?

687
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:43,934
Crowley's
Lucifer's bitch boy,

688
00:38:43,936 --> 00:38:46,003
which is <i>why</i>
I'm doing this.

689
00:38:46,005 --> 00:38:47,872
Stealing souls?

690
00:38:47,874 --> 00:38:49,407
Building a nest egg.

691
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:52,109
With the Darkness out
and the Devil running hell,

692
00:38:52,111 --> 00:38:56,647
well, it's kind of every demon
for him/her/shimself.

693
00:38:56,649 --> 00:38:58,783
So why do you need
Lawless?

694
00:38:58,785 --> 00:39:01,352
Well,
I can't be everywhere.

695
00:39:01,354 --> 00:39:05,122
When the g-man's deal came due,
I gave him a choice --

696
00:39:05,124 --> 00:39:08,993
end up hellhound chow
or collect souls for me.

697
00:39:08,995 --> 00:39:10,795
I'm delegating.

698
00:39:10,797 --> 00:39:12,830
That's what
good managers do.

699
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,800
Hey!

700
00:39:15,802 --> 00:39:17,935
Hey, yourself, handsome.

701
00:39:20,506 --> 00:39:22,907
Now, this --
this is my favorite part.

702
00:39:35,388 --> 00:39:37,588
Thanks.

703
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,990
Dean. Hey.

704
00:39:39,992 --> 00:39:41,959
Dean. Hey.
You all right?

705
00:39:41,961 --> 00:39:43,694
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good.

706
00:39:46,332 --> 00:39:48,032
What?

707
00:39:48,034 --> 00:39:49,533
Hellhounds.

708
00:39:49,535 --> 00:39:53,270
I always wondered
what they'd sound like.

709
00:39:58,244 --> 00:40:00,578
Listen, man.

710
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,247
You, uh...

711
00:40:03,249 --> 00:40:04,582
No.

712
00:40:06,052 --> 00:40:08,285
I've never been
a good man.

713
00:40:09,722 --> 00:40:11,856
I look in the mirror

714
00:40:11,858 --> 00:40:15,059
and I hate
the face looking back at me.

715
00:40:17,764 --> 00:40:20,331
No, I, uh...

716
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:21,999
I got this coming.

717
00:40:25,071 --> 00:40:26,670
Go on.

718
00:40:26,672 --> 00:40:28,672
Get out.

719
00:40:30,443 --> 00:40:31,776
Now.

720
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:52,852
Are you okay?

721
00:40:52,854 --> 00:40:55,588
Not even a little bit.

722
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,624
Lawless was a good guy.

723
00:40:57,626 --> 00:40:59,526
He didn't deserve to go out
like that, you know?

724
00:40:59,528 --> 00:41:02,162
Dean, you know what?
He made a bad decision.

725
00:41:02,164 --> 00:41:03,730
We've been there.

726
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,267
Yeah.

727
00:41:07,269 --> 00:41:09,736
Yeah, you, me, now Cass.

728
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,473
Dean, we'll get him back.

729
00:41:13,475 --> 00:41:15,241
We will.
We just got to --

730
00:41:15,243 --> 00:41:16,843
Keep grinding.

731
00:41:18,113 --> 00:41:20,547
No matter how much it hurts,
no matter how hard it gets,

732
00:41:20,549 --> 00:41:22,182
you got to keep grinding.

733
00:41:22,184 --> 00:41:23,950
?

734
00:41:23,952 --> 00:41:26,353
Right.

735
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,590
And that's how
we're gonna win.

736
00:41:30,592 --> 00:41:32,859
And we're gonna win.

737
00:41:32,861 --> 00:41:34,995
We're gonna save Cass,
we're gonna ice the Devil,

738
00:41:34,997 --> 00:41:37,998
and we're gonna
shank the Darkness.

739
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,901
And anyone
that gets in our way,

740
00:41:41,903 --> 00:41:43,703
well, God help them.

741
00:41:45,874 --> 00:41:47,374
Damn right.

742
00:41:49,878 --> 00:41:51,144
Damn right.
