1
00:00:03,082 --> 00:00:04,882
You both know
who we might need

2
00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:06,583
to help deal
with the Darkness.

3
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:09,787
Castiel: You're Metatron?
<i>The</i> Metatron?

4
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:13,157
I'm not an archangel,
I'm the scribe of God.

5
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:14,291
Chuck Shurley?

6
00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:15,692
Castiel:
He's a prophet of the Lord.

7
00:00:15,694 --> 00:00:17,861
I don't know
how prophets are chosen.

8
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:20,063
I don't want
to be a prophet.

9
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:21,431
No, you don't at all.

10
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:23,367
- Obviously, I'm a god.
- You're not a god.

11
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,068
God?!

12
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,570
I'm hoping
that you and I can finish

13
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:28,672
what I started
a few months ago.

14
00:00:28,674 --> 00:00:30,240
Metatron: You weren't alone
in the beginning.

15
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:31,909
Your sister
was with you.

16
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:34,845
Amara: I was the beginning,
and I will be the end.

17
00:00:34,847 --> 00:00:36,380
I will be all that there is.

18
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:38,048
We're bonded.

19
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,050
You're the one who set me free.
[Glass shatters]

20
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:42,419
Sam: Our priority is to set
Lucifer loose on Amara.

21
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:44,988
After we exorcise
Lucifer out of Cass

22
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,557
and put him
into a new vessel.

23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,792
Useless. Lucifer's hold
on him is too strong.

24
00:00:48,794 --> 00:00:53,197
Archangel plus God power
doesn't trump God's sister.

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,500
I think you and I need
to have a nice long chat.

26
00:00:56,502 --> 00:00:58,001
[Screams]

27
00:00:58,003 --> 00:01:00,370
If Amara wipes the slate,
everything is destroyed.

28
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:03,040
My partner and I
have seen this before, okay?

29
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:07,044
Wes, Deputy Harris were infected
by something in this fog.

30
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:09,646
The amulet ... it burns hot
in God's presence.

31
00:01:09,648 --> 00:01:11,915
Metatron: I mean, that's why
you're back, right?

32
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:14,084
This isn't her story.

33
00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:15,752
It's mine.

34
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:26,330
What the hell's
going on here, exactly?

35
00:01:26,332 --> 00:01:28,365
I'm happy to...
fill in the blanks,

36
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:30,267
but maybe
we should go somewhere

37
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:32,202
where we could actually
sit down.

38
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:33,971
We're not going anywhere
with you.

39
00:01:33,973 --> 00:01:36,440
Okay, how do we even know
that you're really Chuck

40
00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:41,378
and not just some crazy spell
or manifest...ation.

41
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,951
Kevin?

42
00:01:47,953 --> 00:01:50,287
Guys!

43
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:52,389
You're looking stressed.

44
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:55,759
Especially you.

45
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:58,262
I-It's cool.

46
00:01:58,264 --> 00:01:59,763
Trust Chuck.

47
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:02,332
Whatever it is
he needs you to do,

48
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:04,034
he must think
you can handle it.

49
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:09,239
I always trusted you.

50
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:12,142
Yeah, that ended well.

51
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,811
How did you ...

52
00:02:14,813 --> 00:02:17,281
Are you okay? Um...

53
00:02:17,283 --> 00:02:20,884
Yeah, I mean, you know,
given the circumstances.

54
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:22,552
Chuck: Yeah,
I don't mean to interrupt.

55
00:02:22,554 --> 00:02:24,221
Kind of a plateful here.

56
00:02:24,223 --> 00:02:25,989
And, Kevin...

57
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:28,058
you've been
in the Veil long enough.

58
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,627
It's time
you had an upgrade.

59
00:02:48,113 --> 00:02:49,780
Holy crap.

Okay.

63
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,558
So, wow, um, Chuck ...
[Chuckles]

64
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,527
Well, I guess we don't
call you that, huh?

65
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:04,995
I prefer it.

66
00:03:04,997 --> 00:03:07,531
Okay,
uh, “Chuck” it is.

67
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:09,967
[Sighs]

68
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:13,070
I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to, uh,

69
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:16,740
give Dean and me a moment
to start to process.

70
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:18,875
We didn't even know
you were around.

71
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:22,379
I mean, we knew about Chuck,
but we just didn't know about...

72
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:23,747
Chuck.

73
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:26,984
I mean, I-I-I was
hoping you were around.

74
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:29,086
I-I-I prayed and I ...
but I don't know if they

75
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:31,621
got, uh, lost in the spam or if ...
Sam?

76
00:03:31,623 --> 00:03:33,090
- Yeah?
- Babbling.

77
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:34,691
Okay.

78
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:39,196
I'm getting that not
everyone's totally on board.

79
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:51,208
Here's the thing,
um...Chuck...

80
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,778
And I mean
no disrespect.

81
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,513
Um...

82
00:03:56,515 --> 00:03:58,715
I'm guessing you came back
to help with the Darkness,

83
00:03:58,717 --> 00:04:00,450
and that's great.

84
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:03,687
That's, you know ...
It's fantastic.

85
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:07,758
Um, but you've
been gone a ... a...

86
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,460
long, long time.

87
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:12,629
And there's so much crap

88
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:15,432
that has gone down
on the Earth

89
00:04:15,434 --> 00:04:18,635
for thousands of years.

90
00:04:18,637 --> 00:04:24,207
I mean, plagues and wars,
slaughters.

91
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:27,177
And you were,
I don't know,

92
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:31,815
writing books,
going to fan conventions.

93
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:35,152
Were you even aware,
o-or did you just tune it out?

94
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:38,655
I was aware, Dean.

95
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:41,058
But you did nothing.

96
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,893
And, again, I-I'm not trying
to piss you off.

97
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:44,761
You know, I don't want to turn
into a pillar of salt.

98
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:46,563
I actually ...
I didn't do that.

99
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,766
Okay.

100
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,539
People ...
People pray to you.

101
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,508
People build churches
for you.

102
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,879
They fight wars in your name,
and you did nothing.

103
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,083
You're frustrated.

104
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,921
I get it.

105
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:13,490
Believe me,
I was hands-on ...

106
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:19,830
Real hands-on for,
wow, ages.

107
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:23,467
I was so sure
if I kept stepping in,

108
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:27,704
teaching, punishing,

109
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:31,942
that these beautiful creatures
that I created...

110
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:34,511
would grow up.

111
00:05:34,513 --> 00:05:37,714
But it only stayed the same.

112
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:41,918
And I saw that I needed
to step away

113
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,121
and let my baby find its way.

114
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:49,192
Being overinvolved
is no longer parenting.

115
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:51,461
[Sighs]

116
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:53,029
It's enabling.

117
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:57,300
But it didn't get
better.

118
00:05:57,302 --> 00:06:01,304
Well, I've been
mulling it over.

119
00:06:01,306 --> 00:06:05,242
And from where I sit,
I think it has.

120
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:12,249
Well, from where I sit,
it feels like you left us

121
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:14,951
and you're trying
to justify it.

122
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:20,123
I know you had
a complicated upbringing, Dean,

123
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,260
but don't confuse me
with your dad.

124
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,298
[Lucifer groans]

125
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,367
[Screams]

126
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:33,069
[Panting]

127
00:06:34,907 --> 00:06:37,574
[Screaming]

128
00:06:42,481 --> 00:06:44,981
Amara: End your suffering,
Lucifer.

129
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:48,718
Call out to him.
Beg him to save you.

130
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,923
[Laughs]

131
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:57,394
Want me to beg Daddy to come
rescue his screw-up of a son?

132
00:06:57,396 --> 00:06:59,062
[Chuckles]

133
00:06:59,064 --> 00:07:06,102
I'm no fan of Pops,
but he did make all of...

134
00:07:06,104 --> 00:07:08,572
you know, everything.

135
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:12,309
And that's something
that you could never do,

136
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:15,679
because all you
ever wanted was nothing.

137
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:18,582
It's not
too inspiring, is it?

138
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:21,718
because all you
You're strong, Amara.

139
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:25,055
You may defeat him.

140
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,527
But you will never be him.

141
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,097
You have to understand
this about the Darkness ...

142
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:35,599
she's relentless,

143
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:38,201
a force beyond
human comprehension.

144
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:40,370
It's the only reason
I came off the sidelines.

145
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:42,421
Must have been great
being her brother, huh?

146
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:43,541
It was the worst.

147
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:46,443
Always telling me what to do,
making me do what she wanted.

148
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:48,078
I mean, you guys
know how that works.

149
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:52,716
So, where is she?

150
00:07:52,718 --> 00:07:55,552
No freakin' idea, fellas.

151
00:07:55,554 --> 00:07:58,388
She's warded herself
specifically against me.

152
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:01,791
What have you
come up with?

153
00:08:01,793 --> 00:08:05,128
Zip, and we've been at it
for months.

154
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:09,165
Well...matter of time.

155
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:12,669
I've always had faith
in you...

156
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:16,673
...even if you didn't return
the favor.

157
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:18,308
Where's the guest room?

158
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,443
I could use a shower.

159
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:22,078
Uh, it's, um...

160
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,814
just down the hallway ...
the fourth door on the left.

161
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:26,983
[Clicks tongue]

162
00:08:26,985 --> 00:08:29,486
[Sighs]

163
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:31,688
Hey, Chuck.

164
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:36,359
You know that she's got
Lucifer, right?

165
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:38,094
Uh-huh.

166
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:44,367
The way we heard it,
um...

167
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:46,503
last time when you bottled up
the Darkness,

168
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:49,472
it ... it took more
than just you.

169
00:08:49,474 --> 00:08:52,876
I mean, we heard
that Lucifer was involved.

170
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:55,178
No.

171
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,613
No?

172
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:00,817
Lucifer was perhaps
my greatest hope

173
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:02,452
and my bitterest
disappointment.

174
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:04,254
Do you think if I could have
trusted him for a moment,

175
00:09:04,256 --> 00:09:05,689
I would have put him
in the Cage?

176
00:09:05,691 --> 00:09:07,023
And I wasn't gonna
mention this,

177
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:09,426
but thank you so much
for springing him.

178
00:09:09,428 --> 00:09:11,895
That wasn't
really the plan, um...

179
00:09:11,897 --> 00:09:15,865
Now, as bad as he was,
after all this time in prison,

180
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:17,734
he's probably worse.

181
00:09:17,736 --> 00:09:20,503
And by now, he could have formed
an alliance with Amara.

182
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:23,306
Not walking
into that trap, guys.

183
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:25,842
So, no.

184
00:09:29,514 --> 00:09:31,848
Thus spake the Lord.

185
00:09:36,855 --> 00:09:38,621
Amara:
Something's out there.

186
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:41,024
Lucifer: Hmm, always is.

187
00:09:41,026 --> 00:09:44,127
This is new.
Something's changed.

188
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:47,097
Maybe Dad picked up
on your latest slaughterfest.

189
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:49,165
Spoiled brat.

190
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,935
I needed solitude
and he needed a fan club,

191
00:09:51,937 --> 00:09:54,738
so he made all that.

192
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,640
Then when I complained,
he stuffed me

193
00:09:57,642 --> 00:10:00,577
in a hole for eons ...
with your help.

194
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:02,579
Stop whining.

195
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:05,749
I don't need this.

196
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:07,684
[Groans]

197
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:18,228
?

198
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:35,912
[Sighs]

199
00:10:38,483 --> 00:10:41,217
Come on, Amara.
Where are you?

200
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:45,688
Amara:
I've missed you, Dean.

201
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,691
It's been a while
since we've spoken.

202
00:10:48,693 --> 00:10:52,829
I'm aware
my brother has surfaced.

203
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:58,435
If you should cross paths,
if he should reach out to you,

204
00:10:58,437 --> 00:11:01,070
he should know this ...

205
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:06,176
Lucifer, his favorite,
isn't doing so well.

206
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:13,349
Say nothing of the vessel,
your friend Castiel.

207
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:15,618
By choosing to ignore me,

208
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,154
my brother is allowing
this to happen.

209
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:23,393
These and...
other things.

210
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:26,262
I thought
you should know.

211
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:35,171
[Insects chirping]

212
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:40,276

[Keyboard keys clacking]

217
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:25,574
Anything?

218
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:28,343
Nada.

219
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:30,512
Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah.

220
00:12:30,514 --> 00:12:33,482
You know, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

221
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:36,818
but, for once, I actually
wish Rowena was here.

222
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,020
I mean, maybe she could
track down Amara.

223
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:40,489
She's done it before.

224
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:42,357
Yeah, but you can bet she
and the Book are gonna

225
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,359
stay stashed until
this whole thing is over.

226
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:48,663
Where's Chuck?

227
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:52,567
Sleeping in, I guess.

228
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:54,636
Does God sleep?

229
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,707
I know he takes
really long showers.

230
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:01,776
Right, and sings, too ...
like, crappy old folk songs.

231
00:13:01,778 --> 00:13:04,446
I had to tell him
to cool it three times.

232
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:06,248
You told God to cool it?

233
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,250
Yeah, I sleep.

234
00:13:10,387 --> 00:13:14,589
You know, I know this
is a really strange situation and all,

235
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:18,160
but it's also
really amazing, you know?

236
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:19,895
I mean, it's God.
[Chuckles]

237
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:21,563
There's so many things
I want to ask him,

238
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:23,131
uh, like, uh,
t-the planets, you know?

239
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:24,699
Why are they round?
Or ears.

240
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:26,101
I always thought
they were strange.

241
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:27,936
Okay, fanboy, calm down.

242
00:13:27,938 --> 00:13:29,371
Let's stay focused.

243
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:31,373
We got to find Lucifer
before it's too late.

244
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,575
Too late?

245
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:40,348
Amara is ...
she's in my head.

246
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,551
Hey, I didn't ask for it, okay?
She just showed up.

247
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:44,886
But she's showing me visions
of ... of Lucifer.

248
00:13:44,888 --> 00:13:47,389
By Lucifer, I mean Cass,
and he looks like crap ...

249
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,890
like she's really doing
a number on him.

250
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:50,559
Shh.
Hey.

251
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:52,561
Morning.

252
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:54,696
Is that my robe?

253
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:58,133
I'm telling you guys,
it's a mistake

254
00:13:58,135 --> 00:13:59,901
to get mixed up
with Lucifer.

255
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:02,237
Much as it pained me,
I had to walk away.

256
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,472
Too much drama.

257
00:14:04,474 --> 00:14:05,774
Do you have any bacon?

258
00:14:05,776 --> 00:14:07,742
You eat bacon?

259
00:14:07,744 --> 00:14:08,910
Yeah.

260
00:14:08,912 --> 00:14:11,179
Hey, guys,
this just came up.

261
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:17,285
Looks like that fog, the, um...
Amara fog, uh, hit another town.

262
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:18,887
And?

263
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:22,057
And this one wasn't
as lucky as the last one.

264
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:25,560
Thousands died.
Uh, everybody died.

265
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:27,629
But, uh,
except for one man.

266
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:29,030
How'd you miss
that one?

267
00:14:29,032 --> 00:14:30,765
She's baiting me.

268
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:32,500
I can't respond every time.

269
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:33,868
I won't be manipulated.

270
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,370
Yeah, but thousands
of people are dead.

271
00:14:35,372 --> 00:14:36,805
Unfortunately.

272
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:38,540
So find her.

273
00:14:40,677 --> 00:14:43,311

<i>breaking news at this hour</i>

[Cellphone ringing]

282
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,192
What?

283
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:35,063
I notice you've been in touched
with Chuck.

284
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:37,632
Well, I've got some...

285
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:40,335
information
you're gonna need to know.

286
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:42,137
Okay, say it.

287
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:44,406
No.

288
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:47,509
It's got to be in person ...
something I got to show you.

289
00:15:52,582 --> 00:15:56,217
Professor Redfield.
FBI.

290
00:15:58,555 --> 00:16:00,789
- Call me Donatello.
- Yeah.

291
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,490
I'm named after him.

292

The, uh,
Renaissance sculptor.

294
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:11,366
Right, of course.

295
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:18,640
The cops think
I'm a terrorist.

296
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:20,775
I-I teach chemistry
at the university.

297
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:23,611
I-I lead a quiet life.
I have a cat!

298
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:25,413
Had a cat.

299
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:27,015
Well, we are, uh,
sorry for your loss.

300
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:29,150
Just a few questions.

301
00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:32,587
Um, other than the fog, did you
notice anything or anyone

302
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:35,957
that seemed out of place
on the street that night?

303
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:37,859
It ... It all happened
so fast.

304
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:39,127
I, uh...

305
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:40,995
It was like
it came out of nowhere.

306
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:43,031
We hardly ever get fog,
and never like that.

307
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,532
[Chuckles]

308
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:46,334
It was horrible.

309
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:48,069
They were clutching
their throats

310
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:50,138
like ... like ...
like they were choking.

311
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,775
And...oh.

312
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:57,579
Their bodies ...
Oh, my God ...

313
00:16:57,581 --> 00:17:02,317
these terrible black streaks.
[Gasping]

314
00:17:05,655 --> 00:17:07,622
And that's when
it happened.

315
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:11,218
It was like nothing I've ever felt
before in my life. [Screaming]

316
00:17:11,294 --> 00:17:13,795
It was like my head was
exploding, only not with pain ...

317
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:17,532
with ... with ... with knowledge
and ... and clarity!

318
00:17:17,534 --> 00:17:19,200
Things that I'd never
known before.

319
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:23,838
Symbols and ... and voices ...
in languages I don't speak!

320
00:17:27,544 --> 00:17:30,845
Then...

321
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:33,715
horrible...

322
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:37,419
horrible visions...

323
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:41,389
of destruction...

324
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:43,425
and death.

325
00:17:46,563 --> 00:17:48,863
You think I'm crazy.

326
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:51,199
No, uh, not at all.

327
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:54,536
Just, uh, you know,
will you give us a moment?

328
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:00,942
I mean, you get that this is all
sounding familiar, right?

329
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:03,545
Yeah. Yeah, like when Kevin
found out he was a prophet.

330
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:05,180
So, what,
this guy's a prophet?

331
00:18:05,182 --> 00:18:06,748
Yeah, but I thought
Crowley rounded up

332
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,216
all the future prophets
and tried to kill them.

333
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:09,751
Yeah,
but we rescued them

334
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:11,753
and Donatello
wasn't a part of that,

335
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:14,289
but, yeah, it's possible
Crowley missed a few.

336
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,258
And, obviously, he had no idea
he was next in line after Kevin.

337
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,561
How would he? He hadn't gotten
hit by the God power yet.

338
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:23,031
So, Amara's fog ...

339
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:24,999
could it have been
Amara's God power?

340
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:28,736
It's still God power.

341
00:18:28,738 --> 00:18:31,139
All right,
I need a coffee.

342
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:32,674
Yeah.

343
00:18:36,313 --> 00:18:39,747
Um...
am ... am I under arrest?

344
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:42,617
No, just, um...

345
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:45,987
want to check out a few more
aspects of your story.

346
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:47,956
Here we go.
Would you look at this?

347
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,692
Try and read it
a little.

348
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:53,895
Oh, I can't.

349
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:56,030
I ... I don't know
anything about it.

350
00:18:56,032 --> 00:18:59,100
“Behold the face of God”"

351
00:18:59,102 --> 00:19:00,768
That came right to me.

352
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,705
Who speaks this language?
- Angels.

353
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:08,543
Amara:
I need to see you, Dean.

354
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:12,480
Events are moving swiftly
and everything will change.

355
00:19:12,482 --> 00:19:17,819
I need to meet with you,
but not like this.

356
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:19,721
Somewhere alone.

357
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,354
Donatello: I can't be a prophet.
I'm an atheist and a chemist!

358
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:39,258
I-I believe in molecules,
not God.

359
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,893
All right, well, we're pretty
sure that prophets

360
00:19:40,895 --> 00:19:42,495
don't even know
they're in the game

361
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:44,030
until they've actually been
touched by God, so...

362
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:45,798
I-I was touched by God?

363
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,500
Or possibly
his sister, Amara.

364
00:19:47,502 --> 00:19:49,302
- He has family?
- Yeah.

365
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:51,504
She wants him gone so she can
annihilate the universe.

366
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:52,939
That's the headline.
- What?

367
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,374
And since you might have
a hotline to her,

368
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:55,908
we're hoping you can
help us find her.

369
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,543
W-Why would you want
to find her?

370
00:19:57,545 --> 00:19:59,112
We got to rescue this guy
she's holding.

371
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,947
- Who is?
- Lucifer, her nephew.

372
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,594
Who's possessing an angel
at the moment.

373
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,350
Yeah.

374
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:05,718
Oh.
[Door handle rattles]

375
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,687
It's locked.

376
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:08,955
Yeah, that, too.

377
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,857
Sometimes we keep monsters
in the back.

378
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:12,525
I ... I ... I can't do this!

379
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:14,427
- Yeah, you can.
- No, I promise you I can't.

380
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:16,896
Look, we can't force you to do
this. You've got to want this.

381
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:20,266
It ... It's like asking me
to believe in Santa Claus.

382
00:20:20,268 --> 00:20:22,168
- Oh, well, actually ...
- Dean, not now.

383
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,137
Okay, look, we ... we're not
asking you to believe

384
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,038
that this is true,
just act like you do.

385
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,241
People do it
all the time.

386
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:30,109
[Shudders]

387
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:31,677
What?

388
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,146
I ... I-I don't know.

389
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,882
I ... I think
I'm sensing something.

390
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:37,350
Something big.

391
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:38,918
Like Amara?

392
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,253
I don't think so.

393
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:42,255
Although, how would I know?

394
00:20:42,257 --> 00:20:44,724
[Sighs]

395
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:47,293
Could it be...

396
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:49,095
Him?

397
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:51,864
[Door opens]

398
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:55,334
[Door closes]

399
00:20:55,336 --> 00:21:00,940
?

400
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:02,408
Hey, Chuck.

401
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,178
We, uh, found someone.

402
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,580
I think
he's the next prophet.

403
00:21:08,616 --> 00:21:10,249
Neat-o.

404
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:15,555
Is that my computer?

405
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:17,490
I've never seen
so much porn.

406
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,561
Not in one sitting.

407
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:25,398
It's ... I'm gonna...

408
00:21:28,002 --> 00:21:30,169
So, uh, listen.

409
00:21:30,171 --> 00:21:31,771
He ... He's ...
He's a little nutted out

410
00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:33,272
about the whole booga-booga
of it all,

411
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:36,309
so maybe just dial back
the ... the God stuff.

412
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:37,610
[Clicks tongue]

413
00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:38,744
[Door opens]

414
00:21:38,746 --> 00:21:40,246
No pants on.

415
00:21:40,248 --> 00:21:41,781
Sam?
- Yeah?

416
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:43,182
Yeah.

417
00:21:49,123 --> 00:21:51,190
All right, you're safe.
Come on.

418
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:54,627
[Sighs]

419
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:57,497
Donatello,
good to see ya.

420
00:21:57,499 --> 00:21:59,866
Sorry about your cat.

421
00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:01,968
You ... You know me?

422
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,769
I made you.

423
00:22:03,771 --> 00:22:06,939
I made all of you, even the ones
who aren't born yet.

424
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:10,543
Oh, my God.

425
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:12,778
It's you.

426
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,247
G-Good to meet you, Sir!

427
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,315
Your ... Your celestial
magnificence, your ...

428
00:22:16,317 --> 00:22:17,884
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

429
00:22:17,886 --> 00:22:20,286
He ... He just kind of
goes by Chuck.

430
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:23,122
So, we good?
Y'all signed up?

431
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:28,828
Uh...I-I-I guess you know
that I was an atheist,

432
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,397
until 10 minutes ago.

433
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:33,432
Is that an issue?

434
00:22:33,434 --> 00:22:35,801
Not for me.
I mean, I believe in me.

435
00:22:35,803 --> 00:22:38,504
But your skepticism is
to be expected.

436
00:22:38,506 --> 00:22:40,973
I did include free will
in the kit. [Chuckles]

437
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,479
[Clicks tongue]
Welcome aboard.

438
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:49,549
? Don't let the rain come down ?

439
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:53,252
? Oh, no, don't let the rain
come down ?

440
00:22:53,254 --> 00:22:55,755
? O? no, don't let the rain
come down ?

441
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:59,091
Oh, uh, barkeep,
dos margaritas!

442
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:02,595
Top-shelf tequila please
for my amigos.

443
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:05,031
Their treat.

444
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:06,699
All right.

445
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:08,668
We're here.
Don't try to pull any crap.

446
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:13,773
And what variety of crap
could I possibly pull?

447
00:23:13,775 --> 00:23:16,142
I've lost my grace.

448
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,777
Look at me.
I got nothing.

449
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:19,512
Okay, why did you
have to see us?

450
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:21,981
What's so urgent?
- [Sighs]

451
00:23:23,851 --> 00:23:29,522
So, I, uh, notice you've been
in touch with Chuck.

452
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:30,890
A.K.A., you know who.

453
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:32,658
Yeah, yeah.
Is this going anywhere?

454
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,760
Yes, Chuck agreed
to take on Amara.

455
00:23:34,762 --> 00:23:36,829
He said that?

456
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:39,098
Used those words?
- Pretty much.

457
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,499
Huh.

458
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:42,969
So, what ...
he's not confronting Amara?

459
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:44,570
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

460
00:23:44,572 --> 00:23:48,407
He's ... He's going to ...
He's gonna...meet with her.

461
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:51,310
He's just not gonna
take her down.

462
00:23:54,048 --> 00:23:56,749
He's gonna...

463
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:58,484
sacrifice himself.

464
00:23:58,486 --> 00:24:01,587
Let her do whatever
she wants with him.

465
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:04,256
Do you really expect us
to buy this?

466
00:24:04,258 --> 00:24:06,659
No.

467
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:09,562
Of course not.

468
00:24:09,564 --> 00:24:12,131
Here.

469
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:13,633
Buy this.

470
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:16,435
[Thuds]

471
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:19,939
Ignore the typos,
but read it.

472
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:22,341
It's in his own words.

473
00:24:22,343 --> 00:24:25,177
It's not an autobiography.

474
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:27,713
It's a suicide note.

475
00:24:43,347 --> 00:24:44,713
[Child laughing]

476
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:46,248
You wanted to talk.

477
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:50,853
This seemed
as good a place as any.

478
00:24:52,656 --> 00:24:55,657
Look at them ...
endlessly optimistic.

479
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:59,128
The wind blows over his tower,
he rebuilds.

480
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,064
Always gets me.

481
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:05,968
If that's so,
why are you bailing?

482
00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:14,409
When you see Amara,
you're throwing in the towel?

483
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:19,081
[Sighs]
Metatron.

484
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,049
Loose lips.

485
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:23,185
But you think I'm a dick.
Why do you care?

486
00:25:28,058 --> 00:25:31,560
Because before
you went M.I.A...

487
00:25:31,562 --> 00:25:33,295
you did a lot.

488
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:37,232
Thank you.

489
00:25:37,234 --> 00:25:39,668
And what you call
throwing in the towel,

490
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,103
I call strategy.

491
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:45,641
How is death by your sister
a strategy?

492
00:25:45,643 --> 00:25:47,442
I know her.

493
00:25:47,444 --> 00:25:49,711
Her beef is with me.

494
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:54,082
Yeah, but I still don't
understand how ... how dying

495
00:25:54,084 --> 00:25:57,119
is a ...
a blueprint for success.

496
00:25:57,121 --> 00:25:58,887
I don't be dying.

497
00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:00,856
I'll be caged.

498
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:05,160
I trade myself for...
everything I created.

499
00:26:05,162 --> 00:26:06,662
<i>It</i> goes on.

500
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:17,172
Okay, well, the, um,
Amara that I know is...

501
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:19,942
a mountain of ...
of pissed off.

502
00:26:19,944 --> 00:26:22,211
I mean, she spent a ...
a gazillion years in solitary.

503
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,413
The only thing she's thinking
is ... is it's her turn.

504
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:28,116
And I'll give it to her,
as long as she accepts the deal.

505
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:30,719
The deal?
What...

506
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:32,387
She's gonna eliminate you,

507
00:26:32,389 --> 00:26:34,289
and then she's gonna destroy
everything that you've created.

508
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:35,991
She's told me this
personally.

509
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:39,294
[Sighs]

510
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:42,064
You started this.

511
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:44,132
You started all of this,

512
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:46,869
but does that give you
the right to end it?

513
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:50,806
You know, we're not just
some toys you throw away.

514
00:26:50,808 --> 00:26:54,576
I think you owe us
more than that.

515
00:26:54,578 --> 00:26:57,646
If my plan doesn't work,

516
00:26:57,648 --> 00:26:59,882
then humans will step up.

517
00:27:01,852 --> 00:27:04,186
You, Sam,

518
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:09,725
others that are the chosen
will have to find a way.

519
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:12,594
It's why
I saved you years ago.

520
00:27:15,866 --> 00:27:21,570
You're the firewall
between light and darkness.

521
00:27:21,572 --> 00:27:23,639
No.

522
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,507
No, I...

523
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:28,176
Look, give me a ...
a vampire, and I'm good.

524
00:27:28,178 --> 00:27:31,046
But this ...
God's sister?

525
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:33,615
That is way above
my pay grade.

526
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:35,117
I...

527
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:37,252
It...

528

Bottom line is i-it's you
who has to take her out.

529
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:44,159
And look,
and then after that,

530
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:45,761
you know,
get a condo in Cancun.

531
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:47,429

00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:58,974
I do now.

535
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:04,446
Well...

if Chuck is leaning our way.

You don't know?

539
00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:17,559
If we do get Lucifer
for the added muscle,

540
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:20,896
then...maybe he'll
play ball.

541
00:28:20,898 --> 00:28:22,531

they hated each other.

542
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:24,733
Yeah, they do.

Wow.

544
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,503
I so miss
being an atheist.

Make it quick.

00:28:36,313 --> 00:28:37,813
Thanks for inviting me.

550

Inviting you?

You've been circling
the building all night.

552
00:28:41,118 --> 00:28:43,285
You sent me 200 text messages
with dumbass emojis.

553
00:28:43,287 --> 00:28:44,619
You got three minutes.

554
00:28:44,621 --> 00:28:47,456
Oh.

Metatron, scribe of God.

557
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:56,932
I was there
when you were designed.

558
00:28:56,934 --> 00:29:01,336
I wrote your name on the inside
of the angels' eyelids.

559
00:29:01,338 --> 00:29:03,171
He's freaking me out.

560
00:29:03,173 --> 00:29:05,440
Okay.
You said you wanted to help.

561
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:08,377
Besides world-class douchery,
what do you have to offer?

562

Oh, nothing.

563
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:13,682
I just transcribed the angel
tablet and know all the spells.

564
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:16,685
And I know
what makes Amara tick.

565
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:19,721
And I had a relationship
with the big guy for eons.

566
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:21,123
Shall I keep going?

567
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,025
Ah!
That's mine!

568
00:29:25,562 --> 00:29:28,530
As much as I hate
to admit this...

569
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:29,998
he kind of has a point.

570
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,067
- I don't know.

571

You need all the help you
can get ... even douche help.

572
00:29:35,706 --> 00:29:38,640
And since when did you jump
on the God wagon?

573
00:29:38,642 --> 00:29:40,175
You never
used to give a damn.

574
00:29:40,177 --> 00:29:43,445
Well, I didn't ...
at one time.

575
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:47,582
Now that he's gone all kamikaze,
leaving us with the Darkness,

576
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:50,585

578
00:29:52,022 --> 00:29:55,924
I was by his side
since the creation.

579
00:29:55,926 --> 00:29:58,093
He believed in me.

580
00:29:58,095 --> 00:30:01,663
If there's something I can do
to help save him

581
00:30:01,665 --> 00:30:04,132
and his creation,
then...

582
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,904
...uh, it seems like
I should.

583
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:13,842
?

584
00:30:13,844 --> 00:30:16,912
The plan is to rescue
Lucifer from Amara.

585
00:30:16,914 --> 00:30:20,248
Then he teleports us out
of Amara's hideout

586
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,619
and we convince Chuck
to use him to fight her.

That's your plan?

Do you even know
where Amara is?

590
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,565
Um, I think I might know
where she is.

591
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,200
I've been getting this vibe.

592
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:41,870
Uh, it's like a ping
in my cerebral cortex.

593
00:30:41,872 --> 00:30:45,173
Oh, so either Amara
or a stroke.

594
00:30:45,175 --> 00:30:48,944
And how are we supposed to keep
Amara busy while we're...

595
00:30:48,946 --> 00:30:50,645
liberating Lucifer?

596
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:56,852

out to me, Dean.

You said you wanted
to meet.

600
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:33,021
And the...
sensations you arouse.

I know you feel
the same way.

602
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:39,094
So...what do we do?

603
00:31:40,864 --> 00:31:42,597
There can be no us.

604
00:31:46,336 --> 00:31:48,370
We should just
walk away.

605
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:52,374

out of here.

if you lunatics

to be grabbed by Amara.

for you.

my offer?

goodbye to it just yet.

you will.

00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:07,942
[Sighs]

708
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,147
Occasionally,
I do answer a prayer.

709
00:39:17,487 --> 00:39:19,654
[Bottle opens]

710
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:24,659
[Sighs]

711
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:26,861
You've changed.

712
00:39:30,934 --> 00:39:33,067
You've changed.

713
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:35,003
Well, still...

714
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:38,272
I'm really pretty much
the same.

715
00:40:01,096 --> 00:40:02,440
Still twitchy, huh?

716
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,713
Now, you've met God, Lucifer
and the Darkness.

717
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,830
- You gonna need a spa day.
- [Chuckles]

718
00:40:08,127 --> 00:40:09,461
Better a pair of hookers.

719
00:40:12,054 --> 00:40:13,976
I-I've to sort it all out

720
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:16,117
to see what comes next.

721
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:19,327
I don't feel much like
returning to academia and...

722
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,718
I sure as hell can't go back
to being an atheist.

723
00:40:21,742 --> 00:40:23,452
Yeah, I hear you. [Sniffles]

724
00:40:23,476 --> 00:40:25,476
- [Car approaching]
- Thank you...

725
00:40:25,952 --> 00:40:27,137
I guess.

726
00:40:28,315 --> 00:40:29,782
And, uh...

727
00:40:30,501 --> 00:40:32,024
if there is a tomorrow...

728
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:33,972
Giving your line of work,

729
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:36,058
I'll probably see you again.

730
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,120
Stay tuned, we may need you.

731
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:43,612
??

732
00:40:43,746 --> 00:40:45,598
[Sighs]

733
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:47,863
So Metatron took one for the team.

734
00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:50,089
- Yeah.
- Well, I wouldn't have call that.

735
00:40:51,455 --> 00:40:53,039
[Sighs]

736
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:54,540
So you won't tell me about it?

737
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,600
I mean Amara obviously figured out
something was going on and...

738
00:40:58,625 --> 00:40:59,907
she gonna rip your head off.

739
00:41:01,157 --> 00:41:02,907
She wants me to be a part of her.

740
00:41:03,673 --> 00:41:05,673
Not metaphorically,
I'm talking litterally.

741
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,922
Forever.

742
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,672
So in other words,

743
00:41:13,396 --> 00:41:14,544
<i>adios.</i>

744
00:41:14,568 --> 00:41:15,974
[Scoffs]

745
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:25,685
??
