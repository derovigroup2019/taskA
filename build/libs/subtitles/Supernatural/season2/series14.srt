1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,310
dad wants us to pick upwhere he left off

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,700
saving people,hunting things,the family business.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,480
"THEN"

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,670
My dad had a partneron his last hunt.

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,250
The guy screwed up,got my dad killed.

6
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,320
- What does this have to do  -it was your father,dean.

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,970
Maybe that's whatthe demon's doing -- pushing us,finding ways to break us.

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,730
I'm meg.

9
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,040
She's possessed --a human possessed by a demon.

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,550
Key of solomon --you get a demon in one,they're trapped,powerless.

11
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,200
Before dad died,he told something -- something about you.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,360
He said that I hadto save you,and if I couldn't,I'd have to kill you.

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,860
Did he know the demon's plansfor me?

14
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,580
Am I supposed to go dark side?

15
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,440
I never said that.

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,190
You're not careful,you will have to waste me one day,dean.

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,480
"NOW"

18
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,880
Ellen,it's me again.

19
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,470
Any chance you've heardfrom him?

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,090
I swear,it's like lookingfor my dad all over again.

21
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,700
I'm losing my mind here.

22
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,190
I've called hima thousand times.

23
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,240
It's nothing but voice mail.

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,990
I don't know where he wentor why.

25
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,640
Sam's just gone.

26
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,780
Hang on.

27
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,440
Sammy,where the hell are you?

28
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,380
Are you okay?

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,210
Hey,hey,hey,hey.

30
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,890
Calm down.

31
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:09,610
Where are you?

32
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,210
Don't move.

33
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,380
I'm on my way.

34
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,930
Sam,it's me.

35
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,680
Sam!

36
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,030
Sam?

37
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,560
Hey.

38
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,030
Hey,dean.

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,530
Are you bleeding?

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,670
I tried to wash it off.

41
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,990
Oh,my god.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,270
I don't thinkit's my blood.

43
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,050
Whose is it?

44
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,100
I don't know.

45
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,620
Sam,what the hell happened?

46
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,480
Dean...

47
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,350
I don't rememberanything.

51
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,610
What did you find out?

52
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,630
You checked in two days ago under the name richard sambora.

53
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,320
I think the scariest part about this whole thing is the fact that you're a bon jovi fan.

54
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,220
Dean.

55
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,550
Your room's been quiet.

56
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,080
Nobody's noticed anything unusual.

57
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,080
You mean no one saw me walking around covered in blood?

58
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,100
Yeah,that's what I mean.

59
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,830
Then how the hell did I get here?

60
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,600
What happened to me?

61
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,280
I don't know,but you're okay,and that's what matters.

62
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,050
Everything else,we can deal with.

63
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:57,960
Oh,really?

64
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,440
'Cause what if I hurt someone or worse?

65
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,610
Sam.

66
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,530
What if this is what dad warned you about?

67
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,490
Come on,man.

68
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,500
Let's not jump the gun here.

69
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,850
We don't know what happened.

70
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,910
We got to treat this like any other job.

71
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,400
What's the last thing you remember?

72
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,040
Me and you in that motel room in west texas.

73
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,390
We went out to grab some burgers.

74
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,700
West texas -- that was over a week ago.

75
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,270
That's it.

76
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,430
Next thing I knew,I was sitting here...

77
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,890
bloody.

78
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,340
I felt like I had been asleep for a month.

79
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,140
Okay,retrace your steps.

80
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,110
Manager said you left yesterday afternoon and never saw you come back.

81
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,240
Hey.

82
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,620
Recognize anything?

83
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,440
Not really.

84
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,400
Wait.

85
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,770
What?

86
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,960
I think I was here.

87
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,070
You remember?

88
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,590
Not really.It just...

89
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,200
feels familiar,you know?

90
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,900
Try that one.

91
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,760
Yeah.

92
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,130
Okay.

93
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,110
Wait.

94
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,530
Please tell meyou didn't steal this.

95
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,610
More blood.

96
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,370
Sam,backseat.

97
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,700
You think I used thison someone?

98
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,590
I'm not thinking anything.

99
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,500
Okay,now,this is disturbing.

100
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,270
Come on,man.

101
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,480
This couldn't have been you.

102
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,360
It could have beensomeone else -- somebody who,uh,smokes menthols.

103
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,510
Hey,a gas receipt,a few towns over.

104
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,100
All right,receipt's for10 gallons at pump number 2.

105
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,470
You getting any goose bumps yet?

106
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,790
"God,this looks familiar,"d?j?vu vibes?

107
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,790
Maybe someone insidewill remember you.

108
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,670
Come on.

109
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,210
You -- out of here.

110
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:16,760
Now.

111
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,740
I'm calling the cops.

112
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,650
You talking to him?

113
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,900
Yeah,I'm talking to him.

114
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,240
Jerk comes in yesterday,stinking drunk,grabs a 40 from the fridge,starts chugging it.

115
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,930
This guy?

116
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,330
You're drinking malt liquor?

117
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,080
Not after he whipped the bottleat my friggin' head.

118
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,240
This guy?

119
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,970
What,am I speaking urdu?

120
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,270
- I'm really sorryif I did anything  - tell your story walking,pal,okay?

121
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,260
Popo will be here in five.

122
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,820
Wait.

123
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,780
He's leaving.

124
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,740
Put the phone down.

125
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,090
Sam,go wait in the car.

126
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,660
- But,dean  - go wait in the car!

127
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,670
Okay,look,I just want to talkto you,that's it,okay?

128
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,550
When he took off yesterday,which way did he go?

129
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,710
Why don't you ask him?

130
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,060
'Cause I'm asking you.

131
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,660
Please,you'd be doing mea huge favor,okay?

132
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,310
Oh,do you a favor.

133
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,310
Well,that is what I live for.

134
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,690
You know,your buddy didn't payfor the booze or the smokes,which he also illegally lit up.

135
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,840
You saw him smoking?

136
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,440
Yeah,guy's a chimney.

137
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,530
This,uh...

138
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,820
ought to cover it.

139
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,830
Hmm,it's,uh,it's coming back to me now.

140
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,780
He took two packs.

141
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,750
Of course he did.

142
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,790
Heent north on route 71,straight out of town.

143
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,280
What's going on with you,sam,hmm?

144
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,460
The smoking,throwing bottles at people -- that sounds more like methan you.

145
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,210
Dean,wait.

146
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,360
Wait.Here.

147
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,370
Turn down that road.

148
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:00,850
What?

149
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,450
I don't know how I know.

150
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,390
I just do.

151
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,000
Whoever lives here,I'd saythey don't like surprises.

152
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,890
Should we knock?

153
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,990
Yeah,I guess.

154
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,440
Hey,dean.

155
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,430
I'm surprised the copsdidn't show -- place like this you'd thinkwould have an alarm.

156
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,050
Yeah,you would.

157
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,170
Hit the lights.

158
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,040
Dean,I did this.

159
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,810
We don't know that.

160
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,860
What else do you need?

161
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,820
How else do you explain the car,the knife,the blood?

162
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,320
I don't know,man.

163
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,540
Why don't you tell me?

164
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,570
Even if you did do this,I'm sure you had a reason -- you know,self-defense,he was a bad son of a bitch --something.

165
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,260
He doesn't have any I.D.

166
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,780
I need your lock pick.

167
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,430
What?

168
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,680
I need your lock pick.

169
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,000
Either this guy'sa unabomber -- or a hunter.

170
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,370
Dean,I thinkI killed a hunter.

171
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,790
Let's find out.

172
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,810
Here we go.

173
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,750
How do you erase this,huh?

174
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,920
Sam,come on.

175
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,110
I need your help.

176
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,590
I killed him,dean.

177
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,540
I just broke inand killed him.

178
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,930
Listen to me.

179
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,380
Whoever this guy is,he's a hunter,which means other huntersare gonna look for his killer,

180
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,590
which means we got to coverour tracks,okay?

181
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,530
His name was steve wandell.

182
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,930
This is a letterfrom his daughter.

183
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,620
Wipe your prints.Then we go.

184
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,190
All right,we get a couple hours' sleep,and then we put this place in our rearview mirror.

185
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,720
I know this is bad,okay?

186
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,730
You got to snap out of it.

187
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,590
Sam,say something.

188
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,570
Just get some sleepand leave in the morning?

189
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,410
Murder,dean --that's what I did.

190
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,760
Maybe,okay?

191
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,470
Hey,we don't --shapeshifter.

192
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,580
Oh,come on.

193
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,240
You know it wasn'T.

194
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,930
You saw the tape.

195
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,480
There was no eye flare,no distortion.

196
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,560
But it wasn't you,all right?

197
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,240
Yeah,it might have been you,but it wasn't you.

198
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,090
Well,I think it was.

199
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,300
I think maybemore than you know.

200
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,890
What the helldoes that mean?

201
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,090
For the last few weeks,I've been having...

202
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,450
I've been havingthese feelings.

203
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,310
What feelings?

204
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,360
Rage...

205
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,730
hate.

206
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,100
And I can't stop it.

207
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,940
It just gets worse.

208
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,650
Day by day,it gets worse.

209
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,260
You never told me this.

210
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,650
I didn't want to scare you.

211
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,330
Well,bang-up job on that.

212
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,610
Dean,the yellow-eyed demon -- you know he has plansfor me.

213
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,620
And we both know thathe's turned other children into killers before,too.

214
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,380
No one can control youbut you.

215
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,340
It sure doesn't seemlike that,dean.

216
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,850
It feels likeno matter what I do,slowly but surely,I'm just becoming --what?

217
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,730
Who I'm meant to be.

218
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,020
You said it onceyourself,dean.

219
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,220
I got to face upto who I am.

220
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,100
I didn't mean this!

221
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,450
But it's still true.

222
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,670
You know that.

223
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,730
Dad knew that,too.

224
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,970
That's why he told youif it ever came to this

225
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,920
shut up,sam.

226
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,720
Dean,you promised him.

227
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,690
You promised me.

228
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,350
No.

229
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,400
Listen to me.

230
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,920
We're gonna figurethis out,okay?

231
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,120
I mean,there's got to bea way,right?

232
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,530
Yeah,there is.

233
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,050
I don't want to hurtanyone else.

234
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,580
I don't want to hurt you.

235
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,230
You won'T.

236
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,570
Whatever this is,you can fight it.

237
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,750
No,I can'T...

238
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,710
not forever.

239
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,780
Here.You got to do it.

240
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,380
You know,I've tried so hardto keep you safe.

241
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,940
I know.

242
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,710
I can'T.

243
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,260
I'd rather die.

244
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,940
No.

245
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,330
You'll live.

246
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,090
You'll live to regret this.

247
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,960
It's past your checkout.

248
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,220
What?

249
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,320
It's past checkout,and I have a couple herethat need your room.

250
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,940
Yeah,I'll bet they do.

251
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,430
What time is it?

252
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,600
12:30.

253
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,340
The guy that was with me --have you seen him?

254
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:37,030
Yeah,he left before dawnin your car,and you should havegone with him because now I'm gonna haveto charge you extra.

255
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,270
Oh,son of a bitch.

256
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,660
It's just policy,sir.

257
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,280
I need to use your computer.

258
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,960
Why would I let youuse my computer?

259
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,160
Hi.

260
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,570

00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,030
What?

263
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:00,770
Yeah.

264
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,810
Justin is quite the triple threat.

265
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,790
Uh,anyway,he's not back yet,and I'm starting to worry.

266
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,520
Right,yeah,boys will be boys.

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,790

00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,680
Duluth,minnesota.

00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,800
Yeah,that is a long way to gofor a concert.

275
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,900
I appreciate your help.

276
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:42,870
Night.

277
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,940
Thank you.

278
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
Sorry,we're closing up.

279
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,450
How about just onefor the road?

280
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,220
Well,you're about the lastperson I'd expect to see.

281
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,760
Well...

282
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,990
I guess I'm fullof surprises.

283
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,950
So,can I get a beer?

284
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,930
Sure.

285
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,630
One beer.

286
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,330
So,how'd you find me?

287
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,750
Well,uh,it's kind ofwhat we do,you know?

288
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,620
Speaking of "we,"where's dean?

289
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,910
Couldn't make it.

290
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,980
So,what are youdoing here,sam?

291
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,050
We didn't exactly parton the best of terms.

292
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,620
Right.

293
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,690
that's why I'm here.

294
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,560
I kind of wanted to see if we could square things,you know?

295
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,680
That looks like it hurts.

296
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,540
No.

297
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,940
No,just...

298
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,580
had a run-inwith a hot stove.

299
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,650
So,you were saying somethingabout squaring things?

300
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,670
Yeah.

301
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,010
look,I know how you feelabout my dad,and I can't sayI blame you.

302
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:22,840
He was obsessed,consumed with hunting,and he didn't care who gotcaught in the crossfire.

303
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,040
And I guess that includedyour dad.

304
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,440
But that was my father.

305
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,720
That's not me.

306
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,990
What about dean?

307
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,950
Well,dean's more likemy father than I am,but he...

308
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,360
Boy...

309
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,670
you're really carrying a torchfor him,aren't you?

310
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,820
I'll take that as a yes.

311
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,140
It's too bad.

312
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,170
'Cause,see,dean,he likes you,sure,but...

313
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,650
not in the way you'd want.

314
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:11,640
I mean,maybe as kind ofa little sister,but romance -- that's justout of the question.

315
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,800
HeKind of thinksyou're a schoolgirl,you know?

316
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,940
I'm not tryingto hurt you,jo.

317
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,600
I -- I'm telling you'cause I care.

318
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,290
That's real kindof you,sam.

319
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,370
I mean it.

320
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,830
I care about you a lot.

321
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,100
Sam,what's going on?

322
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,190
I can be more to you,jo.

323
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,940
Maybe you should leave.

324
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,550
Okay.

325
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,980
Sam,get off me!

326
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,740
Sam,get off me!

327
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,800
Let go.

328
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,750
Jo,jo,jo.

329
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,940
Sam,no,please!

330
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,760
Please.

331
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,340
It didn't have to bethis way.

332
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,450
Maybe it did.

333
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:53,260
*before you slip into unconsciousness*

334
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,890
what the hell's going on?

335
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,940
What are you doing?

336
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,260
So,what exactlydid your mom tell you about how your dad died?

337
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,080
You're not sam.

338
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,390
Don't be so sure about that.

339
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,420
Answer the question....

340
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,860
come on.

341
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,400
It's me.

342
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:18,940
You can tell me anything.

343
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,060
You know that.

344
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,450
Answer the question.

345
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,240
fine.

346
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,370
Fine.

347
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,740
Our dadswere in california -- devil's gate reservoir.

348
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,140
They were setting a trapfor some kind of hell spawn.

349
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,630
John was hiding,waiting,and my dad was bait.

350
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,950
That's just like john.

351
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,270
Oh,I bet he dangled billlike meat on a hook.

352
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,060
Then what?

353
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,050
The thing showed up.

354
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,880
John got too eager,jumped out too soon,got my dad exposedout in the open.

355
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,110
The thing turned around...

356
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,310
and killed him.

357
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,690
Not quite.

358
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,600
What?

359
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,610
What?

360
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,820
See,it hurt him.

361
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,250
It didn't kill him.

362
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,690
You really don't knowthe truth,do you?

363
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,120
I bet your momdoesn't,either.

364
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,350
Know what?

365
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,700
You see,bill...

366
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,480
was all clawed up.

367
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,950
He was holding his insidesin his hands.

368
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,530
He was gargling and...

369
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,030
praying to see you and ellenone more time.

370
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,890
So my dad...

371
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,510
killed him.

372
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,730
He put him out of his miserylike a sick dog.

373
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,330
You're lying.

374
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:50,770
I'm not.

375
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,760
It's true.

376
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,570
My daddy shot your daddyin the head

377
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,900
how could you know that?

378
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,870
I hear things.

379
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,480
Why are you doing thisto me?

380
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,710
Like daddy,like daughter.

381
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,450
You're bait.

382
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,280
Open up.

383
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,970
That's a girl.

384
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,070
Sam!

385
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,400
I begged youto stop me,dean!

386
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,510
Put the knife down,damn it.

387
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,190
I told youI can't fight it!

388
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,960
My head feels likeit's on fire,all right?

389
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,200
Dean,kill me,or I'm gonna kill her.

390
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,020
Please.

391
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,200
You'd be doing me a favor.

392
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,720
Shoot me.

393
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,160
Shoot me!

394
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,780
No,sammy.Come on.

395
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,190
What the hell'swrong with you,dean?

396
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,710
Are you that scaredof being alone that you'd ratherlet jo die?

397
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,130
That's holy water,you demonic son of a bitch!

398
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,800
He was possessed?

399
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Dean!

400
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,200
- So,who are you?
- I got lots of names.

401
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,800
You've been in sam since he
disappeared,haven't you?

402
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,600
Should have seen your face when you thought
he murdered that guy.Pathetic.

403
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,900
Why didn't you kill me?
You had a dozen chances.

404
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,100
No,that would have been too easy.
Where's the fun in that?

405
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,000
See,this was a test.I wanted to see
if I could push you far enough to waste sam.

406
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,200
I should have known you wouldn't have the sack.

407
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,700
Anyway,fun's over now.

408
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,000
Well,I hope you got your kicks
'cause you're gonna pay hell for this.

409
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,900
How?You can't hurt me -
not without hurting your little brother.

410
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:44,500
See,I think you're gonna die,dean -
you and every other hunter I can find.

411
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,100
One look at sam's dewy,sensitive eyes,
and they'll let me right in that door.

412
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,600
This is dean.Leave a message.

413
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,900
Dean!

414
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,900
Dean!

415
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,500
Take it easy.

416
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,100
- Where's sam?
- I don't know.I've been looking for you.

417
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,800
Come on.Get up.

418
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,100
Okay.Don't be a baby!

419
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,200
God.

420
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,200
All right,almost.All right,got it.Got it.

421
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,200
- God,you're a butcher.
- You're welcome.

422
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,900
- All right,are we done?
- Would you give me two minutes to patch you up?

423
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,800
You can't help sam if you're bleeding to death.

424
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,700
So,how did you know that he was possessed?

425
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,400
I didn'T.I just knew that
it couldn't have been him.

426
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,700
- Hey,dean.
- Yeah.

427
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,100
I know demons lie,
but do they ever tell the truth,too?

428
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,700
yeah,sometimes,I guess,especially
if they know it'll mess with your head.

429
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,300
Why do you ask?

430
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,700
Nothing.It doesn't matter.

431
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,900
So,do you have any idea
where he's headed to next?

432
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:05,300
So far,he's been going after the nearest hunter,
so,the closest one I know is in south dakota.

433
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,600
Okay,good.I'm done.Let's go.

434
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,600
- You're not coming.
- The hell I'm not.I'm a part of this now.

435
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:19,000
I can't say it more plain than this - you try and follow me,
and I'll tie you right back to that post.

436
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,200
This is my fight.I'm not getting
your blood on my hands.

437
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,000
That's just how it's gonna be.

438
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,600
Wait.Here.

439
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,300
Take these.They'll help with the pain.

440
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,400
Thanks.

441
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
I'll call you later,okay?

442
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,400
No,you won'T.

443
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,200
Damn it.

444
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,000
- Sam.
- Hey,bobby.

445
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,600
It's been a while.Come on in.

446
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,100
- So,what brings you?
- Working a job nearby,and I thought I'd stop in and say hey.

447
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,300
Where's dean?

448
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,200
Holed up somewhere with a girland a 12-pack.

449
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:59,500
- Oh,yeah?Is she pretty?
- You ask me,he's in way over his head.

450
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,600
Well,it's good to see you.

451
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,600
To john.

452
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,600
To dad.

453
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,600
- What'd you do?
- Little holy water in the beer.

454
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,100
Sam never would have noticed,
but,then,you're not sam,are you?

455
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,300
Don't try to con a con man.

456
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,100
Ugh!

457
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,500
Dean.Back from the dead.

458
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,300
Getting to be a regular thing for you,isn't it?

459
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,200
Like a cockroach.

460
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,900
How about I smack that smart-ass
right out of your mouth?

461
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Careful now.

462
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,200
-Wouldn't want to bruise this fine packaging
- Oh,don't worry.This isn't gonna hurt sam much.

463
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,800
You,on the other hand...

464
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,300
Feel like talking now?

465
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,000
Sam's still my meat puppet.

466
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,700
- I'll make him bite off his tongue.
- No,you won't be in himlong enough.

467
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,300
Bobby.

468
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:56,500
ee,whatever bitch-boymaster plan you demons
are cooking up,you're not getting sam,you understand me?

469
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,700
'Cause I'm gonna kill every one of you first.

470
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,300
You really think that's whatthis is about-
the master plan?

471
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,100
I don't give a rat's ass about the master plan.

472
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,900
Oops.Doesn't seem to beworking.

473
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,600
See,I learned a few new tricks.

474
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,200
This isn't going like I pictured.
What's going on,bobby?

475
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,500
It's a binding link!

476
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,500
It's like a lock.It's locked
itself inside sam's body.

477
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,100
- What the hell do we do?
- I don't know!

478
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,800
There.That's better.

479
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,400
You know when people want to describe
the worst possible thing...

480
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,800
they say it's like hell?

481
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,000
Well,there's a reasonfor that.
Hell is like,uh...

482
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,800
well,it's like hell,even for demons.

483
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:49,600
It's a prison made of bone and
flesh and blood and fear.

484
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,800
And you sent me back there.

485
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:01,000
- Meg.
- No...not anymore.

486
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,900
Now I'm sam.

487
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,700
By the way...

488
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,500
I saw your dad there.He says "howdy."

489
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:18,200
All that I had to hold on to was that I would
climb out one day and that I was gonna torture you,

490
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,500
nice and slow,like pulling the wings off an insect.

491
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,900
But whatever I do to you,it's nothing compared
to what you do to yourself,is it?

492
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,500
I can see it in your eyes,dean.

493
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,300
You're worthless.You couldn't save your dad

494
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,800
and deep down,you know that
you can't save your brother.

495
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,900
They'd have been better off without you.

496
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,600
Sammy?

497
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,800
Did I miss anything?

498
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,500
By the way,you really look like crap,dean.

499
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
Yeah,right back at you.

500
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,500
What is it,bobby?

501
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,600
You boys ever hear of a hunter
named steve wandell?

502
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,800
Why do you ask?

503
00:38:54,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Just heard from a friend,wandell's dead-
murdered in his own house.

504
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,500
You wouldn't know anything about that.

505
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,300
- No,sir.Never heard of the guy.
- Dean.

506
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,900
Good.Keep it that way.

507
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,800
Wandell's buddies are looking for
someone or something to string up.

508
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,700
They're not gonna slow down to listen to reason.

509
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,100
You understand what I'm saying?

510
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,500
We better hit the road...

511
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,700
if,uh,you can remember where we parked the car.

512
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,800
Here.Take these.

513
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:35,400
- What are they?
- Charms.They'll fend off possession.

514
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,700
That demon's still out there.This will
stop it from getting back up in you.

515
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,700
- That sounds vaguely dirty,but,uh,thanks.
- You're welcome.

516
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,000
- You boys be careful,now.
- You too.

517
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,400
You okay?

518
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,700
Sam?

519
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,800
Is that you in there?

520
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,600
I was awake for some of it,dean.

521
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:38,300
I watched myself kill wandell with my own two hands.
I saw the light go out in his eyes.

522
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,200
It must have been awful.

523
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
That's not my point.

524
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,700
I almost carved up jo,too.

525
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,500
But no matter what I did,you wouldn't shoot.

526
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,600
It was the right move,sam.It wasn't you.

527
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,600
Yeah,this time.What about next time?

528
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:12,000
Sam,when dad told me that I might have to kill you,
it was only if I couldn't save you.

529
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,500
Now,if it's the last thing I do,
I'm gonna save you.

530
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:23,400
"I'm back on the road again I'm on my way "

531
