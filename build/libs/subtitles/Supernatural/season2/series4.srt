1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,795
Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off, saving people...

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,256
...hunting things, the family business.

3
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,635
Today's your lucky day, kid.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,764
- You watch out for Sammy, okay?
- Dad, you know I will.

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,474
Dad?

6
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,602
Time of death, 10:41 a.m.

7
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,856
I miss him, man. And I'm not all right.

8
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,775
- Neither are you.
- I'm dealing with Dad's death.

9
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,487
Dad's dead.
It hurts so bad you can't take it.

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,115
I'm okay.
The next person who asks me if I'm okay...

11
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,701
...I'm gonna start throwing punches.

12
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,209
Okay, we've got booze.

13
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:48,630
We've got chocolate.
And-- Wait for it.

14
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:52,509
-- tortured emo rock, a guaranteed cure
for any broken heart.

15
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,970
You didn't have to do all this.

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,514
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, I can see that.

17
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,145
Thanks, Neil.

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,315
You're a good friend.

19
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,983
Yeah.

20
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,613
Oh, God, it's probably him.

21
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,157
I'll take care of it.

22
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,372
- Where is she?
- Chill out. Think about this for a second.

23
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,917
- I need to talk to her.
- Some other time.

24
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,711
You get out of my face, Neil.

25
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,097
Angela?

26
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,616
Leave me alone.

27
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,243
Angela, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,869
You're sorry?

29
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,290
- You're sorry. Oh, that's great.
- Angela, listen to me.

30
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,668
I don't wanna listen to you.
I'm done listening.

31
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,795
- Listen to me.
- No...

32
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,172
I loved you.

33
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,819
Angela?

34
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,447
Angela?

35
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,922
Come on, Sam, I'm begging you.
This is stupid.

36
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,675
- Why?
- Going to visit Mom's grave?

37
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,095
She doesn't have a grave.
There was no body left after the fire.

38
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,390
- She has a headstone.
- Yeah, put up by a man we've never met.

39
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:07,102
So you wanna go pay your respects
to a slab of granite put up by a stranger?

40
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,646
- That's not the point.
- Well, then, enlighten me.

41
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,566
It's not about a body or a casket.

42
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,818
It's about her memory, okay?

43
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,280
And after Dad,
it just feels like the right thing to do.

44
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,992
- It's irrational, is what it is.
- Look, man, no one asked you to come.

45
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,246
Why don't we swing by the Roadhouse?
We haven't heard anything on the demon.

46
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,207
We should be hunting that son of a bitch.

47
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,585
That's a good idea. You should.
Just drop me off. I'll hitch a ride...

48
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,671
- ...and I'll meet you there tomorrow.
- Right.

49
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:40,886
I'd be stuck with those people, making
awkward small talk until you show up.

50
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,804
No, thanks.

51
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,379
I think, um...

52
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,050
I think Dad would have wanted you
to have these.

53
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,148
I love you, Mom.

54
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,106
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

55
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,192
Angela Mason.

56
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,112
She was a student at the local college.
Funeral was three days ago.

57
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,615
And?

58
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,118
You saw her grave. Everything dead
around it in a perfect circle.

59
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:13,997
- You don't think that's a little weird?
- Maybe the groundskeeper went aggro...

60
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,957
- ...with the pesticide.
- No, I asked him.

61
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,127
No pesticide, no chemicals.
Nobody can explain it.

62
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,463
Okay. So, what are you thinking?

63
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,840
I don't know. Unholy ground, maybe.

64
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,300
Un--?

65
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,676
What?

66
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,013
If something evil happened,
it could easily poison the ground.

67
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,224
Remember the farm
outside of Cedar Rapids?

68
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,768
- Yeah.
- Could be the sign of a demonic presence.

69
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,523
Or the Angela girl's spirit,
if it's powerful enough.

70
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,735
Don't get too excited,
you might pull something.

71
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,655
It's just, stumbling onto a hunt?

72
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,908
- Here, of all places?
- So?

73
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,994
Are you sure this is about a hunt?
Not about something else?

74
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,038
What else would it be about?

75
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,585
- You know, just forget it.
- You can believe what you want, Sam.

76
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:04,339
But I let you drag my ass out here.
Least we can do is check this out.

77
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,009
Yep. Fine.

78
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,513
Girl's dad works in town.
He's a professor at the school.

79
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,399
Hey.
Hi. Good to see you.

80
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,947
- Dr. Mason?
- Yes.

81
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,199
I'm Sam. This is Dean.

82
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,618
We were friends of Angela's. We...

83
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,246
We wanted to offer our condolences.

84
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,707
Please, come in.

85
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,887
- She was beautiful.
- Yes, she was.

86
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,557
This is an unusual book.

87
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,646
Oh, it's Ancient Greek. I teach a course.

88
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,574
So a car accident, that's...
That's horrible.

89
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:17,078
Angie was only a mile away
from home when, uh...

90
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,915
It's gotta be hard...

91
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,250
...losing someone like that.

92
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:27,380
Sometimes it's like
they're still around...

93
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,092
...almost like
you can still sense their presence.

94
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,180
- You ever feel anything like that?
- I do, as a matter of fact.

95
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,101
That's perfectly normal, Dr. Mason.

96
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,897
Especially with what
you're going through.

97
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,942
You know, I still phone her.

98
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,279
And the phone's ringing
before I remember that, uh...

99
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,118
Family's everything, you know?

100
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,956
Angie was the most important thing
in my life.

101
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,543
And now, well, I'm just lost without her.

102
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,551
We're very sorry.

103
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,139
There's something going on.
We just haven't found it yet.

104
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:22,310
Dean, so far you got a patch
of dead grass and nothing.

105
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,980
Something turned that grave
into unholy ground.

106
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,148
There's no reason
for it to be unholy ground.

107
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,651
Angela Mason was a nice girl
who died in a car crash.

108
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,363
That's not exactly vengeful-spirit material.
You heard her father.

109
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:37,200
Maybe Daddy doesn't know everything
there is to know about his little angel.

110
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,745
You know what? We never
should've bothered that poor man.

111
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,165
- We shouldn't even be here anymore.
- So, what, Sam? We just bail?

112
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,002
Without even figuring out
what's going on?

113
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,671
I think I know what's going on here.

114
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,340
It's the only reason
I went along with you this far.

115
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,343
- What are you talking about?
- This is about Mom's grave.

116
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:01,391
- It's got nothing to do with it.
- You wouldn't step within 100 yards of it.

117
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,186
Look, maybe you're imagining a hunt
where there isn't one...

118
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,189
...so you don't have to think
about Mom or Dad.

119
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,035
You wanna take another swing?

120
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,622
Go ahead, if it'll make you feel better.

121
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,791
I don't need this crap.

122
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:35,634
- Dean, where are you going?
- I'm gonna go get a drink. Alone.

123
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,396
Seriously, get that camera out of my face.

124
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,650
What, you shy?
I am, as a matter of fact.

125
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,735
Then maybe this'll help you overcome it.

126
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:54,903
I hate you.

127
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,822
Oh, liar. You're crazy about me
and you know it.

128
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,282
Shut up.

129
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,286
You know, I just had an idea. We can
make a whole different kind of video.

130
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,046
You jerk.

131
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,968
Yeah, but I'm your jerk.
- Please turn the camera off.

132
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,937
You're beautiful, you know that?
You know that, right?

133
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,543
- Who the hell are you?
- Wait, wait, wait.

134
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,546
- Hold on.
- I'm calling 911!

135
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,132
- I'm Angela's cousin.
- What?

136
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,385
Yeah, her dad sent me over
to, uh, pick up her stuff.

137
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:46,097
My name's Allan. Allan Stanwick.

138
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,061
Her dad didn't say
that you were coming.

139
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,606
Well, I mean...

140
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,943
...how else would I have the key
to your place?

141
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:14,501
So I'm sure you got a view of Angela
that none of the family got to see.

142
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,461
Tell me, what was she like?

143
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,506
- What was she really like?
- She was great.

144
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,635
Just great.

145
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,762
I mean, she was so...

146
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,143
- Great.
- Yeah.

147
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,063
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

148
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,274
There you go.

149
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,152
You two must've been
really close, huh?

150
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,781
We were.

151
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,742
But it's not just her. It's Matt.

152
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,079
- Who?
- Angela's boyfriend.

153
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,331
Right, Matt.

154
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,627
- Um, what about him?
- He killed himself last night.

155
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,255
He cut his own throat.
Who does that?

156
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,092
That's terrible.

157
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:08,596
He was taking Angela's death
pretty hard, and I guess...

158
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:14,561
- He'd been messed up about it for days.
- Messed up how?

159
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,438
He kept saying
that he saw her everywhere.

160
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,942
Well, I'm sure that that's normal. I mean,
with everything that he was going through.

161
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,611
He said that he saw her.

162
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,114
As in an acid trip or something.

163
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,702
Were Angela and Matt a happy couple?

164
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,371
Was there any reason
Angela would be angry with him?

165
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,331
What?

166
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,834
No, of course not. Why do you ask?

167
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,336
Just asking.

168
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,008
Where did Matt live?

169
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,926

00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:52,015
Casa Erotica 4:
A Tale of Two Latin Beauties.

171
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,059
Hey.

172
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,480
What?

173
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,190
Awkward.

174
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:05,236
- Where the hell were you?
- Just working my imaginary case.

175
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,363
Yeah, and...?

176
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,033
Oh, well, you were right.
I didn't find much.

177
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,828
Yeah. Except Angela's boyfriend
died last night, slit his own throat.

178
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,040
But, you know, that's normal.
Uh, let's see. What else?

179
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,459
Oh, he was seeing Angela everywhere
before he died.

180
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,172
But, you know, I'm sure that's just me
transferring my own feelings.

181
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,508
Okay, I get it. I'm sorry.
Maybe there is something going on here.

182
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:33,097
Maybe? Sam, I know how to do my job,
despite what you might think.

183
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,268
We should check out
the guy's apartment.

184
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,479
I just came from there.

185
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,440
A pile of dead plants,
just like the cemetery.

186
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,983
Hell, dead goldfish too.

187
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,028
- So unholy ground?
- Maybe.

188
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:51,282
I'm still not getting that powerful
angry-spirit vibe from Angela.

189
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,326
I have been reading this, though.

190
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,291
You stole the girl's diary?

191
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,460
Yeah, Sam.

192
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,547
- If anything, the girl's a little too nice.
- So, what do you wanna do?

193
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,592
- Keep digging, talk to her friends.
- You get any names?

194
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,219
You kidding me?

195
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,097
I have her bestest friend
in the whole wide world.

196
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,768
I didn't realize the college employed
grief counselors.

197
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,646
Oh, yeah. Yeah, you talk, we listen.

198
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,817
Maybe throw in a therapeutic collage.
Whatever helps jump-start the healing.

199
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,987
Well, I think I'm okay. Thanks.

200
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,906
Well, you heard what happened
to Matt Harrison, right?

201
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,449
Yeah, I did.

202
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,202
We just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

203
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,455
Grief can make people do crazy things.

204
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,794
Look, I'm sorry
about what happened to him. I am.

205
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,880
But if Matt killed himself,
it wasn't because of grief.

206
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,550
- No? Then why?
- It was guilt.

207
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,596
- Angie's death was Matt's fault.
- How was Matt responsible?

208
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,182
She really loved that guy.

209
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,270
But the night of the accident,
she walked in on him with another girl.

210
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,896
Hmm.

211
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,899
She was really torn up.
That's why she crashed the car.

212
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,362
Um, look, I gotta get ready for work.

213
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:16,576
So thanks for the concern,
but seriously, I'll be okay.

214
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,375
Well, that vengeful-spirit theory
is starting to make sense.

215
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,711
I mean, hell hath no fury.

216
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,173
So if Angela got her revenge on Matt,
you think it's over?

217
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,343
Well, there's one way to be sure.

218
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,430
Yeah?

219
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,599
- What's that?
- Burn the bones.

220
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,060
Burn the bones?

221
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,604
Are you high?

222
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,939
- Angela died last week.
- So?

223
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,816
There's not gonna be bones.

224
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,861
There's gonna be a ripe, rotting body
in the coffin.

225
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,072
Since when are you afraid
to get dirty, huh?

226
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,892
Ladies first.

227
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,480
Hold that.

228
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,809
I missed you.

229
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,418
They buried the body four days ago.

230
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,711
I don't get it.

231
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,630
Look.

232
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,052
What is that?
I'm not sure.

233
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,098
I've seen
these kinds of symbols before.

234
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,061
Dean, take it easy. Okay?

235
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,237
You're Angie's friends, right?

236
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,822
- Dr. Mason--
- We need to talk.

237
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,367
Well, then, come in.

238
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,745
Thanks.

239
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:13,169
You teach Ancient Greek. Tell me...

240
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,296
...what are these?

241
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,799
I don't understand.

242
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,594
You said this had something to do
with Angela.

243
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,513
It does. Please, just humor me.

244
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,310
They're part of an Ancient Greek
divination ritual.

245
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,813
- Used for necromancy, right?
- That's right.

246
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,525
Before we came here, we stopped by
the library and did a little homework.

247
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,655
Apparently, they use rituals like this one
for communicating with the dead.

248
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:44,283
Even bringing corpses back to life,
full-on zombie action.

249
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,452
Yeah.

250
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,121
I mean, according to the legends.

251
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,709
- Now, what's all this about?
- I think you know.

252
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,837
- Dean.
- Look, I get it.

253
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,757
Okay? There are people
that I would give anything to see.

254
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,634
- But what gives you the right?
- Dean.

255
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,803
- What?
- What's dead should stay dead.

256
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,346
- What?
- What you brought back...

257
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:09,100
...isn't even your daughter.
These things are vicious. They're violent.

258
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,143
They're so nasty, they rot the ground.

259
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,521
I mean, come on,
haven't you seen Pet Sematary?

260
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,940
You're insane.

261
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,985
- Where is she?
- Get out of my house.

262
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,071
I know you're hiding her somewhere.
Where is she?

263
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,365
Dean, stop. That's enough.
Dean, look.

264
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,784
Beautiful, living plants.

265
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,412
- We're leaving.
- I'm calling the police.

266
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,748
Sir, we're sorry.
We won't bother you again.

267
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,587
- What is the matter with you?
- Back off.

268
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,881
That man is innocent.
He didn't deserve that.

269
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,925
Maybe he's keeping her
somewhere else.

270
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,136
Stop it. That's enough, okay? Enough.

271
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,014
- Sam, I know what I'm doing.
- No, you don't. At all.

272
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,225
Dean, I don't scare easy,
but you're scaring the crap out of me.

273
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,395
- Don't be dramatic.
- You're lucky this turned out to be a case.

274
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,565
Because if it wasn't,
you would've found something else to kill.

275
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,526
You're on edge. You're erratic.
Except for when you're hunting...

276
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,696
...because then you're downright scary.
You're tailspinning, man.

277
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,700
And you refuse to talk about it,
and you won't let me help you.

278
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,995
- I can take care of myself, thanks.
- No, you can't.

279
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,332
You know what? You're the only one
who thinks you should have to.

280
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,001
You don't have to handle this on your own.
No one can.

281
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:21,589
- If you bring up Dad's death one more time--
- Stop. Please. Dean, it's killing you. Please.

282
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,675
We've already lost Dad.

283
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,219
We've lost Mom.

284
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,929
I've lost Jessica.

285
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,933
And now I'm gonna lose you too?

286
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,813
We better get out of here
before the cops come.

287
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:44,236
I hear you. Okay?
Yeah, I'm being an ass. And I'm sorry.

288
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:48,449
But we got a zombie running around.
We need to figure out how to kill it.

289
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,661
Right?

290
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,538
Our lives are weird, man.

291
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,582
You're telling me.

292
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,002
Come on.

293
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,131
Honey, is something bothering you?

294
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,719
It's about Matt.

295
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,305
- Haven't we talked about that?
- I know, but--

296
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,016
Haven't we wasted
enough time on him already?

297
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,812
Come sit down.

298
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,155
You always said
that he didn't deserve me.

299
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,452
- You were right.
- Angela...

300
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,624
...you didn't get out
and go see Matt, or...?

301
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,210
I've been here the whole time.

302
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:46,715
Neil, you really think
I could do something like that?

303
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,551
No.

304
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,554
I don't know. I can't help it.

305
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,265
- You just-- You seem--
- Different?

306
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,478
You're right. I am.

307
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,358
I've realized...

308
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,236
...you're the only one
who ever really loved me.

309
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,199
You proved that.

310
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,076
You brought me back.

311
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,079
I'm with you now.

312
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,708
Isn't that what you always wanted?

313
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,547
We can't just waste it
with a headshot?

314
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,508
Dude, you've been watching
way too many Romero flicks.

315
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:34,054
- So there's no lore on how to smoke them?
- No, Dean, I'm telling you there's too much.

316
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,182
There's a hundred legends
on the walking dead...

317
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:40,478
...but they all have different methods for
killing them. Some say setting them on fire.

318
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,396
One said-- Where is it?

319
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,565
Right here.
-- feeding their hearts to wild dogs.

320
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,233
That's my personal favorite.

321
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,194
Who knows what's real
and what's myth?

322
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:52,031
- Is there anything they have in common?
- No. A few said silver might work.

323
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,326
- Silver's a start.
- Yeah. But how are we gonna find Angela?

324
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,120
- We gotta figure out who brought her back.
- Any ideas?

325
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,540
I think if it's not her dad,
it might be that guy Neil.

326
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,042
- Neil?
- Yep.

327
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,879
- How'd you come up with that?
- Well, you got your journal, I got mine.

328
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,839
"Neil's a real shoulder to cry on.

329
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,259
He so understands
what I'm going through with Matt."

330
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:16,388
There's more in here where that came from.
It's got unrequited Duckie love all over it.

331
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,266
But that doesn't mean
he brought her back from the dead.

332
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,644
Mm. Did I mention that
he's Professor Mason's TA?

333
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,355
Has access to all the same books?

334
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,570
Hello?

335
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,992
Neil.

336
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:41,205
It's your grief counselors.
We've come to hug.

337
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,501
Silver bullets?

338
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,671
Yeah, enough to make her rattle
like a change purse.

339
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,616
Unless this is where
he keeps his porn.

340
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:49,440
- Sure looks like a zombie pen to me.
- Yeah.

341
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,442
An empty one.

342
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,946
You think Angela's
going after somebody?

343
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,499
No, I think she went out
to rent Beaches.

344
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,544
Look, smart-ass,
she might kill someone.

345
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,047
We gotta find her, Dean.

346
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,132
Yeah.

347
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,345
All right, she clipped Matt
because he was cheating, right?

348
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,306
- Yeah.
- Well, it takes two to, you know...

349
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,725
...have hardcore sex.

350
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:29,313
I don't know, it just seemed that
Angela's roommate...

351
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,691
...was broken up over Matt's death.

352
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,819
I mean, like, really broken up.

353
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,965
Hello?

354
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,350
Hi, Lindsey. I'm home.

355
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,114
You know what you did.

356
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,743
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

357
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,495
You're not sorry enough!

358
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,936
Oh, God.

359
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,814
Oh, God.

360
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,734
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

361
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,682
Hey, I got you. I got you.

362
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,771
Damn, that dead chick can run.

363
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,773
What now?

364
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,193
I say we go have
a little chat with Neil.

365
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,532
So the silver bullets,
they did something, right?

366
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,827
Yeah, something. But not enough.
What else you got?

367
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,329
Um...

368
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:55,250
Okay, besides silver, we have nailing
the undead back into their grave beds.

369
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,505
It's mentioned a few times. It's probably
where the vampire-staking lore came from.

370
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,841
- Their grave beds? You serious?
- Yeah.

371
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:06,220
How the hell are we gonna get
Angela back to the cemetery?

372
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,858
What are you guys doing here?

373
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:25,906
I've heard of some people doing some
desperate things to get laid, but you...

374
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,116
You take the cake.

375
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,743
Okay, who are you guys?

376
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,496
You might wanna ask Angela
that question.

377
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,790
- What?
- We know what you did.

378
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,750
The ritual.

379
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,919
Everything.

380
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,380
Crazy.

381
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,842
Your girlfriend's past her expiration date
and we're crazy?

382
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,636
When someone's gone,
they should stay gone.

383
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,514
You don't mess
with that kind of stuff.

384
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,766
Angela killed Matt.

385
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,518
She tried to kill Lindsey.

386
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,939
I don't know
what you're talking about.

387
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,110
- Hey.
No more crap, Neil.

388
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,653
His blood is on your hands.

389
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:09,449
Now, me and him can make this right,
but you gotta tell us where she is.

390
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,369
Tell us!

391
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,416
My house. She's at my house.

392
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,512
Are you sure about that?

393
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:43,734
Listen, it doesn't really matter
where she is.

394
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,320
There's only one way to stop her.

395
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,739
We've gotta perform another ritual
over her grave.

396
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,325
To reverse the one that you did.

397
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,620
We're gonna need some black root,
some scar weed, some candles.

398
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,249
It's complicated, but it'll get the job done.
She'll be dead again in a couple hours.

399
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,752
I think you should come with us.

400
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,966
I'm serious, Neil.
Leave with us, right now.

401
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,344
No.

402
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,387
No.

403
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,519
Listen to me.

404
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,773
Get out of here as soon as you can.

405
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,942
But most of all, be cool.

406
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,361
No sudden movements.

407
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,987
Don't make her mad.

408
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,952
Let's go.

409
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,429
- You said you'd stay in the house.
I'm sorry.

410
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,598
I just needed to see you.

411
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,100
Neil, please.

412
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,562
You have to help me.

413
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,485
Oh, God.

414
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,278
Come with me to the cemetery.

415
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,323
Neil, they're trying to kill me.
We have to stop them.

416
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,908
You mean kill them.

417
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,954
It's true.

418
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,039
- Matt and Lindsey.
- They hurt me.

419
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,419
If you love me,
you'll make sure nobody hurts me again.

420
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,172
Take me to the cemetery,
and then all this will be over.

421
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,800
We can start new lives together.

422
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,263
Okay.

423
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,225
God help me, but okay.

424
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,562
I'll go get the car.

425
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,940
Just... Just wait here.

426
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,049
Neil, you look nervous.

427
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,718
No, I'm fine.

428
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,139
Were you going to leave me?

429
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,851
- No, of course not. I--
- You were, weren't you?

430
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,771
How could you?

431
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,190
- Neil, I loved you.
- Angela--

432
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,705
You really think this is gonna work?

433
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,999
No, not really.

434
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,004
But it was the only thing
I could come up with.

435
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,229
Wait. It's not what you think.

436
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,732
I didn't ask to be brought back.
But it's still me.

437
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,360
I'm still a person. Please.

438
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,273
Wait, don't!

439
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,876
What's dead should stay dead.

440
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,972
- Rest in peace.
- Yeah. For good this time, okay?

441
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:18,485
You know, the whole fake-ritual thing,
luring Angela into the cemetery...

442
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,903
...pretty sharp.

443
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,655
Thanks.

444
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,324
But did we have to use me as bait?

445
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:28,453
I figured you were more her type.
She had pretty crappy taste in guys.

446
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,122
I think she broke my hand.

447
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,168
You're just too fragile.
We'll get it looked at later.

448
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,259
You wanna stay for a while?

449
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,640
No.

450
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,251
Dean, what is it?

451
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,133
- I'm sorry.
- You--?

452
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,344
For what?

453
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,431
The way I've been acting.

454
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,659
And for Dad.

455
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,748
I mean, he was your dad too.

456
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,961
- And it's my fault that he's gone.
- What are you talking about?

457
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,798
I know you've been thinking it.
So have I.

458
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,967
Doesn't take a genius to figure it out.

459
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:53,973
Back at the hospital,
you know, full recovery.

460
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,226
It was a miracle.

461
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,437
And five minutes later,
Dad's dead and the Colt's gone.

462
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,565
You can't tell me
there's not a connection there.

463
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,987
I don't know how
the demon was involved.

464
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,699
I don't know how
the whole thing went down, exactly.

465
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,286
But Dad's dead because of me.

466
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:20,083
- And that much I do know.
- We don't know that. Not for sure.

467
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,793
Sam...

468
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,714
...you and Dad...

469
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,470
...you're the most important people
in my life.

470
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,931
And now...

471
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,854
I never should've come back, Sam.
It wasn't natural.

472
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,441
And now look what's come of it.

473
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,112
I was dead.

474
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,615
And I should have stayed dead.

475
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,542
You wanted to know
how I was feeling.

476
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,379
Well, that's it.

477
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,176
So tell me...

478
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,851
...what could you possibly say
to make that all right?
