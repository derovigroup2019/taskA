1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:04,378
Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off.

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:08,048
Saving people, hunting things.
The family business.

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,803
You know the truth about Sammy?

4
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,347
I've known for a while.

5
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,600
You get premonitions of people
about to die?

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,061
- Death visions?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,274
The demon said he had plans for me.

8
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,609
- Do you have any idea what he meant?
- No.

9
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,987
I want you to watch out
for Sammy, okay?

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,824
Did he say anything to you?

11
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:35,951
No.

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,664
Can't talk about this to Sammy.
Gotta keep my game face on.

13
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,583
You're on edge. You're erratic.

14
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,627
Except for when you're hunting,
then you're downright scary.

15
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,589
The truth is
I'm not handling it very well.

16
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,510
You're tailspinning, man.
And you won't let me help you.

17
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,292
No, no, no. You're not gonna...

18
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,961
No, I swear, it's not in me.

19
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,506
Oh, God. We're all gonna die.

20
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,467
- Maybe he's telling the truth.
- He's not him, not anymore.

21
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,637
No, stop. Stop it!
Ask her! Ask the doctor!

22
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,765
- It's not in me!
- I just...

23
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,309
I can't tell.

24
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,770
No, please. Don't, don't.

25
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,106
- I swear, I swear.
- I got no choice.

26
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,150
It's not in me. It's not in me.

27
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,280
Don't. Don't.

28
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,575
Please.

29
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,674
Sam?

30
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,984
Continue on OR-224 west.

31
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,528
There are two towns in the U.S.
named Rivergrove.

32
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,156
How come you're so sure
it's the one in Oregon?

33
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,912
There was a picture of Crater Lake.

34
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,414
Okay, what else?

35
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:50,586
I saw a dark room, some people,
and a guy tied to a chair.

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,421
And I ventilated him?

37
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,673
Yeah.

38
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,925
You thought
there was something inside him.

39
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,094
- A demon? Was he possessed?
- I don't know.

40
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,930
All your visions are tied
to the yellow-eyed demon.

41
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,683
Was there any black smoke?
Did we try to exorcise him?

42
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,645
No, nothing.
You just plugged him. That's it.

43
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,439
I'm sure I had a good reason.

44
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,441
I sure hope so.

45
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,235
What does that mean?

46
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,199
I mean, I'm not gonna waste
an innocent man.

47
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,160
- I wouldn't.
- Never said you would.

48
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,536
- Fine.
- Fine.

49
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,206
We don't know what it is,
but whatever it is...

50
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,876
...that guy in the chair is part of it.
Let's find him, see what's what.

51
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,502
- Fine.
- Fine.

52
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,506
He was there.

53
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,470
- Morning.
- Morning.

54
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,347
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

55
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,850
Billy Gibbons, Frank Beard.
U.S. Marshals.

56
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,770
- What's this about?
- We're looking for someone.

57
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,523
A young man, early 20s.

58
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:39,444
He'd have a thin scar
right below his hairline.

59
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,989
- What'd he do?
- Well, nothing.

60
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,284
We're looking for someone else.
We think this young man can help.

61
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,869
He's not in any trouble or anything.
Well, not yet.

62
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,252
I think maybe you know
who he is, master sergeant.

63
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,463
My dad was in the Corps.
A corporal.

64
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,757
- What company?
- Echo 21.

65
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,217
So can you help us?

66
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,766
Duane Tanner's got a scar like that.

67
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,686
But I know him.
Good kid, keeps his nose clean.

68
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,564
Oh, I'm sure he does.
Do you know where he lives?

69
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:20,068
With his family, up Aspen Way.

70
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,529
Thank you.

71
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,836
Hey.

72
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,096
"Croatoan"?
- Yeah.

73
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,267
Roanoke? Lost colony? Ring a bell?

74
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,604
Dean, did you pay
any attention in history class?

75
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:00,525
Yeah. The shot heard around the world,
how bills become laws.

76
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,695
That's not school.
That's Schoolhouse Rock!

77
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,865
Whatever.

78
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,827
Roanoke was one of the first
English colonies in America, late 1500s.

79
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,747
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I do remember that.

80
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:17,209
The only thing they left behind
was a single word carved in a tree.

81
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,127
- Croatoan.
- Yeah.

82
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,089
And, I mean, there were theories,
Indian raid, disease.

83
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:25,092
Nobody knows what really happened.
They were all just gone.

84
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,760
I mean, wiped out overnight.

85
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,722
You don't think that's what's
going on here? I mean...

86
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,975
Whatever I saw in my head,
it sure wasn't good.

87
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,438
But what do you think could do that?

88
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:44,319
Well, I mean, like I said,
all your weirdo visions...

89
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,572
...are always tied to
the yellow-eyed demon somehow, so...

90
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,701
We should get help.
Bobby, Ellen, maybe.

91
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,745
Yeah, that's a good idea.

92
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,253
I don't have a signal.

93
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,094
I don't either.

94
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,606
Line's dead.

95
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,401
I'll tell you one thing.

96
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,488
If I was gonna massacre a town,
that'd be my first step.

97
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,884
- Yeah?
- Hi.

98
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,303
Looking for Duane Tanner.
He lives here, right?

99
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,306
- He's my brother.
Can we talk to him?

100
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,601
- He's not here right now.
- You know where he is?

101
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,812
Yeah. He went on a fishing trip
up by Roslyn Lake.

102
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,023
- Your parents home?
- Yeah, they're inside.

103
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,025
Jake, who is it?

104
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,113
U.S. Marshals, sir.
We're looking for your son Duane.

105
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,823
Why? He's not in trouble, is he?

106
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,618
No. We just need to ask him
a couple routine questions.

107
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,329
When's he due back from his trip?

108
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,541
- I'm not sure.
- Well, maybe your wife knows.

109
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,085
You know, I don't know.
She's not here right now.

110
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,254
Well, your son said she was.

111
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,341
- Did I?
- She's getting groceries.

112
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,802
When Duane gets back,
there's a number where he can get you?

113
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,805
Oh, no,
we'll just check in with you later.

114
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,064
That was kind of creepy, right?

115
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,234
- Little too Stepford?
- Bigtime.

116
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,498
It's okay, Mom. It's not gonna hurt.

117
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,103
- No!
- Put it down.

118
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,270
Hello?

119
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,480
Hello, we need a doctor here.

120
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,276
Mrs. Tanner, what happened?

121
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,486
- She's been attacked.
- Dr. Lee?

122
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,283
It's okay.

123
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,910
- Bring her in.
- Okay.

124
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,582
Okay.
- Hey.

125
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,834
Is that...?

126
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,878
Mr. Tanner?

127
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,880
Was he attacked too?

128
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:36,009
No, actually, he did the attacking
and then he got himself shot.

129
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,385
- Shot?
- Yeah.

130
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,554
- And who are you?
- U.S. Marshal.

131
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,723
I'd show you my badge, but...

132
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,392
Oh, sorry. Bring him back here.

133
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,688
Wait, you said Jake helped him?

134
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,523
Your son Jake?

135
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,568
They beat me.

136
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,404
Tied me up.

137
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,700
- I don't believe it.
Pam.

138
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,746
Beverly, you have any idea
why they would act this way?

139
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,750
- Any history of chemical dependency?
No, of course not.

140
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,752
I don't know why.

141
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,423
One minute,
they were my husband and my son...

142
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,761
...and the next,
they had the devil in them.

143
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,766
We gotta talk.

144
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,732
Those guys were whacked out
of their gourds.

145
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,610
What do you think?
Multiple demons, mass possession?

146
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,780
If it's a possession, there could be more.
God knows how many.

147
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,282
It could be like a frigging
Shriner convention.

148
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,244
- Great.
- That's one way to wipe out a town.

149
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,954
- Take it from the inside.
- I don't know.

150
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,416
We didn't see any demon smoke
or any of the other usual signs.

151
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,460
Well, whatever.
Something turned him into a monster.

152
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,965
If you'd taken out the other one,
there'd be one less to worry about.

153
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,926
I'm sorry, all right?
I hesitated, Dean. It was a kid.

154
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,428
No, it was an it.

155
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,680
Not the best time
for a bleeding heart, Sam.

156
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,933
- How's the patient?
- Terrible.

157
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,977
- What the hell happened?
- We don't know.

158
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,646
- You just killed my neighbor.
- Didn't have a choice.

159
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,524
Maybe, but we need
the county sheriff. I need the coroner.

160
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,693
- Phones are down.
- I know, I tried.

161
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,778
- Tell me you got a police radio.
- We do.

162
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,989
But it crapped out,
like everything else.

163
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,991
I don't understand.

164
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,161
- How far to the next town?
- About 40 miles down to Sidewinder.

165
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,621
I'll go there
and see if I can find some help.

166
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,916
My partner will stick around,
keep you guys safe.

167
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,668
Safe from what?

168
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,922
We'll get back to you on that.

169
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,048
Huh.

170
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,927
What?

171
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,721
His lymphocyte percentage
is pretty high.

172
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,057
His body was fighting off
a viral infection.

173
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,769
- Really? What kind of virus?
- Can't say for sure.

174
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,313
Think an infection could've
made him act like that?

175
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,898
None that I've ever heard of.

176
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,943
Some can cause dementia,
but not that kind of violence.

177
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,280
Besides, I've never heard of one
that did this to the blood.

178
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,949
- Did what?
- There's this weird residue.

179
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,412
If I didn't know better,
I'd say it was sulfur.

180
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,628
Sulfur.

181
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,874
- Oh. Hey.
- Sorry, road's closed.

182
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,668
Yeah, I can see that. What's up?

183
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,503
- Quarantine.
- Quarantine?

184
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,465
- What is it?
- Don't know.

185
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,842
Something going around out there.

186
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,886
- Who told you that?
- County sheriff.

187
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,806
- Is he here?
- No. He called.

188
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,685
Say, why don't you get out of the car
and we'll talk a little?

189
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,856
Oh, you're a handsome devil,
but I don't swing that way, sorry.

190
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,027
I'd sure appreciate it if you got out
of the car, just for a quick minute.

191
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,739
Yeah, I bet you would.

192
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,010
I don't understand.

193
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,932
Are you saying my husband
and Jake had a disease?

194
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,184
That's what we're trying
to find out.

195
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,562
Now, during the attack,
do you remember...

196
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,400
...did you have any direct contact
with their blood?

197
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,693
Oh, my God.

198
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,071
You don't think
I've got this virus, do you?

199
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,949
Beverly, I don't know what to think.

200
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,910
But with your permission,
we'll take a blood sample.

201
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,486
- Hands where I can see them!
- Son of a--

202
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,447
Get out of the car!

203
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,991
Out of the car!

204
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,329
All right, easy there, big guy.

205
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,835
- Put it down! Down!
- Lower it now! You one of them?

206
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,462
- No, you? Could be lying.
- No.

207
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,422
- So could you.
- All right. All right.

208
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:35,219
We could do this all day, all right? Let's
take it easy before we kill each other.

209
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,433
- What's going on with everybody?
- I don't know.

210
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,518
My neighbor, Mr. Rogers...

211
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,772
- You got a neighbor named Mr. Rogers?
- Not anymore.

212
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,651
He came at me with a hatchet.
I put him down.

213
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,696
He's not the only one.
It's happening to everyone.

214
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,365
I'm heading to doc's place.
There's some people left.

215
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,326
- I'm getting out.
- There's no way out.

216
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,744
They got the bridge.

217
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,955
- I don't believe you.
- Fine, stay here. Be my guest.

218
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,058
Well, this ought to be a relaxing drive.

219
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,566
What if we all have it?

220
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,195
- What if we all go crazy?
- You've gotta stay calm.

221
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,031
All we can do is wait.
The marshal's bringing help.

222
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,783
I can't, I...

223
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,035
No, I've gotta go.

224
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,037
Pam.
No, you don't understand.

225
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,082
My boyfriend's out there.
I gotta make sure he's okay.

226
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,881
Hey, hey, wait. Wait, please.

227
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:58,719
I know you're upset, all right?
But it's safer if you stay here for now.

228
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,721
Help is coming.

229
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,812
There they are.

230
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,065
Sammy! Open up!

231
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,617
Did you guys get to a phone?
Roadblock.

232
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,121
- I'm gonna have a word. Doc's inside.
- All right.

233
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,373
What's going on out there?

234
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,585
I don't know. I feel like
Chuck Heston in The Omega Man.

235
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,420
The sarge is the only sane person.

236
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,923
- What are we dealing with? You know?
- Yeah, doc thinks it's a virus.

237
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,843
- Okay, great. What do you think?
- I think she's right.

238
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,386
- Really?
- Yeah.

239
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,431
The infected are trying to infect others
with blood-to-blood contact.

240
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,893
It gets better. The virus leaves
traces of sulfur in the blood.

241
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,937
- A demonic virus?
- Yeah, more like demonic germ warfare.

242
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,566
At least it explains
why I've been having visions.

243
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,903
- It's like a Biblical plague.
- Yeah.

244
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,280
You don't know
how right you are, Dean.

245
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,407
I've been poring
through Dad's journal.

246
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,451
Found something
about the Roanoke colony.

247
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,995
- And?
- Dad had a theory about Croatoan.

248
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,415
He thought it was a demon's name,
known as Dever or Reshef.

249
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,959
A demon of plague and pestilence.

250
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,754
Well, that's terrific.
Why here? Why now?

251
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,130
I have no idea.

252
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,635
But, Dean, I mean, who knows
how far this thing can spread.

253
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,012
We gotta get out of here.
We gotta warn people.

254
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,972
They've got one. In here.

255
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,519
What do you mean?
The wife. She's infected.

256
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,397
We gotta take care of this.
We can't leave her in there.

257
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,191
My neighbors, they were strong.

258
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,526
The longer we wait,
the stronger she'll get.

259
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,327
You're gonna kill Beverly Tanner.

260
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:50,498
Doctor, could there be any treatment?
Some kind of cure for this?

261
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,836
- Can you cure it?
- I don't even know what it is.

262
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,797
I told you, it's a matter of time.

263
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,675
Just leave her there.
You can't shoot her like an animal.

264
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,468
Sam.

265
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,657
Mark. What are you doing?

266
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,077
Mark, it's them.

267
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,539
They locked me in here.
They tried to kill me.

268
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,666
They're infected, not me.

269
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,585
Please, Mark.

270
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:41,215
You've known me all your life. Please.

271
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,719
You're sure she's one of them?

272
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,597
Yeah.

273
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,445
Ah! Oh, God. Is there any on me?

274
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,781
- Am I okay?
- You're clean. You're okay.

275
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,158
Why are we staying here?
Please, let's just go.

276
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,369
No, we can't,
those things are everywhere.

277
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,787
Oh, God.

278
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,623
Shh, shh, shh.

279
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,796
She's right about one thing.
We can't stay here.

280
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,340
We gotta get out,
to the roadhouse or somewhere.

281
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,051
- Let people know what's coming.
- That's a good point.

282
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,220
Night of the Living Dead
didn't end pretty.

283
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,640
I'm not sure we got a choice.
Folks up here are good with rifles.

284
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,309
Even with all your hardware,
we're easy targets.

285
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,311
So unless you got some explosives...

286
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,070
We could make some.

287
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,453
Hey! Let me in! Let me in, please!

288
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,331
It's Duane Tanner.

289
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,504
Oh, thank God.

290
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,636
Duane, you okay?

291
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,890
- That's the guy that I:
- Yeah.

292
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,684
Who else is in here?

293
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,686
Hey, whoa, whoa, easy there, chief.

294
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,148
Hey, doc, give Duane
a good once-over, would you?

295
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,193
Pam?

296
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,113
- Who are you?
- Never mind who I am.

297
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,699
- Doc?
- Yeah, okay.

298
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,034
Duane, where you been?

299
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,664
I was on a fishing trip up by Roslyn.
I came back this afternoon.

300
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,251
I saw Roger McGill being dragged out
of his house by people we know.

301
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,712
They started cutting him with knives.

302
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,214
I ran. I've been hiding in the woods
ever since.

303
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,300
Has anybody seen my mom and dad?

304
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,553
Awkward.

305
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,016
You're bleeding.

306
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,229
- Where'd you get that?
- I was running. I must've tripped.

307
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,232
Tie him up. There's rope there.

308
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,901
- Wait--
- Sit down!

309
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,988
Sorry, Duane. He's right.
We gotta be careful.

310
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,199
Careful? About what?

311
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,993
- Did they bleed on you?
- No. What the hell--? No!

312
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,996
Doc? Any way to know for sure?
Any test?

313
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:03,042
- I've studied Beverly's blood work.
- My mom?

314
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,753
It took three hours
for the virus to incubate.

315
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,422
The sulfur didn't appear
in the blood until then.

316
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,174
No, there'd be no way of knowing.

317
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,053
Not until after Duane turns.

318
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:17,598
Dean, I gotta talk to you. Now.

319
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,685
Sit in that chair over there.

320
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,774
This is my vision, Dean.

321
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,943
- It's happening.
- Yeah, I figured.

322
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,321
You can't kill him. Not yet.
We don't know if he's infected or not.

323
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,656
I think we're damn sure.

324
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:37,159
Guy shows up out of nowhere.
Got a cut, his whole family's infected.

325
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,411
We should keep him tied up
and wait and see.

326
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,164
For what? For him to hulk out?
Infect somebody else?

327
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,084
No, thanks, can't take that chance.

328
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,754
I'm not happy about this.
It's a tough job. You know that.

329
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,715
It's supposed to be tough.
We're supposed to struggle.

330
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,801
- That's the point.
- What does it buy us?

331
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:57,304
- A clear conscience, for one.
- Well, it's too late for that.

332
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,265
- What's happened to you?
- What?

333
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,101
You might kill an innocent man
and you don't even care.

334
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,936
You don't act
like yourself anymore.

335
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:07,273
You know what? You're acting like
one of those things out there.

336
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,986
Hey.

337
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,571
Hey.

338
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,032
Open the damn door. Dean.

339
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:21,328
Don't do it, Dean! Don't.

340
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,506
No, no, no. You're not gonna...

341
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,011
No, no, I swear, it's not in me.

342
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,846
Oh, God. We're all gonna die.

343
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,431
Maybe he's telling the truth.

344
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,058
- No, he's not him, not anymore.
Stop, stop it!

345
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,687
Ask her. Ask the doctor.
It's not in me!

346
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,192
I can't tell.

347
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,530
Please, don't.

348
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:01,744
Don't, please. I swear, it's not in me.
It's not in me, I swear.

349
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:05,831
I swear, it's not in me. Don't. Don't.

350
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,458
I got no choice.

351
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,461
No.

352
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,839
No.

353
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,738
Damn it.

354
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,933
It's been over four hours.

355
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:09,812
Duane's blood is still clean.
I don't think he's infected.

356
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,190
I'd like to untie him,
if that's all right.

357
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,200
Sure, yeah.

358
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,958
You know I'm gonna ask you why.

359
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,919
Yeah, I know.

360
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:38,382
So, why? Why didn't you do it?

361
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,429
We need more alcohol.

362
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,688
How you holding up, Pam?

363
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,231
Good.
Good.

364
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,442
It'll all be over soon.

365
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,660
In fact...

366
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,913
...I've been waiting
for this the whole time.

367
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,417
- For what?
- To get you alone.

368
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,617
She bled on him.

369
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,704
He's got the virus.

370
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,473
Doctor, check his wound again,
would you?

371
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,021
Doctor.

372
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,316
What does she need to examine him for?
You saw what happened.

373
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,693
Did her blood actually
enter your wound?

374
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,904
- Of course it did.
- We don't know for sure.

375
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,114
Can't take a chance.
You know what to do.

376
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,574
Nobody shoots my brother.

377
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,118
He won't be your brother
much longer. You said it.

378
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,412
- Nobody's shooting.
- You were gonna shoot me!

379
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,707
- You don't shut your pie hole, I might.
- Dean, they're right.

380
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,168
I'm infected.
Give me the gun and I'll do it.

381
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,671
- Forget it.
- I won't become one of those things.

382
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,714
- We've still got some time--
- For what?

383
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,635
I understand he's your brother,
I'm sorry. I gotta take care of this.

384
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,471
I'll say this once.
Make a move on him, you'll be dead.

385
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,266
You understand me?
I mean, do I make myself clear?

386
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,685
Dean.
- Then what are we supposed to do?

387
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,989
Get the hell out of here, that's what.

388
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,868
Take my car. You got the explosives.
There's an arsenal in there.

389
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,872
You two go with him. You got enough
firepower to handle anything now.

390
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,206
What about you?

391
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,338
Dean, no, no.

392
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:26,592
Go with them.
This is your only chance.

393
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:30,846
- Not gonna get rid of me that easy.
- No, he's right, man. Come with us.

394
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,063
Okay, it's your funeral.

395
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,616
I'm sorry.
Thanks for everything, marshals.

396
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,493
Oh, actually,
we're not really marshals.

397
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,914
Um... Oh.

398
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:21,188
Wish we had a deck of cards
or a foosball table or something.

399
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,776
Dean, don't do this.

400
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,529
Just get the hell out of here.

401
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,740
No way.

402
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,539
Give me my gun and leave.

403
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:44,544
For the last time, Sam, no.

404
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,261
This is the dumbest thing
you've ever done.

405
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:58,183
I don't know about that.
Remember that waitress in Tampa?

406
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,561
Dean, I'm sick.

407
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:07,275
It's over for me.
It doesn't have to be for you.

408
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,236
- No?
- No, you could keep going.

409
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,946
Who says I want to?

410
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,116
What?

411
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,503
I'm tired, Sam.

412
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,423
I'm tired of this job.

413
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,467
This life.

414
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,595
This weight on my shoulders.
Man, I'm tired of it.

415
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,098
So, what?
So you're just gonna give up?

416
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,267
I mean, you're just gonna
lay down and die?

417
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:44,604
- Dean, I know the stuff with Dad had--
- You're wrong.

418
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,859
It's not about Dad.

419
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,488
- I mean, part of it is, sure--
- Then what is it about?

420
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,549
You better come see this.

421
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:38,283
There's no one. Not anywhere.
They've all just vanished.

422
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:55,759
Well, it's been five hours
and your blood's still clean.

423
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,178
I don't understand it,
but you dodged a bullet.

424
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,097
But I was exposed.

425
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:04,184
- How could I not be infected?
- I don't know, but you're just not.

426
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:07,687
I mean, when you compare it
with the Tanners' samples...

427
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,314
What the hell?

428
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,274
What?

429
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,821
Their blood.
There's no trace of the virus.

430
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,782
No sulfur, nothing.

431
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,711
Doc, the sarge and I are getting
the hell out of here, heading south.

432
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,548
- You should come.
- I'd better get over to Sidewinder.

433
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:38,885
Get the authorities up here,
if they'll believe me.

434
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,971
Take care.

435
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,474
What about him?

436
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,436
He's gonna be fine.
No signs of infection.

437
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:05,078
Hey, man, don't look at me.
I got no clue.

438
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,581
I swear,
I'm gonna lose sleep over this one.

439
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,457
I mean, why here? Why now?

440
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:13,753
Where the hell did everybody go?
It's not like they just frigging melted.

441
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,380
And why was I immune?

442
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,592
Yeah. You know what?
That's a good question.

443
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:23,013
You know, I'm already starting to feel
like this is the one that got away.

444
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,087
Do you mind pulling over
up ahead there?

445
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,299
All right.

446
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,808
- I gotta make a call.
- No phone out here.

447
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,894
I got it covered.

448
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,812
What the hell is that?

449
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,176
It's over. You'll be pleased.

450
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,846
I don't think any more tests
are necessary.

451
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:52,936
The Winchester boy,
definitely immune, as expected.

452
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,731
Yes, of course.

453
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,400
Nothing left behind.

454
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,352
So... Last night.

455
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,355
You wanna tell me what the hell
you were talking about?

456
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,983
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

457
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,902
I mean, you said
you were tired of the job.

458
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,821
And that it wasn't because of Dad.

459
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,991
- Forget it.
- No, I can't. No way.

460
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,910
I thought we were gonna die.
You can't hold that over me.

461
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,079
No, you can't pull that crap
with me, man.

462
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,081
- You're talking.
- And what if I don't?

463
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:59,252
Then I guess I'll just
have to keep asking until you do.

464
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:10,180
I don't know, man.
I just think maybe we ought to...

465
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,518
...go to the Grand Canyon.

466
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,731
- What?
- Yeah, you know...

467
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,442
...all this driving back and forth
across country.

468
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,612
I've never been to the Grand Canyon.
Or we could go to TJ.

469
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,114
Or Hollywood,
see if we could bang Lindsay Lohan.

470
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,033
You're not making any sense.

471
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,537
I just think we should
take a break from all this.

472
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,956
Why do we gotta get stuck
with the responsibility?

473
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,875
Why can't we live life a little bit?

474
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,668
Why are you saying all this?

475
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:48,093
No, no, no, Dean.
You're my brother, all right?

476
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:52,222
So whatever weight you're carrying,
let me help a little bit.

477
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,604
I can't. I promised.

478
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,066
- Who?
- Dad.

479
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,612
What are you talking about?

480
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,991
Right before Dad died...

481
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,994
...he told me something.

482
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,957
He told me something about you.

483
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,254
What?

484
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,092
Dean, what did he tell you?
