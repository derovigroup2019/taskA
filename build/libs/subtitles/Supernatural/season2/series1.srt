2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,050
back in 1835,
Samuel Colt made a special gun.

3
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,200
they say this gun can kill anything.

4
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,500
the Colt is gone,
and it seems pretty damn likely

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,100
that the demon is behind all of this.

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
whoops.

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,100
crossroads are where pacts are made.

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,800
in selling your soul,
rituals like this,

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,500
you got to put your own photo
into the mix, right?

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,000
I know all about you,
Dean Winchester.

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,100
I'm looking for the best and brightest.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,500
-I'm Sam.
-I'm Jake.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,200
this is a competition.

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,300
only one of you crazy kids

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,000
is gonna make it out of here alive.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,100
unh!

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,900
you're tough, you're smart,
you're well-trained.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,650
Sam, you're my favorite.

19
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,300
-Sam!
-Dean!

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,600
Sam, look out!

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,100
unh!

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,300
no!

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,500
Sam!!

24
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:40,310
<font color="#ffff00">capture:frm@????

25
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,800
Dean?

26
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,400
brought you this back.

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
no, thanks.
I'm fine.

28
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,700
you should eat something.

29
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,300
I said I'm fine.

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,400
Dean...

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,500
I hate to bring this up.
I really do.

32
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,100
but don't you think
maybe it's time...

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,300
we bury Sam?

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,000
no.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,550
we could 
 maybe...

36
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
what -- torch his corpse?

37
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,500
not yet.

38
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,500
I want you to come with me.

39
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,500
I'm not going anywhere.

40
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,000
Dean, please.

41
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,700
won't you cut me some slack?

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,700
I just don't think you should be alone, 
that's all.

43
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,500
I got to admit --
I could use your help.

44
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,500
something big is going down --

45
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,100
end-of-the-world big.

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,450
well, then let it end!

47
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,600
you don't mean that.

48
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,400
you don't think so?

49
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,200
huh?

50
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,200
you don't think
I've given enough?

51
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,700
you don't think
I've paid enough?

52
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,400
I'm done with it.

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,900
all of it.

54
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
and if you know
what's good for you,

55
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,200
turn around
and get the hell out of here.

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,500
go!!

57
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,100
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,700
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,900
please just go.

60
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,500
you know where I'll be.

61
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,000
howdy, Jake.

62
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,100
I'm -- I'm dreaming,
aren't I?

63
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,700
I got a genius on my hands.

64
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,700
well,
congratulations, Jake.

65
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,700
you're it --
last man standing.

66
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,900
the american idol.

67
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,200
I have to admit --

68
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,400
you weren't the horse
I was betting on,

69
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,200
but still,
I got to give it to you.

70
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,700
go...
to hell.

71
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,800
been there, 
done that.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,600
everything you put me through --

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,600
dragging me to that place,

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,200
making me kill those people...

75
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,200
all part of the beauty pageant.

76
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,400
Jake, I needed the strongest,
and that's you.

77
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,000
needed me for what?

78
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,000
oh, I got a laundry list
of tasty things for you.

79
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,000
the only thing I'm gonna do

80
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,900
is wake up, hunt you down,

81
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,800
and kill you myself.

82
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,800
you know,
others have tried.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,200
it's not easy.

84
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,300
trust me, Jake. 
you want to be a good little soldier here.

85
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,800
and if I'm not?

86
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,100
if you're a bad little soldier,

87
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,300
well, that dear old mom of yours,

88
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
that adorable little sister...

89
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll make certain
that they both live long enough

90
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,300
to know the chewy taste

91
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
of their own intestines.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,300
no, Jake.

93
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,600
I'm not bluffing.

94
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,900
what do you want me to do?

95
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,600
like I said -- genius.

96
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,600
you know, when we were little --

97
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,200
you couldn't have been
more than 5 --

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,100
you just started asking questions.

99
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,700
how come we didn't have a mom?

100
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,100
why do we always have to move around?

101
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,300
where'd dad go

102
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,400
when he'd take off
for days at a time?

103
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,000
I remember I begged you --
"quit asking, Sammy.

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
man, you don't want to know."

105
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,000
I just wanted you to be a kid...

106
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,000
just for a little while longer.

107
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,900
I always tried to protect you...

108
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,600
...keep you safe.

109
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,100
dad didn't even have to tell me.

110
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,900
it was just always 
my responsibility, you know?

111
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,800
it's like I had <I>one</I> job...

112
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,900
I had <I>one</I> job...

113
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,500
and I screwed it up.

114
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,200
I blew it.

115
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,100
and for that, I'm sorry.

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,500
I guess that's what I do.

117
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,100
I let down the people I love.

118
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,600
I let dad down.

119
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,900
and now I guess I'm just
supposed to let you down, too.

120
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,800
how can I?

121
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,900
how am I supposed to live with that?

122
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,000
what am I supposed to do?

123
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,500
Sammy.

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,800
god.

125
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,700
what am I supposed to do?

126
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,300
what am I supposed to do?!

127
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,100
come on, already.

128
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,300
show your face, you bitch!

129
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,400
easy, sugar.
you'll wake the neighbors.

130
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,900
Dean.

131
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,500
it is so, <I>so</I> good
to see you.

132
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,900
I mean it.
look at you.

133
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,900
gone and got your family killed,
all alone in the world.

134
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,300
it's too sweet.

135
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,500
excuse me.
 you're gonna have to give me a moment.

136
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,900
sometimes you got to stop
and smell the roses.

137
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,400
I should send you
straight back to hell.

138
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,900
oh, you should.

139
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,500
but you won't.

140
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,300
and I know why.

141
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,200
-oh, yeah?
-yeah.

142
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,300
following in daddy's footsteps,
you want to make a deal.

143
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,800
little Sammy back from the dead,
and --

144
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
let me guess --
you're offering up your own soul?

145
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,900
there are a hundred other demons
who'd love to get their hands on it.

146
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,000
and it's all yours.

147
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,800
all you got to do
is bring Sam back.

148
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,300
give me 10 years --

149
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,300
10 years,
and then you come for me.

150
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,600
you must be joking.

151
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,100
that's the same deal.you give everybody else.

152
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,800
you're not everybody else.

153
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,300
why would I want to give you anything?

154
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,500
just keep your gutter soul.
it's too tarnished, anyways.

155
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,600
nine years.

156
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,400
no.

157
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,100
eight.

158
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,600
you keep going,
I'll keep saying no.

159
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,000
okay, five years.

160
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,300
five years,
and my bill comes due.

161
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,700
that's my last offer --
five years or no deal.

162
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,200
then no deal.

163
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,200
-fine.
-fine

164
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,800
make sure you bury Sam before
he starts stinking up the joint.

165
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,500
wait.

166
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,400
it's a fire sale,
and everything must go.

167
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
what do I have to do?

168
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,700
first of all,
quit groveling.

169
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,600
needy guys are such a turnoff.

170
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,400
look...

171
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,600
??I shouldn't be doing this.
I could get in a lot of trouble.

172
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,300
but what can I say?
I got a blind spot for you, Dean.

173
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
you're like a...puppy.
you're just too fun to play with.

174
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,300
I'll do it.

175
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,800
you'll bring him back?

176
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,900
I will.

177
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,500
and because I'm such a saint,

178
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,800
I'll give you one year
and one year only.

179
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
but here's the thing.

180
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,800
if you try and welch or weasel your way out,
then the deal is off.

181
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,700
Sam drops dead.
he's back to rotten meat in no time.

182
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,900
so...

183
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
??better deal
than your dad ever got.

184
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,900
what do you say?

185
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,400
Sammy.

186
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,300
thank god

187
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,200
hey.

188
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
ow.

189
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,700
uh, Dean...

190
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, man.

191
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,100
I'm just...

192
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,300
I'm just happy
 to see you up and around, that's all.

193
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,000
-come on. sit down.
-okay.

194
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,200
Dean...
what happened to me?

195
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,800
well,
what do you remember?

196
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,800
I-I saw you and Bobby,
and...

197
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,900
I felt this pain,
this sharp pain like...

198
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,800
like, white-hot,
you know, and...

199
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,100
then you started running
at me, and...

200
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
that's about it.

201
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,700
yeah, that -- 
that kid stabbed you in the back.

202
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,900
you lost a lot of blood.
it was touch and go for a while.

203
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,400
but, Dean, you -- 
you can't patch up a wound that bad.

204
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,500
no, Bobby could.

205
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,900
who was that kid,anyway?

206
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,500
his name's Jake.
did you get him?

207
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,200
no, he disappeared into the woods.

208
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,700
we got to find him, Dean.

209
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,300
and I swear I'm gonna 
tear that son of a bitch apart.

210
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
whoa, whoa, whoa.
easy, van damme.

211
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
you just woke up,all right?

212
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,800
let's get you something to eat.
you want something to eat?

213
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,300
I'm starving.
come on.

214
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,100
and that's when you guys showed up.

215
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,000
that's awful.

216
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,900
poor Andy.

217
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,200
the demon said he only wanted
one of us to walk out alive.

218
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,000
-he told you that?
-yep.

219
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,600
he appeared in a dream.

220
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,000
he tell you anything else?

221
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,600
no. no.

222
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,300
that was it.
nothing else.

223
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
you know,
what I don't get, Dean,

224
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,700
is if the demon
only wanted <I>one</I> of us,

225
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,500
then how did Jake and I both get away?

226
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,300
well, I mean,
they left you for dead.

227
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,800
I'm sure they thought it was over.

228
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,200
now that yellow eyes has Jake,
what's he gonna do with him?

229
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
I don't know.

230
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,100
but whatever it is,
we got to stop him.

231
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,100
hold on, all right?
you need to get your rest.

232
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,100
we got time.

233
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,100
no, we don't.

234
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,100
Sam,
oceans aren't boiling, okay?

235
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,600
frogs aren't raining from the sky.

236
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,500
let's get you your strength back first.

237
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,700
??did you call the Roadhouse?
do they know anything?

238
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,100
yeah.

239
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,900
Dean...what is it?

240
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
the Roadhouse burned to the ground.
ash is dead,probably Ellen --

241
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,400
a lot of other hunters, too.

242
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,200
demons?

243
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,400
yeah, we think so.

244
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,700
we think
because ash found something.

245
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,800
what'd he find?

246
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,800
Bobby's working on that right now.

247
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,400
well, come on, then.
Bobby's only a few hours away.

248
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,200
whoa, whoa, whoa. stop.
Sam, stop, damn it.

249
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,400
you almost died in there.
I mean, what would I have --

250
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,100
you just take care of yourself
for a little bit, huh?

251
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,300
just for a little bit.

252
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,200
I'm sorry.
 no.

253
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,000
-hey, Bobby.
-hey, Bobby.

254
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,400
see you up and around.

255
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,900
yeah, well...

256
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,100
thanks for patching me up.

257
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,100
don't mention it.

258
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,300
well, Sam's better.

259
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,500
and we're back in it now,
so...

260
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
what do you know?

261
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,000
well, I found something,but...

262
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
I'm not sure
what the hell it means.

263
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,000
what is it?

264
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,600
demonic omens...like a frickin' tidal wave.
cattle deaths,lightning storms.

265
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,400
they skyrocketed
from out of nowhere.

266
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,400
here.

267
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,800
all around here except for one place --

268
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,800
southern wyoming.

269
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,800
wyoming?

270
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,500
yeah.

271
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,200
that one area's totally clean -- 
spotless.

272
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,900
it's almost as if...

273
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,900
what?

274
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,100
...the demons are surrounding it.

275
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,700
but you don't know why?

276
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,300
no, and by this point,
my eyes are swimming.

277
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,600
Sam, would you take a look at it?

278
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,550
maybe you can catch something I couldn't.

279
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,700
yeah, sure.

280
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,800
come on, Dean.

281
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,200
I got some more books in the truck.

282
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,800
help me lug them in.

283
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,600
yeah.

284
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,700
you stupid ass!
what did you do?

285
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,000
what did you do?!

286
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,100
you made a deal...
for Sam, didn't you?

287
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,700
how long did they give you?

288
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,600
Bobby.

289
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,900
how long?!

290
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
one year.

291
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,600
damn it, Dean.

292
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,000
which is why we got to find
this yellow-eyed son of a bitch.

293
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,700
that's why I'm gonna kill him myself.
I got nothing to lose now,right?

294
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,200
I could throttle you!

295
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,400
and send me downstairsahead of schedule?

296
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,600
what is it with you Winchesters, huh?

297
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,200
you, your dad,

298
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,700
you're both just <I>itching</I> to
throw yourselves down the pit.

299
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,800
that's my point.

300
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,450
dad brought me back, Bobby.
I'm not even supposed to be here.

301
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,600
at least this way,something good
could come out of it, you know?

302
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,900
it's like my life can mean something.

303
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,400
what?
and it didn't before?

304
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,300
have you got that low an opinion of yourself?

305
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,200
are you that screwed in the head?!

306
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,900
I couldn't let him die,
Bobby.

307
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,500
I couldn't.

308
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,000
he's my brother.

309
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,900
how is your brother gonna feel 

310
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,300
when he knows you're going to hell?

311
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,100
how'd <I>you</I> feel 
when you knew your dad went for <I>you?</I>

312
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,800
you can't tell him.

313
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,400
you take a shot at me,
whatever you got to do,

314
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,800
but please don't tell him.

315
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,800
Ellen?

316
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,000
Ellen.
oh, god.

317
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,500
Bobby,
is this really necessary?

318
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,400
just a belt of holy water.
shouldn't hurt.

319
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
whiskey now,
if you don't mind.

320
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,900
Ellen, what happened?
how'd you get out?

321
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,200
I wasn't supposed to.

322
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,200
I was supposed to be in there
with everybody else.

323
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,600
but we ran out of pretzels,
of all things.

324
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,800
it was just dumb luck.

325
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,600
anyway, that's when ash called,
panic in his voice.

326
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,300
he told me to look in the safe.

327
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,700
then the call cut out.

328
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,200
by the time I got back,
the flames were sky-high,

329
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,300
and everybody was dead.

330
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,600
I could n't have been gone
more than 15 minutes.

331
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,300
sorry, Ellen.

332
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,700
a lot of good people died in there.

333
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,200
and <I>I</I> got to live.

334
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,900
lucky me.

335
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,800
Ellen,you mentioned a safe.

336
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,300
a hidden safe we keep in the basement.

337
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,000
demons get what was in it?

338
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,800
no.

339
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,600
wyoming.

340
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,000
what does that mean?

341
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,900
I don't believe it.

342
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
what?you got something?

343
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,300
a lot more than that.

344
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,600
each of these x's is
an abandoned frontier church --

345
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,600
all mid-19th century

346
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,500
and all of them built by Samuel Colt.

347
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Samuel Colt --the demon-killing,
gunmaking Samuel Colt?

348
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,900
yep.
and there's more.

349
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,600
he built private railway lines

350
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,800
connecting church to church.

351
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,200
it just happens to lay out like this.

352
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,400
tell me that's not
what I think it is.

353
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,900
it's a devil's trap.

354
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,200
a 100-square-mile devil's trap.

355
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,600
that's brilliant.
iron lines demons can't cross.

356
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,100
I never heard of anything that massive.

357
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
no one has.

358
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,200
??none of the lines are broken?
it still works?

359
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,200
definitely.

360
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,000
how do <I>you</I> know?

361
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,800
all those omens Bobby found.

362
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,000
??the demons, they must be circling
 and they can't get in.

363
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,500
yeah, well...
they're trying.

364
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,800
why? what's inside?

365
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,400
that's what
I've been looking for,

366
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,500
and, uh, there's nothing except 
an old cowboy cemetery right in the middle.

367
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,100
well, what's so important
about a cemetery or...

368
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,700
what's Colt trying to protect?

369
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,000
well, unless...

370
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,200
unless what?

371
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,100
what if Colt wasn't trying
to keep the demons out?

372
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,900
what if he was trying
to keep something <I>in?</I>

373
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,600
-that's a comforting thought.
-yeah, you think?

374
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,400
could they do it, Bobby?
could they get inside?

375
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
this thing's so powerful,

376
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,300
you'd practically need an a-bomb
to destroy it.

377
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
no way a full-blood demon
gets across.

378
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,800
no.

379
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,600
but I know who could.

380
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,500
howdy, Jake.

381
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,900
so, did you have a nice trip?

382
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm here.

383
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,100
I did what you asked.
now what?

384
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,100
50 miles thataway,
there's a cemetery, a crypt.

385
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,600
you got to open that for me.

386
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,500
think you can manage that,
sport?

387
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,800
you know what? screw you
 <I>and</I> your freaky orders.

388
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,800
go do it yourself.

389
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,800
oh, I can't.
I can't go that way -- not yet.

390
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,900
why not?

391
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,000
I just can't.

392
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,800
but if you're gonna open that crypt for me,
you're gonna need a key.

393
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,200
a gun?

394
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,600
oh, this isn't just any gun, Jake.

395
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,800
this is the only gun
in the whole universe

396
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,800
that can shoot me dead.

397
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,300
-is that so?
-yep.

398
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,900
here, take it.

399
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,700
oh, my.

400
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm shocked at this
 unforeseen turn of events.

401
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,800
go ahead, Jake.squeeze that trigger.
be all you can be.

402
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,200
this will all be over.
your life can go back to normal.

403
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,800
of course, the army won't take
you back 'cause you're awol.

404
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,400
but I'm sure you could get your
old job at the factory back.

405
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,700
but then,
on the other hand,

406
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,700
the rest of your life
and your family's

407
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,700
could be money and honey,
health and wealth,

408
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,000
every day
is ice-cream sundae.

409
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
and all you got to do
is this one little thing.

410
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,100
why me?

411
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,300
oh, Jake.
it's got to be you.

412
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,900
I've been waiting for you
for a very long time.

413
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,100
you're my leader.

414
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,900
you open that crypt,
and you will have your army.

415
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,700
you're talking
about the end of the world.

416
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,400
no, not the end --
the beginning...

417
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,600
a better world
where your family will be protected.

418
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,000
more than that.

419
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,200
they'll be royalty.

420
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,100
buddy boy,you have the chance 

421
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,100
to get in on the ground floor
of a thrilling opportunity.

422
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,300
what do you say?

423
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
it's your call.

424
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,900
attababy.

425
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
howdy, Jake.

426
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
wait...

427
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,700
-you were dead.I killed you.
-yeah?

428
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,900
well, next time,
finish the job.

429
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,100
I did.

430
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,300
I cut clean through
your spinal cord, man.

431
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,100
you can't be alive.

432
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,300
you can't be.

433
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,500
okay, just take it
real easy there, son.

434
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
and if I don't?

435
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,200
wait and see.

436
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,500
what, you a tough guy
all of a sudden?

437
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,800
what are <I>you</I> gonna do --
kill me?

438
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,900
it's a thought.

439
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
you had your chance.
you couldn't.

440
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,000
I won't make that mistake twice.

441
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,400
what are you smiling at,
you little bitch?

442
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,000
hey, lady.

443
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
do me a favor.

444
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,900
put that gun to your head.

445
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,700
see, that ava girl was right.

446
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,700
once you give in to it,

447
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,700
there's all sorts of new
jedi mind tricks you can learn.

448
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
let her go.

449
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,600
shoot him.

450
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,100
you'll be mopping up skull
before you get a shot off.

451
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,200
everybody,
put your guns down.

452
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,700
except you, sweetheart.

453
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,700
okay.

454
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,000
thank you.

455
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,400
please...don't.

456
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,100
please.

457
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,200
oh, no.

458
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,400
Bobby, what is it?

459
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,700
it's hell.

460
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,500
take cover -- now!

461
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,000
what the hell just happened?!

462
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,100
that's a devil's gate,
a damn door to hell!

463
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,000
come on!
we got to shut that gate!

464
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,600
if the demon gave this to Jake...

465
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,900
then maybe...

466
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,300
a boy shouldn't play with daddy's guns.

467
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,100
Dean!

468
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,300
I'll get to you in a minute, champ.

469
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm proud of you --
knew you had it in you.

470
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
sit a spell.

471
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,400
so, Dean...

472
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,400
I got to thank you.

473
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,300
you see, demons can't resurrect people 

474
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,700
unless a deal is made.

475
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,300
I know, red tape --
it'll make you nuts.

476
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,100
but thanks to you,
Sammy's back in rotation.

477
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,300
now, I wasn't counting on that,
but I'm glad.

478
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
I liked him better than Jake, anyhow.

479
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,100
tell me --

480
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,100
have you ever heard the expression

481
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,500
"if a deal sounds too good to be true, 
it probably is"?

482
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,500
you call that deal good?

483
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,200
it's a better shake
than your dad ever got.

484
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,500
and you never wondered why?

485
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,400
I'm surprised at you.

486
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,000
I mean...

487
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,600
you saw what your brother
just did to Jake, right?

488
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,000
that was pretty cold,wasn't it?

489
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
how certain are you

490
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,250
that what you brought back
is 100% pure Sam?

491
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,899
you of all people should know

492
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,800
that what's dead should <I>stay</I> dead.

493
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,600
anyway...

494
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,600
thanks a bunch.

495
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,300
I knew I kept you alive
for some reason.

496
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,200
until now, anyway.

497
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,000
I couldn't have done it

498
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,200
without your pathetic,
self-loathing,

499
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,400
self-destructive desire

500
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,800
to sacrifice yourself for your family.

501
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,200
well, check <I>that</I> off
the to-do list.

502
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,900
you did it.

503
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,600
I didn't do it alone.

504
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,000
do you think dad really...

505
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,700
do you think he really
climbed out of hell?

506
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,600
the door was open.

507
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,800
if anyone's stubborn enough to do it...

508
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,300
it would be him.

509
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,700
where do you think he is now?

510
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
I don't know.

511
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,400
I kind of can't believe it,
Dean.I mean...

512
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,600
our whole lives,everything...

513
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
has been prepping for this,
and now I...

514
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,300
I kind of don't know
what to say.

515
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:38,900
 <I>I</I> do.

516
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,900
that was for our mom...

517
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,700
you son of a bitch.

518
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,900
you know,
when Jake saw me...

519
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,000
it was like he saw a ghost.

520
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,400
I mean, hell,
you heard him, Dean.

521
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
he said he killed me.

522
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,900
I'm glad he was wrong.

523
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,700
I don't think he was,Dean.

524
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,000
what happened...
after I was stabbed?

525
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,800
-I already told you.
-not everything.

526
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,000
Sam, we just killed the demon.

527
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,800
can we celebrate for a minute?

528
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,300
did I die?

529
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,000
oh, come on.

530
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,100
did you sell your soul for me,
like dad did for you?

531
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,100
come on! 
no

532
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,400
tell me the truth.

533
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,600
Dean, tell me the truth.

534
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,600
Sam...

535
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,750
how long do you get?

536
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,700
one year.

537
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,400
I got one year.

538
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,000
you shouldn't have done that.

539
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,100
how could you do that?

540
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,300
don't get mad at me.

541
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,700
don't you do that.

542
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I had to.

543
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,700
I had to look out for you.

544
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,100
that's my job.

545
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,900
and what do you think
 <I>my</I> job is?

546
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,100
what?

547
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,700
you saved my life over and over.

548
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,600
I mean, you sacrifice everything for me.

549
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,400
don't you think
I'd do the same for you?

550
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,500
you're my big brother.

551
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,700
there's <I>nothing</I>
I wouldn't do for you.

552
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,300
and I don't care what it takes.
I'm gonna get you out of this.

553
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,100
guess I got to save <I>your</I> ass
for a change.

554
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,500
yeah.

555
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,800
well...

556
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,700
yellow-eyed demon might be dead,

557
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,800
but a lot more got through that gate.

558
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
how many, you think?

559
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,200
100, maybe 200.

560
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,500
it's an army.

561
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,500
he's unleashed an army.

562
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,100
hope to hell
you boys are ready.

563
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,400
'cause the war has just begun.

564
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,000
well, then...

565
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,000
we got work to do.

566
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,700
