641
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,880
storm's coming, and you boys...

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,980
you are smack in the middle of it.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,820
"THE ROAD SO FAR"

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,720
You know the truth about sammy and the other children.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,130
Andrew gallagh er.

6
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,020
Ava wilson.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,010
I didn't hurt anybody.

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:18,890
Not yet.

9
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,760
Max, your abilities started se ven months ago, right?

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,740
How'd you know that?

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,630
The same thing killed our mothers.

12
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:27,890
You and I were chosen.

13
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:28,750
For what?

14
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,940
I don't know.

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,470
I saw this guy die days before it happened.

16
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,260
You can make people do things, can't you?

17
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,580
You can tell them what to think.

18
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,660
Cherry ride.

19
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,370
Can I have it?

20
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,410
Sure, man.

21
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,100
You must be one of us.

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,570
Who?

23
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,590
The psychics.

24
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,330
Screw you, buddy, 'cause I'm a secretary from peoria, and I'm not part of anything.

25
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:58,060
This demon tells me they have soldiers to fight in this coming war -- psychics fighting on hell's side.

26
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,850
The yellow-eyed man tells me to do things -- awful things.

27
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,800
He told me he's got big plans.

28
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,980
Maybe this is his plan.

29
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,960
Maybe we're all supposed to be -- what, killers?

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,810
Give me a break.

31
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,000
No one's heard anything about ava.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,510
She's just -- into thin air, you know?

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,390
Sulfur.

34
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,070
Ava.

35
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,120
Demon's been here.

36
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,820
If something bad's coming, it's coming fast, and their side holds all the cards.

37
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,730
We can't run from this, and you can't protect me.

38
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,320
Damn it, sam, this whole thing is spinning out of control.

39
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,970
"NOW"

40
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,580
Hey, don't forget the extra onions this time, huh?

41
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,500
Dude, I'm the one who's gonna have to ride in the car with your extra onions.

42
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,580
Hey, see if they got any pie.

43
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,540
Bring me some pie!

44
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,930
Bring me some pie....

45
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,040
Sam?

46
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,130
Sam?

47
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,360
Sulfur.

48
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,190
Sam!

49
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,790
Sammy!

50
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,980
Sam!

51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,110
Sammy!

52
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,720
Sam!

00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,450
Andy?

59
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,440
Sam.

60
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,250
What are you doing here?

61
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:55,740
I don't know.

62
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,700
What am I doing here?

63
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,430
I don't know.

64
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,950
Where are we?

65
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,420
Andy, look, calm down.

66
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,590
I can't calm down.

67
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,040
I just woke up in freaking frontier land.

68
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,720
What's the last thing you remember?

69
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,170
Honestly, my fourth bong load.

70
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,420
It was weird.

71
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,460
All of a sudden, there was this really intense smell, like A...

72
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,000
like sulfur?

73
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,610
How did you know that?

74
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,460
Dean.

75
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,010
Your brother -- is he -- is he here?

76
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,420
I don't know where he is.

77
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,910
I don't know if he'S...

78
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,610
Hello?

79
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,890
No!

80
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,240
Help me!

81
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,530
Okay, okay, I'm here.

82
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,000
We're gonna get you out, all right?

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,420
Just hold on a second.

84
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,250
All right, one second.

85
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,000
Ava?

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,370
Oh, my god!

87
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,380
Sam!

88
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,880
Hey.

89
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,590
So, I guess you guys know each other.

90
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah.

91
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,650
How did you -- I mean, how did  -- ava, have you been here this whole time?

92
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,590
What whole time?

93
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,830
I just woke up in there a half an hour ago.

94
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,150
Well, you've been gone for five months.

95
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,460
My brother and I have been looking for you everywhere.

96
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,040
That's impossible 'cause I saw you two days ago.

97
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,760
You didn'T.

98
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,960
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,810
But that makes no sense.

100
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,000
It'S...

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,760
not...

102
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,210
oh, my god!

103
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,110
My fianc?

104
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,270
brady.If I've been missing for that long, he must be freaking out!

105
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,550
Well...

106
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,690
Hey!

107
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,680
Andy -- also freaking out.

108
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,440
Okay.

109
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,360
What's happening?

110
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,580
Well, I, uh...

111
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't really know yet, but I know one thing.

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,030
I know what the three of us have in common.

113
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,240
Hello?

114
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,680
Anybody there?

115
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,200
Maybe more than three.

116
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,240
Wait.

117
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,170
Hello?

118
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,180
Hey, you guys all right?

119
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,600
Think so.

120
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,730
I'm sam.

121
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,950
I'm jake.

122
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,960
Lily.

123
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,240
Are there any more of you?

124
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,130
No.

125
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,300
How did we even get here?

126
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,900
A minute ago, I was in san diego.

127
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,580
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I went to sleep last night in afghanistan.

128
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,610
Let me take a wild guess.

129
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,550
You two are both 23?

130
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,270
We all are, and we all have abilities.

131
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,010
What?

132
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,960
It started a little over a year ago.

133
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,010
You find you can do things you didn't think were possible.

134
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,320
I have visions.

135
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,780
I see things before they happen.

136
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,820
Yeah, me too.

137
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,190
And I can put thoughts into people's heads -- like, make them do stuff.

138
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,780
Oh, but don't worry.

139
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,630
I don't think it works on you guys.

140
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,390
Oh, but get this -- um, I've been practicing, training my brain, like meditation, right?

141
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:58,190
So now it's not just thoughts that I can beam out, but images, too -- like, anything I want.

142
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,940
It's like bam!

143
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,090
People, they see it.

144
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,780
This one guy I know -- total dick -- I used it on him.

145
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,860
Gay porn all hours of the day.

146
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,410
It's just like...

147
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,720
you should have seen the look on his face.

148
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,340
You go, "simon says give me your wallet,and they do?

149
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,640
You have visions?

150
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,630
That's great.

151
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,150
I'd kill for something like that.

152
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,660
Lily, listen, it's okay.

153
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,850
No, it's not.

154
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,520
I touch people.

155
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,640
Their hearts stop.

156
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,970
I can barely leave my house.

157
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,250
My life's not exactly improved.

158
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,200
So screw you.

159
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,290
I just want to go home.

160
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,380
And we don't?

161
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,180
Don't -- hey, guys, come on.

162
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,390
Look, whether we like it or not, we're all here, and so we all have to deal with this.

163
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,330
Who brought us here?

164
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,120
It's less of a "who." 

165
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,010
It's more of a "what." 

166
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,600
What does that mean?

167
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,700
It's, uh...

168
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,710
it's a demon.

169
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,560
This is it -- all demonic signs and omens over the past month.

170
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,130
Are you joking?

171
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,130
There's nothing here.

172
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,390
Exactly.

173
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,800
Come on, there's got to be something.

174
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,360
What about the normal, low-level stuff -- you know, exorcisms, that kind of thing?

175
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,460
*************There's nothing.

176
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,560
It's completely quiet.

177
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,390
How are we supposed to look for sam, close our eyes and point?

178
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,570
Ash, what do you got?

179
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,590
Okay, listen.

180
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,650
It's a bit negatory on sam.

181
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,370
Come on, man.

182
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,200
You got to give us something.

183
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,560
We're looking at a 3,000-mile haystack here.

184
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,670
Listen, dean.

185
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,490
I did find something.

186
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,730
Well, what?

187
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,210
I can't talk over this line, dean.

188
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,780
Come on, I don't have time for this.

189
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,040
Make time, okay?

190
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,210
'Cause this...

191
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,330
what's up?

192
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,770
What's going on?

193
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,500
Not only does this almost definitely help you find your brother, this is...

194
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,150
It's huge.

195
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,700
So get here now.

196
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,640
I guess we're going to the roadhouse.

197
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,060
Come on.

198
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,390
So, we're soldiers in a demon war to bring on the apocalypse?

199
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,480
When you put it like that -- and we've been picked?

200
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:24,960
Yes.

201
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,720
Why us?

202
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,790
I'm not sure, okay?

203
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,930
But look, I just know -- sam.

204
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:29,900
I'm sorry.

205
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,390
Psychics and spoon-bending is one thing, but demons?

206
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,640
It sounds crazy.

207
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,650
It doesn't just sound it.

208
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,250
I don't care what you think.

209
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,050
If we're gathered here together, that means it's starting.

210
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,450
The only thing I got to do is stay away from wackjobs, okay?

211
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,670
I've heard enough.

212
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,940
I'm better off on my own.

213
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,050
Fyi -- so are you.

214
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,360
Jake, hold on.

215
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,010
Jake!

216
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,790
Hello?

217
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,530
It's all right.

218
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,940
Don't be scared.

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,530
Are you lost?

220
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,620
Hello?

221
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,320
"i will not kill"

222
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,640
Get back!

223
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,920
Just so you know...

224
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,630
that was a demon.

225
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,750
And that thing?

226
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,700
I'm not sure, but I think it was an achiri -- a demon that disguises itself as a little girl.

227
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,870
Still doesn't tell us where we are.

228
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,370
Andy, you with me or what?

229
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,290
Give me a minute.

230
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,660
I'm still working through "demons are real." 

231
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,360
I've seen that bell before.

232
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,960
I think I know where we are now -- cold oak, south dakota.

233
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,030
The town's so haunted, every single resident fled.

234
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,390
Swell.

235
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,260
Good to know we're somewhere so historical.

236
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,390
Why in the world would that demon or whatever put us here?

237
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,010
I'm wondering the same thing.

238
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,110
You know what?

239
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,190
It doesn't matter.

240
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,970
The only sane thing to do here is get the hell out of dodge.

241
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:07,660
Wait, hold on.

242
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,870
Lily, the only way out is through miles of woods.

243
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,620
Beats hanging out with demons.

244
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,810
Lily, we don't know what's going on yet.

245
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,290
We don't even know how many of them are out there.

246
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:16,990
Yeah, he's right.

247
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,020
We should -- don't say "we." 

248
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,210
I'm not part of "we." 

249
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,270
I have nothing in common with any of you.

250
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,070
Okay, look.

251
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,000
I know -- you don't know anything.

252
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:31,530
I to-- I accidentally touched my girlfriend.

253
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,920
I'm sorry.

254
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,330
Whatever.

255
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,340
I feel like I'm in a nightmare, and it just keeps getting worse and worse.

256
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,710
I've lost people, too.

257
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,370
I have a brother out there right now.

258
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,500
He could be dead, for all I know.

259
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,970
We're all in bad shape, but I'm telling you, the best way out of this is to stick together.

260
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,590
Fine.

261
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,700
We're looking for iron, silver, salt -- any kind of weapon.

262
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,020
Salt is a weapon?

263
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,320
It's a brave, new world.

264
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,030
Hopefully, there's food in your world, 'cause I'm freaking starving.

265
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,750
What the hell?

266
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,920
My god.

267
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,620
You see ellen?

268
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,560
No.

269
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,930
No ash, either.

270
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,890
Oh, ash, damn it!

271
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,370
Hey, you all right?

272
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,350
Yeah, I'm just...

273
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,770
I don't know -- a little dizzy.

274
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,920
A-are you sure it's not some kind -- what, some kind of freaky vision thing?

275
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,440
No, more like I'd just kill for a sandwich.

276
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,760
I haven't eaten since...

277
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,890
well, who knows.

278
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,240
No, it's -- don't worry, I'm fine, except for every single thing that's happening.

279
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,120
You guys, I found something!

280
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,200
Salt.

281
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,080
That's great, andy.

282
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,200
Now we all can s-- Where's lily?

283
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,610
Lily?

284
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,750
Lily!

285
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,910
Oh, my god!

286
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,580
Okay, that -- that's officially just...

287
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,930
sam, she's dead!

288
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,290
She's dead!

289
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,170
You said we were chosen for a reason.

290
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,530
That is not chosen.

291
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,490
That'S...

292
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,730
killed.

293
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,140
Okay, you know, we have to get out of here.

294
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,670
I second that emotion.

295
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,120
Not sure that's an option.

296
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,790
Lily was trying to leave.

297
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,310
The demon's not gonna let us get away that easy.

298
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,040
We got to gear up for the next attack.

299
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,880
Oh, gear up?

300
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,980
Yeah.

301
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,820
Okay, well, I'm not a soldier.

302
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,900
I can't do that!

303
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,470
Look, if you want to stay alive, you're gonna have to.

304
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,290
Let's go.

305
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,630
Oh, okay.

306
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,990
I'll get her down.

307
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,670
You know...

308
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,210
I was just thinking about how much dean would help right now.

309
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,490
I'd give my arm for a working phone.

310
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,860
You know, you may not need one.

311
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,460
I, uh, I mean, I've never tried it long-distance before.

312
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,730
Do you have anything of dean's on you, like something he touched?

313
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,110
I got a receipt.

314
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:56,680
Will that work?

315
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,210
Yeah.

316
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,040
D.Hasselhoff?

317
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,940
Yeah, that's dean's signature.

318
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,200
It...

319
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,520
it's hard to explain.

320
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,510
All right.

321
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,170
This is...

322
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,680
what the hell did ash know?

323
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,900
We got no way of knowing where ellen is or if she's even alive.

324
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,450
We got no clue what ash was gonna tell us.

325
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,200
Now, how the hell are we gonna find sam?

326
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,590
We'll find him.

327
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,160
Dean?

328
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,360
No!

329
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
What was that?

330
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,550
I don't know.

331
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,720
Headache?

332
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,500
You get headaches like that a lot?

333
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,310
No.

334
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,540
No.

335
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,680
It must be the stress.

336
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,420
I could have swore I saw something.

337
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,380
What do you mean?

338
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,420
Like -- like a vision?

339
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,450
Like what sam gets?

340
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,100
What?

341
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,740
No.

342
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,560
I'm just saying.

343
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,170
Come on, I'm not some psychic.

344
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,570
Oh, god!

345
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,590
Dean?!

346
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,940
Dean?

347
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,610
Are you with me?

348
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,860
Yeah, I think so.

349
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,670
I saw sam.

350
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,490
I saw him, bobby.

351
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:24,730
It was a vision.

352
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,910
Yeah.

353
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,100
I don't know how, but -- but yeah.

354
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,500
Whew!

355
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,420
That was about as fun as getting kicked in the jewels.

356
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,750
What else did you see?

357
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,980
Uh, there was a bell.

358
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,320
What kind of bell?

359
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,840
Um, like, a big -- a big bell with some kind of engraving on it.

360
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,580
I don't know.

361
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,270
Engraving?

362
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,260
Yeah.

363
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,770
Was it a tree -- like, an oak tree?

364
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,690
Yeah, exactly.

365
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,440
I know where sam is.

366
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,780
I-I'm not superman or anything.

367
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,130
It's no big deal.

368
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,060
You were in afghanistan when this started?

369
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:25,710
I started getting headaches, then, uh, there was this accident.

370
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:30,870
This guy flipped his vehicle on a bad road, got pinned underneath.

371
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,820
I lifted it off him like it was nothing.

372
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,710
E-everybody said it was a fluke adrenaline thing.

373
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,980
But then you did it again, right?

374
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,840
Bench-press 800 pounds, stone-cold calm.

375
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,620
I never told anybody, of course.

376
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,340
It's just too crazy.

377
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,770
Yeah, well, crazy's relative.

378
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,530
I'm starting to get that.

379
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,640
Yeah.

380
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,160
By the way, I, uh, appreciate what you're doing.

381
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,040
What am I doing?

382
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:04,830
Keeping calm, keeping them calm, especially considering how freaked to hell you really are.

383
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,900
I've been in some deep crap before myself.

384
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,110
I know the look.

385
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,410
Want to know the truth?

386
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,970
I got this brother, right?

387
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:27,520
And he's always telling me how he's gonna watch out for me, how everything's gonna be okay, like I've been telling them.

388
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,620
Yeah.

389
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,310
I don't know if I believe it this time.

390
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,470
I mean, the size of what's coming -- it's bigger than anyone's ever seen.

391
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:44,050
I mean, it's gonna get bad, and I-I don't know if -- if we're gonna make it.

392
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,800
It doesn't matter if we believe it.

393
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,280
Only matters that they do.

394
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,820
My horoscope said I shouldn't have gotten out of bed.

395
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,210
How you doing?

396
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,420
Holding up?

397
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,580
I'm okay.

398
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,850
What about you?

399
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,720
Not so okay.

400
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,840
Why us, sam?

401
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,370
What did we do to deserve this?

402
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,980
Just lucky, I guess.

403
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,500
If it wasn't for bad luck, wouldn't have no luck at all.

404
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,960
Just can't wait for this all to be over so I can just pretend it never happened.

405
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:56,650
Just want to curl up with brady and watch bad tv.

406
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,690
What is it?

407
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,320
Sam, do you......

408
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,920
know something that I don't?

409
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,210
Look, ava.

410
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,310
I'm sorry.

411
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,750
I wish I didn't have to tell you this.

412
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,930
Tell me what?

413
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,980
When the demon broke in to your house to take you, 

414
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,240
your fianc?didn't make it.

415
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,300
I'm sorry.

416
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,680
No, it'S...

417
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,800
Jake, behind you!

418
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,250
Howdy, sam.

419
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,070
I'm dreaming.

420
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:24,820
What do you say you and i take a little walk?

421
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,300
you're awfully quiet, sam.

422
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,730
You're not mad at me, are you?

423
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,900
I'm gonna tear you to shreds, I swear.

424
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,910
When you wake up, tiger, you give it your best shot.

425
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,550
Where's my brother?

426
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,140
Quit worrying about dean.

427
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,030
I'd worry more about yourself.

428
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,590
What, you gonna kill me?

429
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,920
I'm trying to help you.

430
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,100
That's why we're talking.

431
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,000
You're the one I'm rooting for.

432
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,640
What's that supposed to mean?

433
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,840
Welcome to the miss america pageant.

434
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,590
Why do you think you're here?

435
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,310
This is a competition.

436
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:14,010
Only one of you crazy kids is gonna make it out of here alive.

437
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,580
I thought we were supposed to be -- soldiers in a coming war?

438
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,230
That's true.

439
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:17,920
You are.

440
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,040
But here's the thing.

441
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,200
I don't need soldiers.

442
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,610
I need soldier.

443
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,300
I just need the one.

444
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:31,400
Why?

445
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,860
I couldn't just come out and say that, could I, sam?

446
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,250
I had to let everyone think they had a fighting chance.

447
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,950
But what I need...

448
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,070
is a leader.

449
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,870
To lead who?

450
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,510
Oh, I've already got my army -- or I will soon, anyway.

451
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,870
You son of a bitch.

452
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:54,410
Honestly, I'm surprised you hadn't guessed.

453
00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:01,210
I mean, why do you think so many children flamed out already -- max miller and andy's brother -- what's his name?

454
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,320
They weren't strong enough.

455
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:11,190
I'm looking for the best and brightest of your generation.

456
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,980
My generation?

457
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,440
Well, there's other generations, but let's just worry about yours.

458
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,130
That's why I'm here, sam.

459
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,670
I want to give you the inside track.

460
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:27,020
You're tough, you're smart, you're well-trained, thanks to your daddy.

461
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,300
Sam.

462
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,900
Sammy...

463
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,420
you're my favorite.

464
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,860
You ruined my life.

465
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,410
You killed everyone I love.

466
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,220
The cost of doing business, I'm afraid.

467
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,450
I mean, sweet, little jessica...

468
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,460
she just had to die.

469
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:54,800
You were all set to marry that little, blond thing, 
become a tax lawyer with two kids, 

470
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,030
a beer gut, and a little Mcmansion in the suburbs.

471
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:03,440
I needed you sharp, on the road, holding your skills -- your gifts.

472
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,220
What about my mom?

473
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,590
That was bad luck.

474
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,580
Bad luck.

475
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:12,670
She walked in on us -- wrong place, wrong time.

476
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,020
What does that mean?

477
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,450
It wasn't about her.

478
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,940
It was about you.

479
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,440
It's always been about you.

480
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,290
What?

481
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,390
Well...

482
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:33,460
okay, you caught me in a charitable mood.

483
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,700
I'll show you.

484
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,770
Look familiar?

485
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,050
It should.

486
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,740
Relax, sam.

487
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,460
This is just a high-def instant replay.

488
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,170
Enjoy the show.

489
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,770
John.

490
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,580
Mom.

491
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,920
Is he hungry?

492
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,180
Shh.

493
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,800
Okay.

494
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,910
Wait, mom.

495
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,120
Mom!

496
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,390
What did I just tell you, sam?

497
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,670
She can't hear you.

498
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,720
This isn't real.

499
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,860
What the hell are you doing to me?

500
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,700
Better than mother's milk.

501
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,300
Does this mean I have...

502
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,700
demon blood in me?

503
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,760
Answer me!

504
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,950
It's you.

505
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,190
She knew you.

506
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,750
No.

507
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,010
No!

508
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,090
I don't think you want to see the rest of this.

509
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,300
Sam, wake up.

510
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,370
Ava's missing.

511
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,950
I'll take the barn and the hotel.

512
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,210
You take the houses.

513
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:05,860
All right.

514
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,630
Meet back here in 10 minutes, okay?

515
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,190
Ava, where'd you go?

516
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,490
Didn't you hear us yelling?

517
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,120
Yeah, I heard you.

518
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,570
What are you doing?

519
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,490
Holy...

520
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,660
Sam, I just found him like this!

521
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,830
What happened?

522
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,210
I don't know.

523
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,720
How did that thing get in?

524
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,920
Where were you?

525
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,330
I just went to get some water from the well.

526
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,290
I was only gone, maybe, like, two minutes.

527
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,400
You shouldn't have gone outside.

528
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,260
Ava, we have to stay in here.

529
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:01,900
Who did that?

530
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,310
I don't know.

531
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,430
Maybe andy -- andy wouldn't do that.

532
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,080
Ava, that line wasn't broken when I left.

533
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:12,300
Ava.

534
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:12,910
What?

535
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,740
You don't think -- I'll tell you what I think.

536
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,020
Five months.

537
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,950
You're the only one with all that time you can't account for.

538
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,320
And that headache you got...

539
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,590
right when the demon got lily.

540
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,880
What are you trying to say?

541
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,860
What happened to you?

542
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,000
Nothing!

543
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,820
Had you going, though, didn't I?

544
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,390
Yeah.

545
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,930
I've been here a long time, and not alone, either.

546
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:53,110
People just keep showing up -- children, like us.

547
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,900
Batches of three or four at a time.

548
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,050
You killed them -- all of them?

549
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,900
I'm the undefeated heavyweight champ.

550
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,230
Oh, my god.

551
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,830
I don't think god has much to do with this, sam.

552
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,850
How could you?

553
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:13,240
I had no choice.

554
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,780
It's me or them.

555
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,470
After a while, it was easy.

556
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,090
It was even kind of fun.

557
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,010
I just stopped fighting it.

558
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,150
Fighting what?

559
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,820
Who we are, sam.

560
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:30,650
If you'd just quit your hand-wringing and open yourself up, you have no idea what you can do.

561
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,860
The learning curve is so fast.

562
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,240
It's crazy, the switches that just flip in your brain.

563
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:40,850
I can't believe I started out just having dreams.

564
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,740
Do you know what I can do now?

565
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,860
Control demons.

566
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,110
Ah.

567
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,620
You are quick on the draw.

568
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,370
Yeah, I'm sorry, sam, but...

569
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,630
it's over.

570
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,760
It looks like the rest of the way's on foot.

571
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,390
Let's go.

572
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,430
I think we can make it out of here now.

573
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,610
But the achiri demon.

574
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,420
No, no, no, ava was summoning it, controlling it.

575
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,140
It shouldn't come back now that she's dead.

576
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,240
We got to go.

577
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,150
No.Not "we," sam.

578
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,420
Only one of us is getting out of here.

579
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,200
I'm sorry.

580
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,940
What?

581
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,760
I had a vision.

582
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,360
That yellow-eyed demon, or whatever it was, he talked to me.

583
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,340
He told me how it was.

584
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,020
No, jake, listen.

585
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,020
You can't listen to him.

586
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,210
Sam, he's not letting us go.

587
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,210
Only one.

588
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,690
Now, we don't play along, he'll kill us both.

589
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,210
Now, I-I like you, man.

590
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,960
I do, but do the math, here.

591
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,050
What good's it do for both of us to die?

592
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:17,820
Now, I can get out of here, I get close to the demon, I can kill the bastard.

593
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,390
Come with me.

594
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,480
We can kill him together.

595
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,200
How do I know you won't turn on me?

596
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,240
I won't.

597
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,520
I don't know that.

598
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,660
Okay, look.

599
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,170
Just come with me, jake.

600
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,760
Don't do this.

601
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,690
Don't play into what it wants.

602
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,220
Okay.

603
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,800
Sam!

604
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,830
Sam!

605
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,950
Dean.

606
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,110
Sam, look out!

607
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,430
No!

608
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:58,830
No.

609
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,900
Sam.

610
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,540
Whoa, sam.

611
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,060
Sam.

612
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,330
Sam, hey.

613
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,750
Hey, come here.

614
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,250
Let me look at you.

615
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,550
Hey, look.

616
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,120
Look at me.

617
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,220
It's not even that bad.

618
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,010
It's not even that bad, all right?

619
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:16,650
Sammy?

620
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,930
Sam!

621
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,080
Hey, listen to me.

622
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,570
We're gonna patch you up, okay?

623
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,120
You'll be good as new.

624
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,160
Huh?

625
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,770
I'm gonna take care of you.

626
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:25,760
I got you.

627
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,430
That's my job, right?

628
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,030
Watch out for my pain-in-the-ass little brother.

629
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:31,460
Sam?

630
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,260
Sam.

631
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,800
Sam!

632
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,080
Sammy!

633
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,320
No.

634
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,940
No, no, no.

635
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,310
Oh, god.

636
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,910
Oh, god.

637
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,330
Sam!
