1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,169
Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off...

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:07,089
...saving people, hunting things,
the family business.

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,678
Still running credit-card scams?
- Think credit card fraud's easy?

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,179
Okay, Mr. Burkowitz.

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,098
- Federal marshals.
- Environmental majors.

6
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,933
Father Simmons.
U.S. Wildlife Service.

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,727
- Nigel Toughnell.
- Dr. Jerry Kaplan.

8
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,103
- Reporters.
- Art dealers.

9
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,063
- Students.
Homeland Security.

10
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,606
Pretty illegal, even for us.

11
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,443
SWAT team discovered
a local woman bound and gagged.

12
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,363
Her attacker, a white male,
approximately 24 to 30 years of age...

13
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,282
...was discovered hiding
in the home.

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,118
- Shapeshifter?
- Every culture has a shapeshifter lore.

15
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,955
Legends of creatures who can transform
themselves into animals or other men.

16
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,958
Hey.

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,588
Cops are blaming
this Dean Winchester guy...

18
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,797
...for Emily's murder.

19
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,466
- Sorry I'm gonna miss it.
- What?

20
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,968
How many chances will I have
to see my own funeral?

21
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,940
Under what name?

22
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,444
Oh, yeah, that's my favorite so far.

23
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:14,073
Possible IDs in three states
that we know of.

24
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,118
I gotta call you back.

25
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,252
Well...

26
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,341
...first I thought you were
just stepping up your game.

27
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,259
Credit card fraud...

28
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,888
...breaking and entering.
Now, this one puzzled me.

29
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,474
Grave desecration.

30
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,269
But still, these are
a long way from murder.

31
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,398
Then we get a fax from St. Louis.

32
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:53,779
Where you're suspected of torturing
and murdering a young woman.

33
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,490
However, no one could prove
anything, of course...

34
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,159
...because, supposedly, you died there.

35
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,456
Hands where I can see them.
- But I gotta tell you something.

36
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,543
You look pretty healthy to me.

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,424
So now we know Karen Giles
wasn't the first person you murdered.

38
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,677
Going somewhere, Sam?

39
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,723
But I guarantee you, she's the last.

40
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,582
Thought you might be thirsty.

41
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,042
Okay, so you're the good cop.

42
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,753
- Where's the bad cop?
- He's with your brother.

43
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,922
Okay. And you're holding us why?

44
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,924
He's being held
on suspicion of murder.

45
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,927
- And you? We'll see.
- Murder?

46
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:03,974
You sound genuinely surprised.
Or are you that good of an actor?

47
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,602
- Who's he supposed to have murdered?
- We'll get to that.

48
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,812
You can't just hold us here
without charges.

49
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,814
Well, actually, we can for 48 hours.

50
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,276
But you, being a pre-law student,
would know that.

51
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,612
I know all about you, Sam.

52
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,783
You're 23 years old, no job,
no home address.

53
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,369
Your mother died
when you were a baby.

54
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,206
Your father's whereabouts
are unknown.

55
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,876
And then there's the case
of your brother, Dean.

56
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,795
Whose demise was, well,
just a little bit exaggerated.

57
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,465
Feel free to jump in
whenever you like.

58
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,511
Shy? No problem, I'll keep going.

59
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,139
Your family moved around a lot
when you were a kid.

60
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,975
Despite that, you were
a straight-A student.

61
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,520
Got into Stanford with a full ride.

62
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,734
Then, about a year ago,
there was a fire in your apartment.

63
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,821
One fatality, Jessica Moore,
your girlfriend.

64
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,658
After she died, you fell off the grid.

65
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,660
Left behind everything.

66
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,204
I needed some time off.

67
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,915
To deal.

68
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,709
So I'm taking a road trip
with my brother.

69
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,544
How's that going for you?

70
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,338
Great.

71
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,340
I mean...

72
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,844
...we saw the second largest
ball of twine in the continental U.S.

73
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,388
Awesome.

74
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,600
We ran Dean's fingerprints
through AFIS.

75
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,062
- Okay.
- Got over a dozen possible hits.

76
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,856
Possible hits.
Which makes them worthless.

77
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,777
But makes you wonder. What are we
gonna find when we run your prints?

78
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:44,199
Yeah. Well, you be sure
to let me know, all right?

79
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,367
May I?

80
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,577
- Please.
- Great.

81
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,085
Sam, you seem like a good kid.

82
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,462
It's not your fault
Dean's your brother.

83
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,715
We can't pick our family.

84
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,260
Right now, detectives in St. Louis
are exhuming a corpse.

85
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,763
They're trying to figure out
how your brother faked his own death...

86
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,391
...after torturing
all those young women.

87
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,059
Dean's a bad guy.

88
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,228
His life is over.

89
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,730
Yours doesn't have to be.

90
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,484
You want me to turn against
my own brother?

91
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,946
No. We already caught him cold.

92
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,616
Red-handed at the Karen Giles
murder scene.

93
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:32,414
We just need you to fill in
some missing pieces.

94
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,124
Why would I do that?

95
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,838
Because I can talk to the DA.

96
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,132
Make a deal for you.

97
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,259
You can get on with your life.

98
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,802
Dean's as good as gone.

99
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,520
My dad and Tony Giles
were old friends.

100
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,774
They were in the service together.

101
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,319
We've known him
since we were kids, you know.

102
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,613
We came when we heard
about his death.

103
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,287
There you go.

104
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,956
- Anthony Giles.
- Who's Anthony Giles?

105
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,958
A Baltimore lawyer.

106
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,503
Working late at his office.
Check it out.

107
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,838
Ah...

108
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,550
His throat was slit,
but the room was clean.

109
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,136
- No DNA, no prints.
- Keep reading. It gets better.

110
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,474
"Security cameras failed to capture
footage of the assailant."

111
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:36,353
- Somebody tampered with the tapes--
- Or it's an invisible killer.

112
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,687
My favorite kind.

113
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:41,191
- What you think, Scully? Check it out?
- I'm not Scully. You're Scully.

114
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,403
No, I'm Mulder.
You're a redheaded woman.

115
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,155
So...

116
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,491
...would've been hard for Dean
to kill Tony...

117
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,702
- ...considering we weren't in town.
- Tell me what happened next.

118
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,665
Okay, that's when we went
to see Karen.

119
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,167
She was barely holding it together.

120
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,503
We just wanted to be there for her,
you know.

121
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,882
Insurance.

122
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,344
I totally forgot about the insurance.

123
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,180
We're very sorry to bother you
right now...

124
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,934
...but the company is required
to conduct its own investigation.

125
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,227
- You understand?
- Sure.

126
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,439
Okay. If you could just
tell us anything...

127
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,275
...you remember about the night
your husband died.

128
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,360
Tony and I were supposed
to have dinner.

129
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,280
He called and said that
he was having computer troubles...

130
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,823
...and he had to work late.

131
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,577
That was it.

132
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,371
You have any idea
who could have done this?

133
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:42,544
No. No. It's like I told the police,
I have no idea.

134
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,047
Did Tony mention anything unusual...

135
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,216
...to you in the days
before his death?

136
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,844
Unusual?

137
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,929
Yeah, like strange.

138
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,100
- Strange?
- You know, Karen, weird.

139
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,102
Weird noises...

140
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,229
...visions, anything like that?

141
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,565
- Ahem.
- What?

142
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,906
He had a nightmare
the day before he died, but--

143
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,408
What kind of a nightmare?

144
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,412
He said that he woke up
in the middle of the night.

145
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,915
There was a woman
standing at the foot of the bed.

146
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:23,251
He blinked, she was gone.
I mean, it was just a nightmare.

147
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,755
Did he say what she looked like?

148
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,259
What the hell difference does it
make what she looked like?

149
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,599
It's just our company's
very thorough.

150
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,811
He said she was pale
and she had dark red eyes.

151
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,023
So I gave Karen a hug.

152
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:49,277
Told her to call me if she needed
anything, and that was it.

153
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,404
End of story.

154
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,824
Sam, I am trying to help you here.

155
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,119
But you have got to be honest
with me.

156
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,622
Now, we have an eyewitness.

157
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,041
Someone who saw two men...

158
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,295
...fitting your and your brother's
description breaking into Giles' office.

159
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,632
Look, Karen called us later,
said there was stuff she wanted...

160
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,718
...from Tony's office,
but the police weren't letting her in.

161
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,055
Like a picture of the two of them
in Paris, and some other stuff.

162
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,934
Look, it was wrong to enter
a crime scene, but she gave us the key.

163
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,323
Hey.

164
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,660
Anthony Giles' body was found
right about here.

165
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,581
"Throat slit so deep,
part of his spinal cord was visible."

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,166
What do you think?

167
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,669
Vengeful spirit, underline vengeful?

168
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,170
Yeah, maybe.

169
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,465
I mean, he did see that woman
at the foot of his bed.

170
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,846
Hey, look at this.

171
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,058
Dana Shulps?

172
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,394
What's that? A name?

173
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,690
I don't know, but it's everywhere.

174
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,863
All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy.

175
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,549
Wow.

176
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,927
I'd say we've officially
crossed over into weird.

177
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,387
Maybe Giles knew her.

178
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,390
Maybe it's the name of our pale,
red-eyed mystery girl.

179
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:46,061
Well, let's see what we can see.

180
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,235
There's not a single mention
of a Dana Shulps anywhere.

181
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,737
There's not a D. Shulps...

182
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,281
- ...or any other kind of frigging Shulps.
- Great.

183
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,908
- What do you got?
- Nothing.

184
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,952
No Dana Shulps has ever lived
or died in Baltimore...

185
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,580
- ...in the last 50 years, at least.
- So, what now?

186
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,625
Well, I think I'm pretty close
to cracking Giles' password.

187
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,920
- Maybe something in his personal files.
- By close you mean...?

188
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,922
Thirty minutes maybe.

189
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,258
Awesome.

190
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,805
So I guess I just get to hang out.

191
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,599
So awesome.

192
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,989
- Dude, seriously.
- All right.

193
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,702
I'm gonna talk to Karen, see if she
knows anything about this Dana Shulps.

194
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,328
Great.

195
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,455
Keep going, sparky.

196
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,667
Dean went back to Karen's place
to check up on her.

197
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,295
I mean, you know,
she'd been pretty upset earlier.

198
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,339
So why didn't you go with him?

199
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,843
I just went back to the motel.

200
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,679
How'd you know I was there,
by the way?

201
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,683
We found the motel matchbook
on your brother when we arrested him.

202
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:12,147
Let's quit fooling around. You were
with your brother the whole time...

203
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,692
...you were in Baltimore.
Why separate now?

204
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,237
- Your brother left to go murder Karen.
- He didn't kill anyone.

205
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,990
I heard the 911 call.

206
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,825
Karen was terrified.

207
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,745
She said someone was in the house.

208
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,774
Emergency services.
- Hello.

209
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,902
- I think I saw somebody in my house.
- What is your address?

210
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,112
It's 421 Clinton Avenue.

211
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,075
Please, can you--? Hello?

212
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,212
Karen, you in there?

213
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,016
Oh, God.

214
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,531
Seriously, what the hell?

215
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,718
Freeze. Stay on your knees.

216
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,929
Hands where I can see them.

217
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,931
Now.

218
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,725
Cuff him.

219
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,573
- You getting anywhere with him?
- No.

220
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,243
Just a lot of wise-ass remarks.

221
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,953
You?

222
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,581
Sam's story matches Dean's
to the last detail.

223
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:45,420
Yeah? Well, these guys are good,
I'll give them that.

224
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,840
If we don't get Sam to flip,
we have nothing...

225
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,677
- ...but a lot of circumstantial evidence.
- We got Dean at the crime scene...

226
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,262
...with blood on his hands.

227
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,764
Juries have convicted for less.

228
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:00,018
Yeah, but, I mean,
where's the murder weapon?

229
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,687
What's the motive?
You talk about reasonable doubt--

230
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,439
Diana...

231
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,984
...do you have reasonable doubt?

232
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,366
We keep leaning on these guys,
one of them will tumble.

233
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,577
And don't forget about St. Louis.

234
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,623
I'm telling you,
this Dean guy is our guy.

235
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,709
I know Tony Giles
was a friend of yours.

236
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,003
Yeah, he was. He was a good friend.

237
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,839
Look, and I know you wanna
clean this mess up quick.

238
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:34,010
But come on, Tony knew a lot
of criminal types, maybe we just--

239
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,845
Criminal types?

240
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,139
He was a defense lawyer
for God's sakes.

241
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,808
Of course he knew criminal types.

242
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,644
Okay. All right, let's get back at them.

243
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,063
No. You know what?

244
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,024
Let them stew in their juices for a bit.

245
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,615
Come here.

246
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,257
Dana Shulps, Dana Shulps,
Dana Shulps.

247
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,926
Dana-- Dana Shulps.

248
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,688
Maybe it's not a name.
Maybe it's not a name.

249
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,650
Anagram maybe?

250
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,709
- Mr. Winchester?
- Yeah.

251
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,295
I'm Jeff Krause.

252
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,715
I'm with the public defender's office.

253
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,175
I'm your lawyer.

254
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,595
Oh, thank God, I'm saved.

255
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,932
Hey, can I steal a pen from you,
some paper?

256
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,268
Sure.

257
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:10,815
Well, the police haven't found
a weapon yet, so that's good.

258
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,068
But they got your prints...

259
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,447
...and, literally, blood on your hands.

260
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,576
And with your police record...

261
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,706
Mr. Winchester, what are you doing?

262
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,458
- I think it's an anagram.
- A what?

263
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,752
An anagram.
Same letters, different words.

264
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,590
Could you do me a favor?

265
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,842
See if you recognize
any of these words.

266
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,928
Local names, places,
anything like that?

267
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,806
Do you understand how serious
these charges are?

268
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,935
I'm handcuffed to a table.
Yeah, I get it.

269
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,272
Humor me. Take a quick look.

270
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,153
Well...

271
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,823
S- U-P, I don't know about that...

272
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,951
...but Ashland is a street name.

273
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,747
- It's not far from here.
- Street?

274
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,627
Let's start with where you were
the night that Anthony Giles died.

275
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:16,547
- Can you get in to see my brother?
- Mr. Winchester...

276
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,799
...you could be facing
a death penalty here.

277
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,636
Hey, thanks
for the law review, Matlock.

278
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,305
But if you wanna help me...

279
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,893
...I need you to see my brother.

280
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,563
I hope that was meaningful.

281
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,191
But I'd like to discuss your case now.

282
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,902
Sure thing, Matlock.

283
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,530
You two really are brothers,
aren't you?

284
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,909
Now, as you know...

285
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,036
...the DA might be interested in--

286
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,958
We need you. With the other one.

287
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,556
Counselor...

288
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,475
...your boy decided to confess.

289
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,229
Mr. Winchester,
I'd advise against that strongly.

290
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,231
Talk directly into the camera.

291
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,276
Start by stating your name
for the record.

292
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,864
My name is Dean Winchester.

293
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,075
I'm an Aquarius. I enjoy sunsets...

294
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,454
...long walks on the beach,
and frisky women.

295
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,999
And I did not kill anyone.
But I know who did.

296
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,460
Or rather, what did.

297
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:21,797
Of course, it can't be for sure, because
our investigation was interrupted.

298
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,759
Our working theory
is that we're looking for a kind of...

299
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,260
...vengeful spirit.

300
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:27,803
Excuse me?

301
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,639
You know,
Casper the bloodthirsty ghost?

302
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,684
Tony Giles saw it.

303
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,936
I'll bet you cash money
Karen did too.

304
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,606
The interesting thing
is the word it leaves behind.

305
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,609
For some reason, it's trying
to tell us something.

306
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,446
But communicating
across the veil ain't easy.

307
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:49,033
Sometimes the spirits,
they get things jumbled.

308
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,119
You remember redrum?
Same concept.

309
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,414
You know, it's...
Could be word fragments.

310
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,625
Other times...

311
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,004
...it's anagrams.

312
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,132
See, at first we thought
this was a name, Dana Shulps.

313
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,470
But now, we think it's a street.
Ashland.

314
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,722
Whatever's going on...

315
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:16,143
- ...I'm betting it started there.
- You arrogant bastard.

316
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,813
Tony and Karen were good people.
You're making jokes.

317
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,689
I'm not joking, Ponch.

318
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,570
You murdered them in cold blood
just like that girl in St. Louis.

319
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,322
Oh, yeah, that wasn't me either.

320
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,450
That was a shapeshifter creature
that only looked like me.

321
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,494
Get up.
Hey, hey.

322
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,996
Pete, that is enough.

323
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,500
You asked for the truth.

324
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,838
Lock his ass up.

325
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,685
What the hell?

326
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,729
Where is he?

327
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,031
What'd he do?

328
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,367
The fire escape's way over--

329
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,580
- What?
- These two guys.

330
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,419
Hilts and McQueen?
What is that?

331
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,006
Hilts is Steve McQueen's character
in The Great Escape.

332
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,527
Can we make this quick?
I'm a little tired.

333
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,696
It's been a long day,
with your partner assaulting me and all.

334
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:36,450
I wanna know more about that stuff
you were talking about earlier.

335
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:40,287
Time Life, Mysteries of the Unknown.
Look it up.

336
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:49,672
Let's pretend for the moment
you're not entirely insane.

337
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,635
What would one of these things
be doing here?

338
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:55,970
A vengeful spirit?

339
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,059
Well, they're created
by violent deaths.

340
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,312
And then they come back
for a reason, usually a nasty one.

341
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,856
Like revenge on the people
that hurt them.

342
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,111
And these spirits...

343
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,822
...they're capable of killing people?

344
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,121
Where did you get that?

345
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,003
I don't know.

346
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,131
It wasn't there before.

347
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,009
You've seen it, haven't you?

348
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,928
- The spirit.
- How did you know?

349
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,681
Because Karen had the same bruises
on her wrists.

350
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,852
I bet that if you look at Giles'
autopsy photos, he's got them too.

351
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,939
It's got something to do
with this spirit. I don't know what.

352
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,528
I know.

353
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,196
You think you're going crazy.

354
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,907
Well, let's skip that part, shall we?

355
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,619
Because the last two people
who saw this thing...

356
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,371
...died pretty soon after.

357
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,458
You hear me?

358
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,295
You think I'm gonna die?

359
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,882
You need to go to Sam. He'll help.

360
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,552
You're giving your brother up?

361
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,556
Go to the first motel in the yellow pages.
Look for Jim Rockford.

362
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,808
It's how we find each other
when we separate.

363
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,894
You can arrest him if you want.

364
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,730
Or you can let him save your life.

365
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,290
These showed up after you saw it?

366
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,334
Yeah, I guess.

367
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:51,919
All right.

368
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,089
You're gonna have to tell me
exactly what you saw.

369
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,091
You know, I must be losing my mind.

370
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,637
You're a fugitive.
I should be arresting you.

371
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,931
All right, well, you know what?

372
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,850
You can arrest me later.
After you live through this.

373
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,604
But right now,
you gotta talk to me. Okay?

374
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,859
Okay, great. Now, the spirit,
what did it look like?

375
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,945
She was...

376
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,988
...really pale.

377
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,949
And her throat was cut.

378
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,660
And her eyes, they were like
this deep dark red.

379
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:29,623
It appeared like she was trying
to talk to me, but she couldn't.

380
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:33,252
It was just a lot of blood.

381
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,465
You know what? Here. I've been
researching every girl who's died...

382
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,968
...or gone missing
from Ashland Street.

383
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,554
How'd you get those?

384
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,848
Those are from crime scenes
and booking photos.

385
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,476
You have your job, I have mine.

386
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:54,523
Here, I need you to look through these,
tell me if you recognize anyone.

387
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,786
This is her.

388
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,164
I'm sure of it.

389
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:15,169
"Claire Becker, 28 years old. Disappeared
about eight or nine months ago."

390
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,004
But I don't even know her.

391
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,797
Why would she come after me?

392
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:24,178
Well, before her death, she was
arrested twice for dealing heroin.

393
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,013
- You ever work Narcotics?
- Yeah.

394
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,432
Pete and I did. Before Homicide.

395
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,602
- You ever bust her?
- Not that I remember.

396
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,233
It says she was last seen
entering 2911 Ashland Street.

397
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:42,529
Police searched the place,
didn't find anything.

398
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:48,202
Guess we gotta check it out ourselves.
See if we can find her body.

399
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,204
What?

400
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:55,876
Well, we gotta salt and burn her bones.
It's the only way to put her spirit to rest.

401
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,795
Of course it is.

402
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,896
So, what exactly
are we looking for?

403
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,649
I'll let you know when we find it.

404
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,620
Sam.

405
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,292
Sam.

406
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,337
Sam!

407
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,549
Hey. Hey, I'm here. What is it?

408
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,968
- What happened?
- Claire.

409
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,928
- Where?
- She was here.

410
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,346
Did she attack you?

411
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,182
No. No, she was just, like,
reaching out to me.

412
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,060
She was over there by the window.

413
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,574
Hey, wait. Help me move this.

414
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,668
Our little mystery word.

415
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,850
Now the extra letters make sense.

416
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,523
What is that?

417
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:28,987
Well, spirits and certain remains
give off electro-magnetic frequencies.

418
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,950
So if Claire's body was here,
that would indicate that?

419
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,910
Yeah. Well, that's the theory.

420
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,897
Yeah, yeah. There's definitely
something in there.

421
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,947
You know, this is bothering me.

422
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,282
Well, you are digging up a corpse.

423
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:19,621
No, not that. That's pretty
par for the course, actually.

424
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,331
Then what?

425
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:25,752
It's just... I mean, no vengeful spirit
I've ever tussled with...

426
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,464
...wanted to be wasted. So why
would Claire lead us to her remains?

427
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,925
It doesn't make any sense.

428
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,265
All right, here. Give me a hand.

429
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,218
Her wrists.

430
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,471
Yeah, they'd be bruised
just like yours.

431
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,234
That necklace
mean something to you?

432
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,237
I've seen it before.

433
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:39,159
It's rare. It was custom-made
over on Carson Street.

434
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,707
I have one just like it.

435
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,544
Pete gave it to me.

436
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,177
- Now this all makes perfect sense.
- I'm sorry?

437
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,596
Yeah, you see,
Claire is not a vengeful spirit.

438
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,847
She's a death omen.

439
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,849
Excuse me?

440
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,393
Claire's not killing anyone.

441
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,020
She's trying to warn them.

442
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,359
See, sometimes spirits don't
want vengeance, they want justice.

443
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,236
Which is why she led us here.

444
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,571
She wants us to know
who her killer is.

445
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,745
How much do you know
about your partner?

446
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,127
- Oh, my God.
- What?

447
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:35,882
About a year ago, some heroin
went missing from lockup.

448
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,051
Obviously it was a cop.

449
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,846
We never found out who did it.

450
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,641
But whoever did it would need
someone to fence their product.

451
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,893
Somebody like a heroin dealer.

452
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,397
Somebody like Claire.

453
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:58,405
So I'm being extradited
to St. Louis, huh?

454
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:04,244
And you just decided to transfer me
yourself, 800 miles at 2 in the morning?

455
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,418
This can't be good.

456
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,670
All right, thanks.

457
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,298
- What is it?
- Pete just left the precinct.

458
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,924
- With Dean.
- What?

459
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:21,428
He said the prisoner had to be
transferred, and he just took him.

460
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,139
Dispatch has been calling.
He won't answer the radio.

461
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,434
- Radio? He took a county vehicle?
- Yeah.

462
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,312
It should have a LoJack.
You just gotta get it turned on.

463
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,204
Pee break? So soon?

464
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,415
You know, you might wanna
get your prostate checked.

465
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,050
Son of a bitch.

466
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,806
Hey, I'm cool in the van.
You go do what you gotta do.

467
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,480
You're a cocky son of a bitch.

468
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,983
You think those people in St. Louis
are gonna buy that crap?

469
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,655
Here's the thing.
You're not gonna make it to St. Louis.

470
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,743
You're gonna die trying to escape.

471
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,538
Wait. Wait.

472
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:35,168
Let's talk about this. You don't wanna
do something you're gonna regret.

473
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,088
- Or maybe you do.
Pete.

474
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,466
- Put the gun down.
- Diana?

475
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,717
How'd you find me?

476
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,511
I know about Claire.

477
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,555
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Put the gun down.

478
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,599
Oh, I don't think so.

479
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,103
You're fast. Pretty sure I'm faster.

480
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,232
- Why are you doing this?
- I didn't do anything, Diana.

481
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,734
It's a little late for that.

482
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,362
It wasn't my fault.

483
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,031
Claire was gonna turn me in.
I had no choice.

484
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,534
And Tony? Karen?

485
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,119
Same thing.

486
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,746
Tony scrubbed the money.
Then he got skittish...

487
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:16,042
...and then he wanted to come clean.
I'm sure he told Karen everything.

488
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,503
It was a mess, I had to clean it up.

489
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,380
I just panicked.

490
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,882
How many more people
are gonna die over this?

491
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,552
There's a way out.

492
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:30,890
This Dean kid's a frigging gift.
We can pin the whole thing on him.

493
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:35,145
Okay? No trial, nothing,
just one more dead scumbag.

494
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,813
Hey.

495
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,400
No one will question it.

496
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,736
Diana, please...

497
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,322
...I still love you.

498
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,664
Thank you. Thank you.

499
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,968
Yeah, why don't you buy me
another necklace, you ass.

500
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,432
Don't do it. Don't do it.

501
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,402
You doing all right?

502
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,570
Not really.

503
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,323
The death omen, Claire.

504
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,827
- What happens to her now?
- It should be over.

505
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,453
She should be at rest.

506
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,041
So, what now, officer?

507
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:24,337
Pete did confess to me,
he screwed up both your cases royally.

508
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,757
I'd say there's a good chance
that we can get your cases dismissed.

509
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,468
- You could take care of that for us?
- I hope so.

510
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,679
But the St. Louis murder charges?

511
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,848
That's another story.

512
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,933
I can't help you.

513
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,811
Unless...

514
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,730
...I just happened to turn my back,
and you walked away.

515
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,899
I could tell them
the suspects escaped.

516
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,193
- Wait, are you sure?
- Yeah, she's sure, Sam.

517
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:50,738
No, it's just you could lose
your job over something like that.

518
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,283
I want you guys out there
doing what you do best.

519
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,368
Trust me. I'll sleep better at night.

520
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,246
Listen, you need to watch your back.

521
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,707
They're gonna be looking
for both of you now.

522
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,626
Get out of here. I gotta radio this in.

523
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:07,589
Hey, wouldn't happen to know
where my car is by chance?

524
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,300
It's at the impound yard on Robertson.

525
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,845
Don't even think about it.

526
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,347
It's okay, it's all right.
Don't worry. We'll...

527
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,475
We'll just improvise.
We're good at that.

528
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:21,311
Yeah, I've noticed.

529
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,943
- Nice lady.
- Yeah, for a cop.

530
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,529
- Does she look familiar to you?
No, why?

531
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,448
I don't know.
Anyway, are you hungry?

532
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,991
No.
For some reason...

533
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,743
...I could really go for some pea soup.
