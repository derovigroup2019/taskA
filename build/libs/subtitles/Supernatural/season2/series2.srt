1
00:00:00,463 --> 00:00:01,642
It's not a dream.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,739
You ever heard of an out-of-body experience?

3
00:00:03,774 --> 00:00:05,235
We're spirits...

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,645
of people close to death.

5
00:00:07,646 --> 00:00:09,678
<b>time has come today</b>

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,620
Your son is dying,
and you're worried about the colt?

7
00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:16,106
You shoot me in the heart, son!

8
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,486
You're bringing the demon here,
aren't you?

9
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:21,945
Having some stupid, macho showdown!

10
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,760
If you killed that damn thing
when you had the chance,

11
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:26,894
none of this would have happened.

12
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:29,930
<i>The rules have changed today...</i>

13
00:00:30,536 --> 00:00:33,725
<i>Hey! I have no place to stay...</i>

14
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:35,282
I want to make a deal.

15
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:39,011
You're much prettier
than the last reaper I met.

16
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:42,473
I will give you the colt and the bullet.
But you got to help Dean.

17
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:43,772
<i>Time!</i>

18
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:45,542
So, we have a deal?

19
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:48,341
You still need to sweeten the pot.

20
00:00:48,346 --> 00:00:49,270
<i>Time!</i>

21
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:52,661
Today is your lucky day, kid.

22
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:54,190
<i>Time!</i>

23
00:00:54,925 --> 00:00:57,002
You watch out for Sammy, okay?

24
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:01,312
<i>Time!</i>

25
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:06,430
Okay.

26
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:07,722
Dad?

27
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:13,581
Time of death, 10:41 a.m.

28
00:01:13,587 --> 00:01:14,781
<i>Time!</i>

29
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:42,652
God, I hate clowns.
Always creep me out.

30
00:01:42,657 --> 00:01:44,212
Shh! She likes them.

31
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:55,021
Last ride, Nora.

32
00:02:08,938 --> 00:02:10,610
Look, mom, another clown.

33
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:18,221
What are you trying to do,
scare your father?

34
00:02:18,227 --> 00:02:19,222
Honey.

35
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:37,262
Look, mom, a clown.

36
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:43,621
You missed him.

00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:38,781
Before he...

40
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:40,980
Before he...

41
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:47,470
Did he say anything to you?

42
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:51,501
About anything?

43
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:00,662
No.

44
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:05,972
Nothing.

45
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,681
How's the car coming along?

46
00:05:46,688 --> 00:05:47,612
Slow.

47
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:49,562
Yeah?

48
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:52,650
You need any help?

49
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:54,203
What?
You under a hood?

50
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:55,943
I'll pass.

51
00:05:58,518 --> 00:05:59,713
Need anything else, then?

52
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:03,302
Stop it, Sam.

53
00:06:04,105 --> 00:06:04,951
Stop what?

54
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,282
Stop asking if I need anything.

55
00:06:06,297 --> 00:06:08,751
Stop asking if I'm okay.
I'm okay.

56
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:11,062
Really. I promise.

57
00:06:14,886 --> 00:06:16,583
All right, Dean, it's just...

58
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:21,110
We've been at Bobby's for over a week now,
and you haven't brought up dad once.

59
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:24,200
You know what? You're right.

60
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:26,232
Come here.

61
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,540
I'm gonna lay my head gently
on your shoulder.

62
00:06:28,696 --> 00:06:30,942
Maybe we could cry, hug,

63
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:33,451
- maybe even slow dance.
- Don't patronize me, Dean.

64
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:36,880
Dad is dead, the colt is gone,
and it seems pretty damn likely

65
00:06:36,886 --> 00:06:39,522
that the demon is behind all of this.
And you're acting like nothing happened.

66
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:40,972
- What do you want me to say?
- Say something, all right?!

67
00:06:40,976 --> 00:06:44,252
Hell, say anything!
Aren't you angry? Don't you want revenge?

68
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:47,860
But all you do is sit out here all day long
buried underneath this damn car.

69
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,860
- Revenge, huh? Sounds good.
- Yeah!

70
00:06:50,468 --> 00:06:52,353
Got any leads on where the demon is?

71
00:06:52,356 --> 00:06:55,130
Making heads or tails of any
of dad's research? 'Cause I sure ain't.

72
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:56,792
You know, when we do finally find it...

73
00:06:56,797 --> 00:06:57,860
Oh,

74
00:06:57,868 --> 00:06:59,813
no, wait,
like you said, the colt's gone.

75
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:01,692
But I'm sure you figured out
another way to kill it.

76
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:04,180
We've got nothing, Sam.
Nothing, okay?

77
00:07:04,185 --> 00:07:07,032
The only thing I can do is
I can work on the car.

78
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:10,870
Well, we got something, all right?

79
00:07:11,757 --> 00:07:13,381
It's what I came out here to tell you.

80
00:07:13,387 --> 00:07:14,851
It's one of dad's old phones.

81
00:07:14,855 --> 00:07:18,131
It took me a while, but I cracked
his voice mail code. Listen to this.

82
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:24,293
<i>John, it's Ellen...
Again.</i>

83
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:27,360
<i>Look, don't be stubborn.
You know I can help you. Call me.</i>

84
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:30,440
That message is four months old.

85
00:07:30,447 --> 00:07:32,231
Dad saved that chick's message
for four months?

86
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:33,471
- Yeah.
- Who's Ellen?

87
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:35,142
- Any mention of her in dad's journal?
- No,

88
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:37,690
but I ran a trace on the number,
and I got an address.

89
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:42,262
Ask Bobby if we can use one of his cars.

90
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,521
<b>title</b>

91
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:51,071
<i>Do that to me one more time...</i>

92
00:07:51,078 --> 00:07:52,922
<i>I can ne...</i>

93
00:07:53,828 --> 00:07:55,541
This is humiliating.

94
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,571
I feel like a friggin' soccer mom.

95
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:03,860
It's the only car Bobby had running.

96
00:08:06,838 --> 00:08:08,190
H ello?

97
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:11,962
- Anybody here?
- Alright.

98
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:14,182
- Hey, did you bring the...
- Of course.

99
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,782
Hey, buddy?

100
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:51,213
- I'm guessing that isn't Ellen.
- Yeah.

101
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,332
Oh, god, please let that be a rifle.

102
00:09:12,088 --> 00:09:13,911
No, I'm just real happy to see you.

103
00:09:14,606 --> 00:09:16,780
- Don't move.
- Not moving. Copy that.

104
00:09:18,298 --> 00:09:19,771
You should know something, miss.

105
00:09:19,846 --> 00:09:21,531
When you put a rifle on someone,

106
00:09:21,535 --> 00:09:23,631
you don't want to put it
right against their back,

107
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:26,013
'cause it makes it real easy to do...

108
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:29,782
that!

109
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:31,803
Sam!

110
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,550
I need some help in here.

111
00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:35,173
I can't see. I can't even see!

112
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:36,400
Sorry, Dean.

113
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:38,993
I can't right now.
I'm a...

114
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:40,883
little  tied up.

115
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:44,912
Sam? Dean?

116
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:48,003
Winchester?

117
00:09:49,237 --> 00:09:50,071
Yeah.

118
00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:52,132
Son of a bitch.

119
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:53,422
Mom, you know these guys?

120
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:55,750
Yeah,  I think these are
John Winchester's boys.

121
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,131
Hey, I'm Ellen.

122
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:01,833
That's my daughter, Jo.

123
00:10:03,045 --> 00:10:03,870
Hey.

124
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,843
You're not gonna hit me again, are you?

125
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:08,080
Here you go.

126
00:10:08,088 --> 00:10:09,032
Thanks.

127
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:14,183
You called our dad, said you could help.

128
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:15,932
Help with what?

129
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:18,740
Well,

130
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:20,302
the demon, of course.

131
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:23,733
I heard he was closing in on it.

132
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:27,353
Was there an article in
"the demon hunter's quarterly" that I missed?

133
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:29,011
I mean, who are you?
How do you know about all this?

134
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:30,643
Hey, I just run a saloon.

135
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:34,752
But hunters have been known
to pass through now and again,

136
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,893
including your dad a long time ago.

137
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:38,473
- John was like family once.
- Oh yeah?

138
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:40,271
I mean he's never mentioned you before.

139
00:10:41,277 --> 00:10:43,190
You'd have to ask him that.

140
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:47,723
So, why exactly do we need your help?

141
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:49,550
Hey, don't do me any favors.

142
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,501
Look, if you don't want my help, fine.

143
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:53,533
Don't let the door smack your ass
on the way out.

144
00:10:53,691 --> 00:10:55,354
But John wouldn't have sent you if...

145
00:11:01,408 --> 00:11:02,540
He didn't send you.

146
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,375
He's all right, isn't he?

147
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:13,062
No.

148
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:15,550
No, he isn't.

149
00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:18,001
It was the demon, we think.

150
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:21,502
It just got him before he got it, I guess.

151
00:11:25,338 --> 00:11:27,263
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

152
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:28,753
We're all right.

153
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:30,883
Really, I know how close you and your dad...

154
00:11:30,885 --> 00:11:32,311
Really, lady, I'm fine.

155
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,532
So, look, if you can help...

156
00:11:39,806 --> 00:11:41,923
we could use all the help we can get.

157
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:43,721
Well, we can't.

158
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:46,303
But Ash will.

159
00:11:46,308 --> 00:11:48,242
- Who's Ash?
- Ash!

160
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:51,161
What?

161
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:54,752
Closing time?

162
00:11:56,915 --> 00:11:58,152
That's Ash?

163
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:00,153
He's a genius.

164
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:05,140
You got to be kidding me.
This guy's no genius.

165
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:06,993
He's a Lynyrd Skynyrd roadie.

166
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:09,742
- I like you.
- Thanks.

167
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:11,211
Just give him a chance.

168
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:17,120
All right.

169
00:12:18,548 --> 00:12:21,840
Well, this stuff's about a year's worth
of our dad's work. So

170
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:24,102
let's see what you make of it.

171
00:12:34,978 --> 00:12:39,972
Come on. This crap ain't real.
Ain't nobody can track a demon like this.

172
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:45,243
Our dad could.

173
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:50,742
These are
nonparametric statistical overviews,

174
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:53,782
cross-spectrum correlations.
I mean...

175
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:55,592
Damn!

176
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,623
They're signs,

177
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:02,690
omens. If you can track them,
you can track this demon.

178
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:06,631
You know, like crop failures,
electrical storms.

179
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:10,562
You ever been struck by lightning?
It ain't fun.

180
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:14,512
- Can you track it or not?
- Yeah, with this, I think so.

181
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,600
But it's gonna take time.
Give me...

182
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:21,573
51 hours.

183
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:28,870
- Hey, man!
- Yeah?

184
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:31,332
By the way, I dig the haircut.

185
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:34,600
All business up front,

186
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:36,401
party in the back.

187
00:13:49,398 --> 00:13:50,850
Hey, Ellen, what is that?

188
00:13:51,975 --> 00:13:53,441
It's a police scanner.

189
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:58,093
- We keep tabs on things.
- No, no, no, no. The... folder.

190
00:14:05,897 --> 00:14:08,400
I was gonna give this to
a friend of mine, but

191
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:10,052
take a look

192
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:10,962
if you want.

193
00:14:12,756 --> 00:14:13,470
Thanks.

194
00:14:14,878 --> 00:14:16,843
How did your mom get into this stuff,
anyway?

195
00:14:16,848 --> 00:14:17,840
My dad.

196
00:14:18,077 --> 00:14:19,153
He was a hunter.

197
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:21,802
He passed away.

198
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:24,550
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:26,203
It was a long time ago.

200
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:27,861
I was just a kid.

201
00:14:29,878 --> 00:14:31,252
Sorry to hear about yo dad.

202
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:34,120
Yeah.

203
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:37,881
So,

204
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:41,432
I guess I got 51 hours to waste.

205
00:14:41,728 --> 00:14:43,411
Maybe tonight we should...

206
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:51,503
Oh, you know what? Never mind.

207
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:54,603
- What?
- Nothing, just...

208
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,353
Wrong place, wrong time.

209
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,823
I thought you were gonna toss me
some cheap pickup line.

210
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:03,273
Most hunters come through that door,
think they can get in my pants with some

211
00:15:03,787 --> 00:15:06,891
pizza, a six-pack
and side one of "Zeppelin 4".

212
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:10,012
What a bunch of scumbags.

213
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:12,783
Not you.

214
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:15,301
I guess not.

215
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:18,833
Dean, come here. Check this out.

216
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,440
Yeah.

217
00:15:22,508 --> 00:15:26,303
A few murders not far from here
that Ellen caught wind of.

218
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:28,193
Looks to me like there might be a hunt.

219
00:15:28,196 --> 00:15:30,523
- Yeah, so?
- So,

220
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:32,030
I told her we'd check it out.

221
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,650
You got to be kidding me.
Killer clown?

222
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:38,900
Yeah, he left the daughter unharmed
and killed the parents.

223
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,370
Ripped them to pieces, actually.

224
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:42,410
And this family was at some carnival
that night?

225
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:45,042
Right, the Cooper carnival.

226
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:47,840
How do you know we're not dealing
with some psycho carny in a clown suit?

227
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:52,241
The cops have no leads, and all the employees
were tearing down shop...

228
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:56,250
Alibis all around. Plus the girl said
she saw a clown vanish into thin air.

229
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:59,692
- Cops are saying trauma, of course.
- I know what you're thinking, Sam.

230
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:01,810
"Why did it have to be clowns?"

231
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:03,663
Oh, give me a break.

232
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,360
You didn't think I remembered, did you?

233
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:10,082
Come on, you still bust out crying whenever
you see Ronald Mcdonald on the television.

234
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,430
At least I'm not afraid of flying.

235
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,920
-  Planes crash!
- And apparently clowns kill.

236
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:19,853
So, these types of murders,
they ever happen before?

237
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:23,590
Uh, according to the file,
1981, the

238
00:16:23,596 --> 00:16:26,171
Bunker Brothers Circus.

239
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:30,140
Same m.o. It happened three different times,
three different locales.

240
00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:34,593
It's weird though. If it is a spirit, it's usually
bound to a specific locale. A house or a town.

241
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:37,260
How's this one moving from city to city?
Carnival to carnival?

242
00:16:37,265 --> 00:16:38,543
Cursed object, maybe.

243
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:41,281
Spirit attaches itself to something,
and the

244
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:45,381
- carnival carries it around.
- Great. Paranormal scavenger hunt.

245
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:48,173
This case was your idea.

246
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:51,722
By the way, why is that?
You were awfully quick to jump on this job.

247
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:55,040
- So?
- So this is not like you, that's all.

248
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:58,510
I thought you were hell-bent for
leather on the demon hunt.

249
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:00,942
I don't know. I just think

250
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:03,823
taking this job, it's what dad
would have wanted us to do.

251
00:17:04,265 --> 00:17:06,623
- What dad would have wanted?
- Yeah.

252
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:08,950
So?

253
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:13,943
Nothing.

254
00:17:21,466 --> 00:17:22,680
Check it out.

255
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,091
Evan, look.

256
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:31,611
- Scary!
- Yeah, dad, scary.

257
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:32,613
What's over here?

258
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:42,020
You know, when I was your age,
this would have scared the pants off me.

259
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:06,343
Evan.

260
00:18:06,656 --> 00:18:07,472
Hey.

261
00:18:09,118 --> 00:18:10,032
What is it?

262
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:13,001
I...

263
00:18:13,377 --> 00:18:14,762
I saw a clown.

264
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:18,620
Don't be afraid of clowns.

265
00:18:18,937 --> 00:18:21,273
They're nice. They're your friends.

266
00:18:21,286 --> 00:18:23,472
Okay? Come on.

267
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,681
Dad.

268
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:40,552
Dad!

269
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,343
Evan.

270
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,713
What is it?

271
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:46,922
You were right.

272
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:48,913
He is my friend.

273
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:16,281
Check it out.

274
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,270
Five-O.

275
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:42,771
Did you get her number?

276
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:49,670
- More murders?
- Two more last night.

277
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:51,203
Apparently, they were ripped to shreds,

278
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:53,000
and they had a little boy with them.

279
00:19:53,016 --> 00:19:54,730
Who fingered a clown.

280
00:19:58,756 --> 00:19:59,581
W hat?

281
00:20:00,228 --> 00:20:02,812
Yes, a clown, who apparently vanished
into thin air.

282
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,820
Dean, you know, looking for
a cursed object, it's like

283
00:20:06,345 --> 00:20:09,360
trying to find a needle in
a stack of needles. It could be anything.

284
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:13,493
Well, it's bound to give off emf.
So we'll just have to scan everything.

285
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:17,880
Oh, good. That's nice and inconspicuous.

286
00:20:18,128 --> 00:20:20,161
I guess we'll just have to blend in.

287
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:33,033
Excuse me.

288
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:35,471
We're looking for a Mr. Cooper.
Have you seen him around?

289
00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:37,670
What is that? Some kind of joke?

290
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:43,820
- Oh, god, I'm sorry.
- You think I wouldn't give my eyeteeth

291
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:48,440
to see Mr. Cooper or a sunset
or anything at all?

292
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,711
Want to give me a little help here?

293
00:20:49,718 --> 00:20:50,670
Not really.

294
00:20:50,676 --> 00:20:52,680
Hey, Barry, is there a problem?

295
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:57,620
- Yeah, this guy hates blind people.
- No, I don't.

296
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,742
- Hey, buddy, what's your problem?
- Nothing. It's just a little misunderstanding.

297
00:21:00,748 --> 00:21:01,753
Little?

298
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:03,711
- You son of a bitch.
- No, no, no!

299
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:06,083
Could somebody tell me where Mr. Cooper is?

300
00:21:06,636 --> 00:21:07,831
Please?

301
00:21:07,837 --> 00:21:10,000
You boys picked a hell of a time to join up.

302
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:11,511
Take a seat.

303
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:14,632
We got all kinds of local trouble.

304
00:21:16,406 --> 00:21:17,680
What do you mean?

305
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:21,923
A couple of folks got themselves murdered.
Cops always seem to start here first.

306
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:24,582
So, you two ever work the circuit before?

307
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:27,881
Uh, yes, sir.
Last year through Texas and Arkansas.

308
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:29,520
Doing what?

309
00:21:30,227 --> 00:21:31,353
Ride jockeys?

310
00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:32,783
Pull shoot?

311
00:21:33,637 --> 00:21:35,672
- A-And-S men?
- Yeah, it's a...

312
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:37,480
little bit of everything, I guess.

313
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:43,380
You two have never worked a show
in your lives before, have you?

314
00:21:44,615 --> 00:21:45,493
Nope.

315
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:47,741
But we really need the work.

316
00:21:49,717 --> 00:21:51,823
And Sam here's got a thing
for the bearded lady.

317
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:57,651
You see that picture?

318
00:21:58,835 --> 00:21:59,850
That's my daddy.

319
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:01,401
You look just like him.

320
00:22:01,577 --> 00:22:02,861
He was in the business.

321
00:22:03,648 --> 00:22:06,542
Ran a freak show
'til they outlawed them most places.

322
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:10,270
Apparently displaying the deformed
isn't dignified.

323
00:22:10,276 --> 00:22:13,712
So, most of the performers went
from honest work to rotting in

324
00:22:13,718 --> 00:22:15,662
hospitals and asylums.

325
00:22:16,955 --> 00:22:18,181
That's progress,

326
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:19,702
I guess.

327
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,561
You see, this place

328
00:22:23,636 --> 00:22:25,492
is a refuge for outcasts.

329
00:22:25,657 --> 00:22:26,922
Always has been.

330
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,501
For folks that don't fit in nowhere else.

331
00:22:31,398 --> 00:22:32,310
But you two...

332
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:36,183
you should go to school,

333
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:38,132
find a couple of girls,

334
00:22:38,428 --> 00:22:40,401
have 2.5 kids,

335
00:22:40,407 --> 00:22:41,953
live regular.

336
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:47,473
Sir...

337
00:22:49,817 --> 00:22:51,012
We don't want to go to school.

338
00:22:51,435 --> 00:22:53,110
And we don't want regular.

339
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:55,253
We want this.

340
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:00,343
What?

341
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:04,551
That whole
"I don't want to go back to school" thing,

342
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:05,561
you just...

343
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:08,533
You were just saying that to Cooper,
or were you,

344
00:23:08,878 --> 00:23:09,790
you know,

345
00:23:09,795 --> 00:23:10,712
saying it?

346
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,472
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

347
00:23:15,486 --> 00:23:17,623
I thought that once the demon was dead

348
00:23:17,628 --> 00:23:20,820
and the fat lady sings that you were gonna
take off, head back to wussy state.

349
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,602
I'm having second thoughts.

350
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,010
- Really?
- Yeah, I think...

351
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,451
Dad would have wanted me
to stick to the job.

352
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,280
Since when do you give a damn
what dad wanted?

353
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,900
You spent half your life doing
exactly what he didn't want.

354
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:34,662
Since he died, okay?

355
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,023
You have a problem with that?

356
00:23:41,407 --> 00:23:42,802
No, I don't have a problem at all.

357
00:24:45,896 --> 00:24:46,992
Who is this?

358
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:26,241
- Hello?
- Hey, man.

359
00:25:27,035 --> 00:25:28,941
What's the matter?
You sound like you just saw a clown.

360
00:25:29,646 --> 00:25:30,612
Very funny.

361
00:25:32,695 --> 00:25:34,030
Skeleton, actually.

362
00:25:35,177 --> 00:25:37,571
- Like a real human skeleton?
- In the fun house.

363
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,081
Listen, I was thinking.
What if

364
00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:42,211
the spirit isn't attached to a cursed object.
What if it's attached to its own remains.

365
00:25:42,216 --> 00:25:44,570
-  Did the bones give off emf?
- Well, no, but...

366
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:46,613
We should check it out anyway.
I'm heading to you.

367
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:51,341
What are you doing here, kid?

368
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,943
- Just sweeping.
- Bull.

369
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:57,721
And what were you talking about?
Skeletons?

370
00:25:57,727 --> 00:25:59,373
What's emf?

371
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:02,751
Dude, your blind-man hearing is
out of control.

372
00:26:02,757 --> 00:26:04,931
We're a tight-knit group.
We don't like outsiders.

373
00:26:04,936 --> 00:26:07,390
We take care of our own problems.

374
00:26:08,315 --> 00:26:10,511
- We got a problem?
- You tell me. You're the one

375
00:26:10,517 --> 00:26:12,892
talking about human bones.

376
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:17,173
Do you believe in ghosts?

377
00:26:17,766 --> 00:26:18,542
What?

378
00:26:18,716 --> 00:26:19,821
My brother and me...

379
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:23,180
we're writing a book about them.

380
00:26:26,238 --> 00:26:27,990
- What took you so long?
- Long story.

381
00:26:27,996 --> 00:26:29,972
Mommy, look at the clown.

382
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:33,603
What clown?

383
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,861
Come on, sweetie. Come on.

384
00:26:54,025 --> 00:26:55,503
Dean, I cannot believe

385
00:26:55,507 --> 00:26:57,833
you told Papasian
about the homicidal phantom clown.

386
00:26:57,836 --> 00:27:00,740
I told him an urban legend
about a homicidal phantom clown.

387
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:02,153
- I never said it was real.
- Keep it down.

388
00:27:04,358 --> 00:27:05,530
Oh, and get this.

389
00:27:05,538 --> 00:27:07,700
I mentioned the
Bunker Brothers Circus in '81

390
00:27:07,786 --> 00:27:10,680
and their evil-clown apocalypse.
Guess what.

391
00:27:10,685 --> 00:27:11,473
What?

392
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:14,111
Before Mr. Cooper owned Cooper carnival,

393
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:15,952
he worked for the Bunker Brothers.

394
00:27:15,957 --> 00:27:17,151
He was their lot manager.

395
00:27:17,158 --> 00:27:19,070
So you think whatever's
the spirit attached to

396
00:27:19,088 --> 00:27:21,562
- Cooper just brought it with him?
- Something like that.

397
00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:26,370
I can't believe
we keep talking about clowns.

398
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:56,391
Want to come in and play?

399
00:28:11,006 --> 00:28:14,391
Want to see mommy and daddy?
They're upstairs.

400
00:28:16,336 --> 00:28:17,433
Hey!

401
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:28,792
Sam, watch out!

402
00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:34,833
What's going on in here?

403
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,091
- Oh, my god! What do you do to my daughter!
- Get away from my kid!

404
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:40,062
Mommy, daddy, they shot my clown.

405
00:28:50,576 --> 00:28:52,122
You really think they saw our plates?

406
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:55,422
I don't want to take the chance.

407
00:28:55,598 --> 00:28:57,622
Besides, I hate this freaking thing anyway.

408
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:01,433
Well, one thing's for sure.

409
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:02,421
What's that?

410
00:29:03,196 --> 00:29:04,621
We're not dealing with a spirit.

411
00:29:04,946 --> 00:29:06,720
That rock salt hit something solid.

412
00:29:06,918 --> 00:29:10,530
Yeah, a person, or maybe a creature
that can make itself invisible?

413
00:29:10,545 --> 00:29:12,550
Yeah, and dresses up like a clown for kicks?

414
00:29:12,555 --> 00:29:13,990
Did it say anything in dad's journal?

415
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:14,701
Nope.

416
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:19,060
Who you calling?

417
00:29:19,485 --> 00:29:22,022
Maybe Ellen or that guy Ash
will know something.

418
00:29:22,785 --> 00:29:24,461
Hey, you think, uh...

419
00:29:25,058 --> 00:29:27,023
You think dad and Ellen ever had a thing?

420
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:28,253
No way.

421
00:29:28,545 --> 00:29:30,321
Then why didn't he tell us about her?

422
00:29:30,706 --> 00:29:32,780
I don't know. Maybe
they had some sort of falling-out.

423
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,570
Yeah.

424
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:39,551
You ever notice dad had a falling-out
with just about everybody?

425
00:29:44,288 --> 00:29:45,912
Don't get all maudlin on me, man.

426
00:29:45,915 --> 00:29:46,743
What do you mean?

427
00:29:47,347 --> 00:29:51,160
I mean this strong, silent thing of yours.
It's crap. I'm over it.

428
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:53,443
This isn't just anyone we're talking about.
This is dad.

429
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:55,163
I know how you felt about the man.

430
00:29:55,165 --> 00:29:58,351
Back off, all right? Just because
I'm not caring and sharing like you want...

431
00:29:58,355 --> 00:30:01,293
No, no, no. That's not what this is about, Dean.
I don't care how you deal with this,

432
00:30:01,295 --> 00:30:03,080
but you have to deal with it, man.

433
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:06,890
Listen, I'm your brother, all right?
I just want to make sure you're okay.

434
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:08,782
Dude, I'm okay! I'm okay!

435
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:10,892
I swear, the next person
who asks me if I'm okay,

436
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:12,400
I'm gonna start throwing punches.

437
00:30:12,595 --> 00:30:14,913
These are your issues.
Quit dumping them on me.

438
00:30:14,915 --> 00:30:15,860
What are you talking about?

439
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:18,702
I just think it's really interesting
this sudden obedience you have to dad.

440
00:30:18,706 --> 00:30:20,563
It's like,
"oh, what would dad want me to do?"

441
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,371
You spent your entire life
slugging it out with that man.

442
00:30:23,377 --> 00:30:26,000
I mean, hell, you picked a fight with him
the last time you ever saw him,

443
00:30:26,006 --> 00:30:28,041
and now that he's dead,
now you wanna make it right?

444
00:30:28,045 --> 00:30:30,602
Well, I'm sorry, Sam, but you can't.
It's too little too late.

445
00:30:30,606 --> 00:30:31,753
Why are you saying this to me?

446
00:30:31,757 --> 00:30:35,511
I want you to be honest with yourself
about this! I'm dealing with dad's death.

447
00:30:35,985 --> 00:30:36,882
Are you?

448
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:43,811
I'm gonna call Ellen.

449
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:56,682
Thanks a lot.

450
00:30:58,866 --> 00:31:00,151
Rakshasa.

451
00:31:00,757 --> 00:31:03,102
- What's that?
- Ellen's best guess.

452
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:07,121
It's a race of ancient hindu creatures.
They appear in human form,

453
00:31:07,128 --> 00:31:09,083
they feed on human flesh,

454
00:31:09,397 --> 00:31:11,092
they can make themselves invisible,

455
00:31:11,096 --> 00:31:13,871
and they cannot enter a home
without first being invited to.

456
00:31:13,876 --> 00:31:16,421
They dress up like clowns, and
children invite them in.

457
00:31:16,426 --> 00:31:18,683
- Why don't they just munch on the kids?
- No idea.

458
00:31:18,868 --> 00:31:20,332
Not enough meat on the bones, maybe?

459
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:23,673
- What else you find out?
- Apparently, rakshasas live in squalor.

460
00:31:24,045 --> 00:31:26,741
They sleep on a bed of dead insects.

461
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:30,433
And they have to feed a few times.
Every 20 to 30 years.

462
00:31:30,437 --> 00:31:32,850
- Slow metabolism, I guess.
- That makes sense.

463
00:31:32,856 --> 00:31:35,850
The carnival today,
the Bunker Brothers in '81.

464
00:31:35,858 --> 00:31:38,111
Probably more before that.

465
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:40,450
Sam, who do we know that worked both shows?

466
00:31:40,455 --> 00:31:42,121
- Cooper?
- Cooper.

467
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,320
You know, that picture of his father,

468
00:31:45,588 --> 00:31:46,810
that looked just like him.

469
00:31:47,748 --> 00:31:49,082
You think maybe it was him?

470
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:51,723
Well, who knows how old he is?

471
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:53,041
Ellen say how to kill him?

472
00:31:53,525 --> 00:31:56,540
Legend goes a dagger made of pure brass.

473
00:31:58,587 --> 00:32:00,493
I think I know where to get one of those.

474
00:32:00,497 --> 00:32:03,701
Well, before we go stabbing things into Cooper,
we're gonna want to make damn sure it's him.

475
00:32:03,707 --> 00:32:06,383
Oh, you're such a stickler for details,
Sammy.

476
00:32:07,076 --> 00:32:08,872
All right, I'll round up the blade.

477
00:32:09,118 --> 00:32:11,250
You go check if Cooper's got bedbugs.

478
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:35,372
Well, I got all kinds of knives.

479
00:32:35,665 --> 00:32:38,210
I don't know if I got a brass one, though.

480
00:32:46,886 --> 00:32:48,000
What do you think you're doing?

481
00:32:50,318 --> 00:32:51,601
Check the trunk.

482
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,353
You?

483
00:33:13,606 --> 00:33:14,711
Me.

484
00:33:28,265 --> 00:33:29,371
All right!

485
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:31,860
Jeez.

486
00:33:34,077 --> 00:33:35,080
Hey!

487
00:33:35,756 --> 00:33:36,541
Hey!

488
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:40,112
So, Cooper thinks I'm a peeping tom,
but it's not him.

489
00:33:40,116 --> 00:33:41,361
Yeah, so I gathered.

490
00:33:41,378 --> 00:33:43,102
It's the blind guy. He's here somewhere.

491
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:45,282
- Well, did you get...
- The brass blades? No.

492
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:46,840
It's just been one of those days.

493
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:49,761
I got an idea. Come on.

494
00:34:01,378 --> 00:34:03,143
Dean, find the maze, okay?

495
00:34:43,055 --> 00:34:43,990
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

496
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:45,731
Shouldn't we see his clothes walking around?

497
00:35:00,607 --> 00:35:02,603
- Dean, where is it?
- I don't know!

498
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,170
Sam, behind you!

499
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:47,731
I hate fun houses.

500
00:36:03,068 --> 00:36:04,533
You boys did a hell of a job.

501
00:36:04,698 --> 00:36:06,560
- Your dad would be proud.
- Thanks.

502
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:17,512
Oh, yeah, I've got to, uh...

503
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:20,601
I've got to go...

504
00:36:21,037 --> 00:36:22,273
over there...

505
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,811
right now.

506
00:36:28,706 --> 00:36:30,550
- So.
- So.

507
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:33,431
Am I gonna see you again?

508
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:37,443
Do you want to?

509
00:36:39,495 --> 00:36:40,750
I wouldn't hate it.

510
00:36:41,556 --> 00:36:42,792
Can I be honest with you?

511
00:36:43,087 --> 00:36:44,202
See, normally,

512
00:36:44,206 --> 00:36:46,733
I'd be hitting on you so fast
it'd make your head spin.

513
00:36:47,098 --> 00:36:48,123
But

514
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:50,781
these days...

515
00:36:51,946 --> 00:36:52,773
I don't know.

516
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:54,413
Wrong place,

517
00:36:55,145 --> 00:36:56,500
wrong time?

518
00:36:58,087 --> 00:36:59,360
It's okay. I get it.

519
00:37:02,698 --> 00:37:04,691
Where you guys been?

520
00:37:04,837 --> 00:37:07,800
- I've been waiting for you.
- We were working a job, Ash.

521
00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:11,402
- Clowns?
- Clowns? What the...

522
00:37:11,408 --> 00:37:12,592
You got something for us, Ash?

523
00:37:13,507 --> 00:37:14,911
Did you find the demon?

524
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:16,321
It's nowhere around,

525
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,240
at least nowhere I can find.

526
00:37:18,256 --> 00:37:21,010
But if this fugly bastard raises its head,

527
00:37:21,508 --> 00:37:25,273
I'll know. I mean,
I'm on it like divine on dog dookie.

528
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:26,212
What do you mean?

529
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:28,241
I mean

530
00:37:28,968 --> 00:37:32,121
any of those signs or omens
appear anywhere in the world,

531
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,982
my rig will go off like a fire alarm.

532
00:37:35,855 --> 00:37:36,962
You mind?

533
00:37:41,395 --> 00:37:42,422
What's up, man?

534
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:46,251
Ash, where did you learn to do all this?

535
00:37:46,258 --> 00:37:50,382
M.I.T., before I got bounced for fighting.

536
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:53,623
M.I.T.?

537
00:37:53,895 --> 00:37:55,270
It's a school in Boston.

538
00:37:56,176 --> 00:37:56,981
Okay.

539
00:37:57,585 --> 00:37:59,133
Give us a call
as soon as you know something?

540
00:37:59,715 --> 00:38:01,403
S?, s?, compadre.

541
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:13,911
Hey, listen.

542
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:17,700
If you boys need a place to stay,
I got a couple beds out back.

543
00:38:19,217 --> 00:38:20,340
Thanks, but no.

544
00:38:21,547 --> 00:38:23,151
There's something I got to finish.

545
00:38:23,158 --> 00:38:23,983
Okay.

546
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:40,172
You were right.

547
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:42,592
About what?

548
00:38:47,256 --> 00:38:48,311
About me and dad.

549
00:38:49,297 --> 00:38:52,203
I'm sorry that the last time I was with him,
I tried to pick a fight.

550
00:38:52,637 --> 00:38:55,010
I'm sorry that I spent most of my life
angry at him.

551
00:38:55,157 --> 00:38:56,862
I mean, for all I know, he died

552
00:38:56,988 --> 00:38:58,320
thinking that I hate him.

553
00:39:00,516 --> 00:39:01,672
So, you're right.

554
00:39:03,818 --> 00:39:06,013
What I'm doing right now...
It is too little.

555
00:39:08,216 --> 00:39:09,213
It's too late.

556
00:39:14,658 --> 00:39:16,061
I miss him, man.

557
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:20,631
And I feel guilty as hell.

558
00:39:24,515 --> 00:39:25,892
And I'm not all right...

559
00:39:27,956 --> 00:39:29,011
not at all...

560
00:39:37,745 --> 00:39:38,940
But neither are you.

561
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:41,793
That much I know.

562
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:47,613
I'll let you get back to work.
