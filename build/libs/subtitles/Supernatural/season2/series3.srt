Resync: Xenzai[NEF]

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:04,705
I think he wants us to pick up
where he left off.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,620
<i>Saving people, hunting things.
Family business.</i>

4
00:00:09,351 --> 00:00:11,989
I don't understand the blind faith
you have in the man.

5
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:14,102
It's called being a good son.

6
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:18,504
You're just pissed off
you couldn't control me anymore.

7
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:30,418
lf only your boys knew
how much their daddy loved them.

8
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:39,660
Dad?

9
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:47,184
-Did he say anything to you?
-No.

10
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,029
I'm dealing with Dad's death.

11
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,148
Are you?

12
00:02:40,988 --> 00:02:43,786
Listen to her purr.
You ever heard anything so sweet?

13
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:46,143
lf you two wanna get a room,
just let me know.

14
00:02:46,308 --> 00:02:48,139
Oh, don't listen to him, baby.

15
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:50,703
He doesn't understand us.

16
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:54,461
-You're in a good mood.
-Why shouldn't I be?

17
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:57,338
-No reason.
-I got my car.

18
00:02:57,508 --> 00:03:00,067
Got a case. Things are looking up.

19
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:04,426
Give you a couple of severed heads
and a pile of dead cows...

20
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:07,021
...and you're Mr. Sunshine.

21
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,906
How far to Red Lodge?

22
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:11,740
About another 300 miles.

23
00:03:11,907 --> 00:03:13,340
Good.

24
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:21,222
The murder investigation is ongoing.
That's all I can share with the press.

25
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:23,696
Sure, we understand that.
But just for the record.

26
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:27,143
You found the first head last week,
correct?

27
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:30,420
Okay, and the other,
a Christina Flanagan.

28
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,663
-It was two days ago. Then--
-Excuse me, sir.

29
00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:35,345
Oh, thank you.

30
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,226
-Sorry, time's up. We're done here.
-One last question.

31
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,906
-About the cattle.
-Excuse me?

32
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:41,341
The cows found dead...

33
00:03:41,507 --> 00:03:44,863
...split open, drained,
over a dozen cases?

34
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,420
What about them?

35
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,583
So you don't think there's a connection?

36
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:51,342
Connection with...?

37
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:54,219
First, cattle mutilations.

38
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:57,140
Now, two murders.
Kind of sounds like ritual stuff.

39
00:03:57,307 --> 00:04:00,059
You know, like satanic-cult ritual stuff.

40
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:06,345
You... .

41
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:11,226
-You're not kidding.
-No.

42
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:15,746
Those cows aren't being mutilated.

43
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:17,783
-You wanna know how I know?
-How?

44
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:20,745
Because there's no such thing
as cattle mutilation.

45
00:04:20,907 --> 00:04:22,897
Cow drops, leave it in the sun...

46
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:26,422
...within 48 hours
the bloat will split it open so clean...

47
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:28,258
...it's just about surgical.

48
00:04:28,426 --> 00:04:31,941
The bodily fluids fall down
into the ground, get soaked up...

49
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,336
...because that's what gravity does.

50
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:37,543
But, hey, it could be Satan.

51
00:04:37,706 --> 00:04:40,743
What newspaper
did you say you work for?

52
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:44,616
<i>-World Weekly News.
-Weekly World News.</i>

53
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:45,979
<i>-World--
-Weekly World.</i>

54
00:04:46,145 --> 00:04:47,499
<i>World-- I'm new.</i>

55
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:52,058
Get out of my office.

56
00:05:00,226 --> 00:05:01,579
-John.
-Jeff.

57
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:03,377
Jeff, I know that.

58
00:05:03,545 --> 00:05:05,501
Dr. Dworkin needs to see you
in his office.

59
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:07,179
But Dr. Dworkin's on vacation.

60
00:05:07,346 --> 00:05:09,734
He's back and he's pissed.
He's screaming for you.

61
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:11,657
-So if I were you, I would:
-Okay.

62
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:13,305
Okay.

63
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:19,304
Those Satanists in Florida,
they marked their victims?

64
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,979
-Yeah. Reverse pentacle on the forehead.
-Yeah.

65
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:24,819
So much F'd up crap happens in Florida.

66
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:32,138
All right, open it.

67
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,859
You open it.

68
00:05:35,105 --> 00:05:36,299
You wuss.

69
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,260
Well, no pentagram.

70
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:49,539
-Poor girl.
-Maybe we should look in her mouth.

71
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:52,173
See if those wackos
stuffed anything down her throat.

72
00:05:52,345 --> 00:05:55,461
<i>You know, kind of like the moth
in Silence of the Lambs.</i>

73
00:05:55,664 --> 00:05:58,303
-Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
-No, you go ahead.

74
00:05:58,865 --> 00:06:01,253
-What?
-Put the lotion in the basket.

75
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:03,861
Right, yeah, I'm the wuss, huh?

76
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,383
Whatever.

77
00:06:12,265 --> 00:06:14,095
-Dean, get me a bucket.
-Find something?

78
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:15,657
No, I'm gonna puke.

79
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:21,938
-Wait, lift her lip up again.
-What?

80
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,336
-You want me to throw up.
-No, no, no. I think I saw something.

81
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:31,255
What is that, a hole?

82
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:34,860
-It's a tooth.
-Sam, that's a fang.

83
00:06:37,503 --> 00:06:40,416
A retractable set of vampire fangs.
You gotta be kidding me.

84
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:41,811
Well, this changes things.

85
00:06:42,343 --> 00:06:43,492
You think?

86
00:07:09,543 --> 00:07:11,898
-How's it going?
-Living the dream.

87
00:07:12,063 --> 00:07:14,736
-What can I get for you?
-Two beers, please.

88
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:17,620
So we're looking for some people.

89
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:20,971
Sure. It's hard to be lonely.

90
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:26,696
Yeah, but that's not what I meant.

91
00:07:33,343 --> 00:07:36,573
Great, so these people, they would've
moved here about six months ago.

92
00:07:36,742 --> 00:07:40,132
-Probably pretty rowdy, like to drink.
-Yeah, real night owls, you know?

93
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:41,815
Sleep all day, party all night.

94
00:07:42,022 --> 00:07:45,254
Barker Farm got leased out
a couple months ago. Real winners.

95
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,971
They've been in here a lot.
Drinkers. Noisy.

96
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:51,179
I've had to eighty-six them
once or twice.

97
00:07:54,262 --> 00:07:55,775
Thanks.

98
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:08,540
-Smile.
-What?

99
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:11,010
-Show us those pearly whites.
-For the love of--

100
00:09:11,181 --> 00:09:14,456
You wanna stick that thing
someplace else? I'm not a vampire.

101
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:17,058
Yeah, that's right. I heard you guys.

102
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:19,688
-What do you know about vampires?
-How to kill them.

103
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,773
Now, seriously, bro,
that knife's making me itch.

104
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,408
-Hey.
-Whoa, easy there, Chachi.

105
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:38,096
See? Fangless. Happy?

106
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:44,413
Now, who the hell are you?

107
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,210
Sam and Dean Winchester.

108
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,974
I can't believe it.

109
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,779
I met your old man once.
Hell of a guy. Great hunter.

110
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,700
I heard he passed. I'm sorry.

111
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,094
That's big shoes.

112
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,139
But from what I hear, you guys fill them.
Great trackers. Good in a tight spot.

113
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,972
-Seem to know a lot about our family.
-Word travels fast.

114
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,694
-You know how hunters talk.
-No, we don't, actually.

115
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,249
I guess there's a lot
your dad never told you, huh?

116
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:13,974
So... .

117
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,217
So those two vampires,
they were yours.

118
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:19,176
Yup. Been here two weeks.

119
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:22,093
-Check out that farm?
-A bust. A bunch of hippie freaks.

120
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,494
They could kill you
with that patchouli smell.

121
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,251
Where's the nest, then?

122
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,810
I got this one covered.

123
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:32,533
Don't get me wrong,
it's a real pleasure meeting you.

124
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:34,934
But I've been on this thing
for over a year.

125
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:38,011
I killed a fang back in Austin,
tracked the nest here.

126
00:10:38,219 --> 00:10:39,447
I'll finish it.

127
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,818
-We could help.
-Thanks.

128
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:44,539
But I'm a go-it-alone type of guy.

129
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:46,576
Come on, I've been itching for a hunt.

130
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:50,015
Sorry. But, hey, I hear there's
a chupacabra two states over.

131
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:51,771
Go ahead and knock yourselves out.

132
00:10:57,579 --> 00:10:59,774
It was real good meeting you, though.

133
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:01,736
I'll buy you a drink on the flip side.

134
00:13:35,016 --> 00:13:39,055
So I guess I gotta buy you that drink.

135
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,288
Here you go.

136
00:13:57,656 --> 00:13:59,486
-No, no, I got it.
-Come on.

137
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:01,532
I insist.

138
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:04,535
-Thank you, sweetie.
-You're welcome. Thanks.

139
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:08,888
-Another one bites the dust.
-That's right.

140
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:16,653
Dean...

141
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,807
...you gave that big-ass fang
one hell of a haircut, my friend.

142
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:23,773
-Thank you.
-That was beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

143
00:14:23,935 --> 00:14:26,813
-Well. You all right, Sammy?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

144
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:30,604
-Well, lighten up a little, Sammy.
-He's the one who gets to call me that.

145
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:34,483
Okay. No offense meant.
Just celebrating a little. Job well done.

146
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:39,808
Right, well, decapitations
aren't my idea of a good time, I guess.

147
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:42,205
Oh, come on, man.
It's not like it was human.

148
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:46,003
-You gotta have fun with your job.
-That's what I've been trying to tell him.

149
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:48,404
You could learn a thing or two
from this guy.

150
00:14:52,214 --> 00:14:53,567
Yeah, I bet I could.

151
00:14:53,734 --> 00:14:55,726
Look, I'm not gonna
bring you guys down.

152
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,566
I'm just gonna go back to the motel.

153
00:14:57,734 --> 00:14:58,928
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

154
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:03,533
Sammy.

155
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:08,327
Remind me to beat that buzz kill
out of you later, all right?

156
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,645
-Something I said?
-No, he just gets that way sometimes.

157
00:15:15,534 --> 00:15:16,523
Tell you what...

158
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,842
...match quarters for the next round.

159
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:40,246
So I pick up this crossbow,
and I hit that ugly sucker...

160
00:15:40,413 --> 00:15:42,882
...with a silver-tipped arrow
right in his heart.

161
00:15:43,614 --> 00:15:45,012
<i>Sammy's waiting in the car...</i>

162
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:47,768
...and me and my dad
take the thing into the woods...

163
00:15:47,934 --> 00:15:49,128
...and burn it to a crisp.

164
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:53,767
I'm sitting there and I'm looking
into the fire and I'm thinking to myself:

165
00:15:54,134 --> 00:15:56,203
"I'm 1 6 years old.

166
00:15:56,653 --> 00:16:00,567
Kids my age are worried about pimples,
prom dates.

167
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:03,327
I'm seeing things
that they'll never even know.

168
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:05,688
Never even dream of. "

169
00:16:07,653 --> 00:16:10,850
-So right then, I just sort of--
-Embraced the life?

170
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:14,169
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

171
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:17,206
Yeah.

172
00:16:17,973 --> 00:16:18,961
How'd you get started?

173
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:21,772
First time I saw a vampire,
I was barely 18.

174
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:23,645
Home alone with my sister.

175
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:27,442
I hear the window break in her room.

176
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:30,570
I grab my dad's gun, run in.
Try to get it off her.

177
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:32,006
It was too late.

178
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:33,852
So I shoot the damn thing...

179
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:37,004
...which is about as useful
as snapping it with a rubber band.

180
00:16:37,772 --> 00:16:41,004
It rushes me, picks me up,
flings me across the room...

181
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:42,764
...knocks me out cold.

182
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:43,921
When I wake up...

183
00:16:44,812 --> 00:16:46,963
<i>...the vampire's gone...</i>

184
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:48,724
...my sister is gone.

185
00:16:48,932 --> 00:16:50,251
And then?

186
00:16:50,452 --> 00:16:52,283
Then... .

187
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:56,048
Try explaining that one
to your family.

188
00:16:57,612 --> 00:16:59,569
So I left home.

189
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:03,084
And then bummed around,
looking for information.

190
00:17:03,252 --> 00:17:05,971
How you track them,
how you kill them.

191
00:17:06,932 --> 00:17:09,321
And I found that fang.

192
00:17:09,492 --> 00:17:12,085
It was my first kill.

193
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,884
Sorry about your sister.

194
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:16,810
Yeah.

195
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,089
She was beautiful.

196
00:17:19,252 --> 00:17:22,881
I can still see her, you know?
The way she was.

197
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:30,046
But, hey, that was a long time ago.

198
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:33,006
I mean, your dad.

199
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:34,605
It's gotta be rough.

200
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:36,204
Yeah.

201
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah, you know,
he was just one of those guys.

202
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:43,322
Took some terrible beatings...

203
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:45,448
...and just kept coming.

204
00:17:45,612 --> 00:17:47,920
So you're always saying to yourself,
you know:

205
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:50,890
"He's indestructible.
He'll be always around.

206
00:17:51,051 --> 00:17:53,281
Nothing can kill my dad. "

207
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,327
And just like that:

208
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,005
He's gone.

209
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,360
I can't talk about this to Sammy.

210
00:18:08,531 --> 00:18:11,169
You know, I gotta keep
my game face on.

211
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:17,083
But the truth is,
I'm not handling it very well.

212
00:18:20,051 --> 00:18:23,326
-Feel like I have this--
-Hole inside you?

213
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,724
And it just gets bigger and bigger
and darker and darker?

214
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,806
Good. You can use it.

215
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,682
Keeps you hungry.

216
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,480
Trust me, there's plenty out there
needs killing and this'll help you do it.

217
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:41,484
Dean, It's not a crime to need your job.

218
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,328
-Harvelle's Roadhouse.
-Hey, Ellen, Sam Winchester.

219
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,606
Sam, it's good to hear from you.

220
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,807
<i>-You boys are okay, aren't you?
-Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.</i>

221
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,801
-Got a question.
-Yeah, shoot.

222
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,119
You ever run across a guy
named Gordon Walker?

223
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:03,882
-Yeah, I know Gordon.
-And?

224
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,881
<i>He's a real good hunter.
Why you asking?</i>

225
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,007
<i>We ran into him on a job
and we're kind of working with him.</i>

226
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:10,159
Don't do that, Sam.

227
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,200
I thought you said
he was a good hunter.

228
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:16,280
And Hannibal Lecter's
a good psychiatrist.

229
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:19,248
Look, he is dangerous to everyone
and everything around him.

230
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,843
lf he's working on a job,
let him handle it, move on.

231
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:23,238
<i>-Ellen--
-No, Sam.</i>

232
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,207
<i>You just listen to what I'm telling you,
okay?</i>

233
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:28,598
Right, okay.

234
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,444
Know why I love this life?

235
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:35,245
It's all black and white.
There's no maybe.

236
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:37,400
You find the bad thing, kill it.

237
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:41,598
See most people spend their lives
in shades of gray.

238
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:45,159
ls this right, is that wrong? Not us.

239
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:47,684
I'm not sure Sammy would agree
with you, but... .

240
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:50,568
Doesn't seem like your brother's
much like us.

241
00:19:51,209 --> 00:19:54,007
I'm not saying he's wrong,
just different.

242
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:56,683
You and me, we were born to do this.

243
00:19:56,849 --> 00:19:58,646
It's in our blood.

244
00:21:50,927 --> 00:21:52,405
Wait.

245
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:54,205
Step back, Eli.

246
00:22:01,327 --> 00:22:04,204
My name's Lenore. I'm not gonna
hurt you. We just need to talk.

247
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,715
Talk? Yeah, okay.
But I might have a tough time...

248
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:09,081
...paying attention
to much besides Eli's teeth.

249
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:11,077
He won't hurt you.
You have my word.

250
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,998
Your word? Oh, yeah, great. Thanks.

251
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,634
No offense, but you're not
the first vampire I've met.

252
00:22:15,806 --> 00:22:18,081
We're not like the others.
We don't kill humans.

253
00:22:18,246 --> 00:22:20,760
We don't drink their blood.
We haven't for a long time.

254
00:22:20,926 --> 00:22:23,884
-What is this, some kind of joke?
-Notice you're still alive.

255
00:22:27,286 --> 00:22:30,801
Okay, correct me if I'm wrong here,
but shouldn't you be starving to death?

256
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:33,434
We've found other ways: cattle blood.

257
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:37,883
-You're responsible for all the--?
-It's not ideal. ln fact, it's disgusting.

258
00:22:38,045 --> 00:22:39,559
But allows us to get by.

259
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:42,923
-Okay, why?
-Survival.

260
00:22:43,086 --> 00:22:44,996
No deaths, no missing locals...

261
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:48,875
...no reason for people like you
to come looking for people like us.

262
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,359
We blend in.

263
00:22:51,085 --> 00:22:53,156
Our kind is practically extinct.

264
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:56,158
Turns out we weren't as high up
the food chain as we imagined.

265
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:58,475
Why are we explaining ourselves
to this killer?

266
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:00,364
<i>-Eli.
-We choke on cow's blood...</i>

267
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:02,117
...so that none of them suffer?

268
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:04,520
Tonight, they murdered Conrad
and celebrated.

269
00:23:04,685 --> 00:23:07,324
-Eli, That's enough.
-Yeah, Eli, that's enough.

270
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:10,079
What's done is done.

271
00:23:10,245 --> 00:23:12,680
-We're leaving this town.
-Why did you bring me here?

272
00:23:12,845 --> 00:23:15,962
-Why are you even talking to me?
-Believe me, l'd rather not.

273
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:19,322
I know your kind. Once you have
the scent, you'll keep tracking us.

274
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:22,158
It doesn't matter where we go.
Hunters will find us.

275
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:24,963
-You're asking us not to follow?
-We have a right to live.

276
00:23:25,124 --> 00:23:27,480
-We're not hurting anyone.
-Right, you keep saying.

277
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:30,477
But give me one good reason
why I should believe you.

278
00:23:33,005 --> 00:23:34,677
Fine.

279
00:23:35,525 --> 00:23:36,923
You know what I'm going to do?

280
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,882
I'm going to let you go.

281
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,479
Take him back. Not a mark on him.

282
00:24:16,084 --> 00:24:20,077
This is the best pattern I can establish.
It's sketchy at best.

283
00:24:20,244 --> 00:24:24,157
It's all coming from this side of town.
The nest would be around here, right?

284
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:25,996
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

285
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:29,439
Problem is there's 35, 40 farms
out there.

286
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:32,641
I've searched about half of them already,
but nothing yet.

287
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,396
Covering their tracks real good.

288
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:37,243
Well, I guess we'll just
have to search the other half.

289
00:24:39,364 --> 00:24:41,593
What time is it? Where is Sam?

290
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:44,961
Car's parked outside.
Probably went for a walk.

291
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,839
-Seems like the take-a-walk type.
-Yeah, he is, but--

292
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:55,360
-Where you been?
-Can I talk to you alone?

293
00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:58,512
You mind chilling out
for a couple minutes?

294
00:25:03,363 --> 00:25:05,001
Maybe we gotta rethink this hunt.

295
00:25:05,163 --> 00:25:07,916
What are you talking about?
Where were you?

296
00:25:08,843 --> 00:25:10,913
-ln the nest.
-You found it?

297
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,994
They found me, man.

298
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:15,960
How'd you get out?
How many did you kill?

299
00:25:16,122 --> 00:25:17,112
None.

300
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:20,002
-They didn't just let you go.
-That's what they did.

301
00:25:20,163 --> 00:25:23,473
-All right, well, where is it?
-I was blindfolded. I don't know.

302
00:25:23,683 --> 00:25:25,992
-Gotta know something.
-We went over that bridge.

303
00:25:26,163 --> 00:25:28,392
-But maybe we shouldn't go after them.
-Why not?

304
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:30,992
I don't think they're killing people.

305
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:32,642
You're joking.

306
00:25:33,442 --> 00:25:36,515
Then how do they stay alive or undead,
whatever the hell they are?

307
00:25:36,683 --> 00:25:39,560
The cattle mutilations.
They live off of animal blood.

308
00:25:39,722 --> 00:25:43,033
-And you believed them?
-Look at me, Dean.

309
00:25:43,203 --> 00:25:44,794
They let me go without a scratch.

310
00:25:45,322 --> 00:25:46,994
Wait, so you're saying--?

311
00:25:48,002 --> 00:25:50,516
No, man. No way.
I don't know why they let you go.

312
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,560
I don't really care.
We find them and we waste them.

313
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:55,280
Why?

314
00:25:56,162 --> 00:25:58,278
What part of "vampires"
don't you understand?

315
00:25:58,442 --> 00:26:00,751
If it's supernatural, we kill it.
That's our job.

316
00:26:00,922 --> 00:26:03,516
No, Dean, that is not our job.
Our job is hunting evil.

317
00:26:03,682 --> 00:26:06,071
lf these things aren't killing,
they're not evil.

318
00:26:06,242 --> 00:26:07,879
Of course they're killing people.

319
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:10,431
They're all the same, Sam.
They're not human, okay?

320
00:26:10,642 --> 00:26:11,961
We have to exterminate them.

321
00:26:12,122 --> 00:26:14,840
No, Dean. I don't think so, all right?
Not this time.

322
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:16,833
Gordon's been on those vamps
for a year.

323
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,601
-Gordon? You're taking his word for it?
-That's right.

324
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:21,160
Ellen says he's bad news.

325
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:23,076
You called Ellen?

326
00:26:23,242 --> 00:26:25,675
And I'm supposed to listen to her?
We barely know her.

327
00:26:25,841 --> 00:26:29,152
-No, thanks. I'll go with Gordon.
-Because Gordon's such an old friend.

328
00:26:30,242 --> 00:26:32,152
-You think I can't see what this is?
-What?

329
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:35,359
-He's a substitute for Dad. A poor one.
-Shut up, Sam.

330
00:26:35,562 --> 00:26:37,870
He's not even close, Dean.
Not on his best day.

331
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:40,595
-I'm not gonna talk--
-You slap on this fake smile...

332
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:43,036
...but I can see through it.
I know how you feel.

333
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:46,876
Dad's dead, and he left a hole
and it hurts so bad you can't take it.

334
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,874
But you can't just fill that hole
with whoever you want to.

335
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,838
It's an insult to his memory.

336
00:26:53,841 --> 00:26:55,035
Okay.

337
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:08,229
You hit me all you want.
It won't change anything.

338
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:09,516
I'm going to that nest.

339
00:27:09,681 --> 00:27:13,355
You don't wanna tell me where it is,
fine. I'll find it myself.

340
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:19,356
Dean.

341
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:23,638
Gordon?

342
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,472
-You think he went after them?
-Probably.

343
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:30,438
-We have to stop him.
-Really? Because I say we lend a hand.

344
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,838
Just give me the benefit of the doubt,
would you? You owe me that.

345
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:36,594
Yeah, we'll see.
I'll drive. Give me the keys.

346
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,912
He snaked the keys.

347
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,877
I can't believe this.

348
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,032
I just fixed her up too.

349
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,392
The bridge, is that all you got?

350
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,154
The bridge was four and a half minutes
from their farm.

351
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,198
-How do you know?
-I counted.

352
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,234
They took a left out of the farm,
then turned right onto a dirt road.

353
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,550
Followed that for two minutes,
slightly uphill.

354
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,154
Then took another quick right
and we hit the bridge.

355
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,037
You're good.

356
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,718
A monster pain in the ass...

357
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,868
...but you're good.

358
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:30,708
-ln the truck, thank you.
-We can't leave like this.

359
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,468
Lenore, listen to me.
We need to stay and fight.

360
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,670
They were my friends, too, Eli.
My family.

361
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:40,713
That's not what I'm talking about.
This is self-defense. Kill or be killed.

362
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:42,676
They can't hunt us if they're dead.

363
00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:45,597
Killing those three
wouldn't solve anything.

364
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:48,956
There's more where they came from.
We're outnumbered.

365
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,429
This is all we can do.

366
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:55,636
-Try and reason with--
-You can't reason with these people.

367
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,392
They're gonna kill us all anyway.

368
00:28:58,758 --> 00:29:01,148
We should at least
take a few of them with us.

369
00:29:04,238 --> 00:29:06,355
I'm not giving up hope.

370
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,914
lf we can change they can change.

371
00:29:11,078 --> 00:29:13,673
Now, go into town
and gather the others.

372
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,590
We leave before sunrise.

373
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,426
Dead man's blood, bitch.

374
00:31:21,356 --> 00:31:24,393
-Sam, Dean, come on in.
-Hey, Gordon, what's going on?

375
00:31:24,556 --> 00:31:27,195
Just poisoning Lenore here
with some dead man's blood.

376
00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:29,426
She's gonna tell us
where all her friends are.

377
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:31,230
-Wanna help?
-Look, man--

378
00:31:31,396 --> 00:31:32,795
Grab a knife.

379
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,824
I was just about to start in
on the fingers.

380
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:44,675
Whoa, hey, let's all just chill out, huh?

381
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,224
-I'm completely chill.
-Gordon, put the knife down.

382
00:31:47,395 --> 00:31:49,387
Sounds like it's Sammy
that needs to chill.

383
00:31:49,596 --> 00:31:51,746
Just step away from her, all right?

384
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:58,514
You're right.

385
00:31:59,635 --> 00:32:01,148
I'm wasting my time here.

386
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:03,711
This bitch'll never talk.

387
00:32:04,595 --> 00:32:06,904
Might as well put her
out of her misery.

388
00:32:07,315 --> 00:32:10,193
I just sharpened it
so it's completely humane.

389
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:13,910
-Gordon, I'm letting her go.
-You're not doing a damn thing.

390
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:17,027
Hey, hey, hey.
Gordon, let's talk about this.

391
00:32:17,195 --> 00:32:20,824
What's there to talk about?
It's like I said, Dean, no shades of gray.

392
00:32:20,994 --> 00:32:23,190
Yeah, I hear you.

393
00:32:23,355 --> 00:32:25,107
-And I know how you feel.
-Do you?

394
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:28,472
The vampire that killed your sister
deserved to die. But this--

395
00:32:29,995 --> 00:32:31,508
Killed my sister?

396
00:32:31,955 --> 00:32:35,504
That filthy fang didn't kill my sister.
It turned her.

397
00:32:35,675 --> 00:32:36,869
Made her one of them.

398
00:32:37,675 --> 00:32:40,950
So I hunted her down
and I killed her myself.

399
00:32:42,035 --> 00:32:43,991
-You did what?
-Wasn't my sister anymore.

400
00:32:44,155 --> 00:32:47,146
It wasn't human. I didn't blink.

401
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:50,149
-Neither would you.
-So you knew all along then?

402
00:32:50,314 --> 00:32:53,272
You knew about the vampires.
They weren't killing anyone.

403
00:32:53,434 --> 00:32:55,710
You knew about the cattle
and just didn't care.

404
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,193
Care about what?

405
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:59,544
A nest of vampires
suddenly acting nice?

406
00:32:59,714 --> 00:33:01,864
Taking a little time-out
from sucking people...

407
00:33:02,034 --> 00:33:05,583
...and we're supposed to buy that?
Trust me.

408
00:33:06,354 --> 00:33:08,504
Doesn't change what they are.

409
00:33:09,514 --> 00:33:10,503
And I can prove it.

410
00:33:15,074 --> 00:33:16,393
Let him go.

411
00:33:18,394 --> 00:33:20,065
-Now!
-Relax.

412
00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:22,987
lf I wanted to kill him,
he'd already be on the floor.

413
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,230
Just making a little point.

414
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,832
Hey.

415
00:33:39,993 --> 00:33:41,666
You think she's so different?

416
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:45,823
Still wanna save her? Look at her.

417
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:50,946
They're all the same.

418
00:33:51,473 --> 00:33:54,113
Evil, bloodthirsty.

419
00:33:59,153 --> 00:34:02,270
No. No.

420
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:05,191
You hear her, Gordon?

421
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:08,426
No. No.

422
00:34:13,873 --> 00:34:15,670
We're done here.

423
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,104
-Sam, get her out of here.
-Yeah.

424
00:34:19,513 --> 00:34:20,832
I've got you.

425
00:34:24,992 --> 00:34:26,472
Gordon...

426
00:34:27,393 --> 00:34:29,986
...I think you and I got some things
to talk about.

427
00:34:42,992 --> 00:34:44,664
Get out of my way.

428
00:34:45,192 --> 00:34:47,069
-Sorry.
-You're not serious.

429
00:34:49,912 --> 00:34:52,507
Having a hard time believing it,
but I know what I saw.

430
00:34:52,672 --> 00:34:55,391
lf you want those vampires,
you gotta go through me.

431
00:35:02,672 --> 00:35:04,263
Fine.

432
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:26,864
What are you doing, man?
You're doing this for a fang?

433
00:35:27,232 --> 00:35:29,347
Come on, Dean.
We're on the same side here.

434
00:35:29,511 --> 00:35:31,867
I don't think so, you sadistic bastard.

435
00:35:36,631 --> 00:35:40,704
You're not like your brother.
You're a killer. Like me.

436
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:06,140
Oh, sorry.

437
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,703
You know...

438
00:36:10,871 --> 00:36:13,066
...I might be like you...

439
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:15,107
...and I might not.

440
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,984
But you're the one tied up right now.

441
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,507
I miss anything?

442
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,421
Not much.

443
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:10,818
-Lenore get out okay?
-Yeah.

444
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,701
All of them did.

445
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:17,222
Then I guess our work here is done.

446
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:21,381
How you doing, Gordy?

447
00:37:22,189 --> 00:37:23,589
You gotta tinkle yet?

448
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,667
All right.

449
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,507
Well, get comfy.

450
00:37:27,669 --> 00:37:32,106
We'll call someone in two or three days,
have them come out, untie you.

451
00:37:34,029 --> 00:37:35,668
Ready to go, Dean?

452
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:37,778
Not yet.

453
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:45,382
I guess this is goodbye.

454
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:49,259
Well, it's been real.

455
00:37:59,828 --> 00:38:03,105
Okay. I'm good now.

456
00:38:03,509 --> 00:38:05,146
We can go.

457
00:38:17,788 --> 00:38:20,063
-Sam.
-Yeah?

458
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,267
Clock me one.

459
00:38:22,908 --> 00:38:24,136
-What?
-Come on. Come on.

460
00:38:24,308 --> 00:38:26,776
I won't even hit you back. Let's go.

461
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,542
No.

462
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:32,381
Let's go. You get a freebie.
Hit me. Come on.

463
00:38:32,548 --> 00:38:36,018
You look like you just went 1 2 rounds
with a block of cement, Dean.

464
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,019
I'll take a rain check.

465
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:44,178
I wish we never took this job.
It's jacked everything up.

466
00:38:45,228 --> 00:38:46,626
What do you mean?

467
00:38:49,308 --> 00:38:51,696
Think about the hunts we went on,
our whole lives.

468
00:38:51,907 --> 00:38:53,545
-Okay.
-What if we killed things...

469
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:56,745
...that didn't deserve killing?
I mean, the way Dad raised us--

470
00:38:56,948 --> 00:38:59,302
Dean, after what happened to Mom...

471
00:39:00,788 --> 00:39:03,665
-...Dad did the best he could.
-I know he did.

472
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:06,585
But the man wasn't perfect.

473
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:08,864
And the way he raised us
to hate those things?

474
00:39:09,068 --> 00:39:12,343
And, man, I hate them. I do.
When I killed that vampire at the mill...

475
00:39:12,507 --> 00:39:15,658
...I didn't even think about it.
Hell, I even enjoyed it.

476
00:39:18,027 --> 00:39:19,221
You didn't kill Lenore.

477
00:39:19,947 --> 00:39:23,337
Well, but every instinct told me to.
I was gonna kill her, kill them all.

478
00:39:23,507 --> 00:39:24,940
Yeah, Dean, but you didn't.

479
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:26,946
And that's what matters.

480
00:39:30,307 --> 00:39:31,296
Yeah.

481
00:39:35,027 --> 00:39:37,382
And because you're a pain in my ass.

482
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:42,744
I guess I might have to stick around
and be a pain in the ass, then.

483
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,545
Thanks.

484
00:39:46,987 --> 00:39:48,386
Don't mention it.
