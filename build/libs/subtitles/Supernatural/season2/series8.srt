1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,120
Dad wants us to pick
up where he left off.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,280
Saving people, hunting things.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,520
The family business.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,560
You're planning on bringing
the demon here, aren't you?

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,800
Having some stupid, macho showdown?!

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,080
I have a plan, Sam.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,360
Dean is dying, and you have a plan!

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,600
I won't hunt this demon,

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,680
Not until we know Dean's okay.

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,040
Did you really think you could trap me?

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,280
Oh, I don't want to trap
you. I want to make a deal.

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,120
I will give you the colt and the bullet,

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,440
But you got to help Dean.

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,720
You got to bring him back.

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,160
You still need to sweeten the pot.

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,680
Giving to Salomon, these protective
circles, they really work.

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,600
You get a demon in one,
they're trapped, powerless.

18
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,760
What's going on? Oh, my god.

19
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,120
Get a doctor.

20
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,440
Run!

21
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,160
What happened?

22
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,640
Talk to me. Dogs.

23
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,360
Stay with us, baby! Dogs... Black dogs.

24
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,400
Robert?

25
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,680
Robert, don't you die on me!

26
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,700
So much for our low profile.

27
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,900
You got a warrant in St. Louis, and now
you're officially in the feds' database.

28
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,340
Dude, I'm like Dillinger or
something. Dean, it's not funny.

29
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,580
It makes the job harder. We
got to be more careful now.

30
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,660
What do they got on you?

31
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,060
I'm sure they just

32
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,500
Haven't posted it yet.
Well, you're no accessory,

33
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,780
Nothing? Shut up.

34
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,340
You're jealous. No, I'm not!

35
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,060
Uh-Huh.

36
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,620
All right,

37
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,500
What do you got on the case there,
you innocent, harmless young man, you?

38
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,340
"Architect Sean Boyden plummeted to
his death from the roof of his home,

39
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,980
A condominium he designed"

40
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,900
Build a high rise and
jump off. That's classy.

41
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,420
When did he call animal control?

42
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,460
Two days earlier.

43
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,180
Did he actually say "black dog"? Yeah.

44
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,420
"Vicious, wild, black dog"

45
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,340
The authorities couldn't find
it, and no one else saw it.

46
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,660
In fact, the authorities are a
little confused as to how a wild dog

47
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,900
Could get past the doorman,

48
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,100
Take the elevator up, and start roaming
the halls of the cushiest joint in town.

49
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,180
After that, no more calls.
He doesn't show up for work.

50
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,100
Two days later, he takes a swan dive.

51
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,940
You think we're dealing
with an actual black dog?

52
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,140
Well, maybe. What's the lore on it?

53
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,420
It's all pretty vague.

54
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,940
There are spectral black
dogs all over the world, but

55
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,620
Some say they're animal
spirits, others say death omens.

56
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,060
But anyways, whatever they are, they're

57
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,580
Big, nasty...

58
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,780
Yeah, bet they could hump
the crap out of your leg.

59
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,900
Look at that one. Huh?

60
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,580
What? They could.

61
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,500
So,

62
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,380
You and Sean Boyden were
business partners for

63
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,220
Almost 10 years, right?

64
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,420
That's right.

65
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,940
Now, one more time, this is
for... A tribute for Mr. Boyden,

66
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,140
"Architectural Digest".

67
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,740
Funny to you? No,

68
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,540
It's just uh

69
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,820
"Tribute".

70
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,620
Yeah.

71
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,660
See, Sean always got the tributes.

72
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,220
He kills himself,

73
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,500
Leaves me and his family behind,

74
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,420
But he gets another tribute.

75
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,340
Right.

76
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,260
Any idea why he'd do such a thing?

77
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,020
I have no clue. I mean,
he lived a charmed life.

78
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,300
How so?

79
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,220
He was a flat-Out genius.

80
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,700
I mean, I'm capable,
but, next to him, uh...

81
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,660
It wasn't always that way either.

82
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,620
No?

83
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,380
You  want to know the truth?

84
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,980
There was a time where he
couldn't even design a pup tent.

85
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,020
Hell, 10 years ago, he was working
as a bartender at this place called

86
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,100
Lloyd's,

87
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,420
A complete dive.

88
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,340
So, what changed? You got me.

89
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,500
But overnight

90
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,340
He gets this huge commission,

91
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,820
And he starts designing...

92
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,580
He starts designing the most

93
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,100
Ingenious buildings

94
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,140
Anyone has ever seen. It was like

95
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,860
The level of Van Gogh and Mozart.

96
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,500
What?

97
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,660
It's funny.

98
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,020
True geniuses, they...

99
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,020
Seem to die young, don't they?

100
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,100
To have

101
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,180
That kind of talent...

102
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,340
Why...

103
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,140
Why just throw it away?

104
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,820
So?

105
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,780
The secretary's name is Carly.

106
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,060
She's 23. She kayaks...

107
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,140
And they're real.

108
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,220
You didn't happen to ask her if she's
seen any black dogs lately, did you?

109
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,660
Every complain called in this week

110
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,740
About anything big, black, or
dog like. There's 19 calls in all,

111
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,860
And, uh,

112
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,180
I don't know what this is.

113
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,140
You mean, Carly's my space address?

114
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,420
Yeah, my space. What the hell is that?

115
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,940
Seriously, is that like
some sort of porn site?

116
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,620
I swear, if this is
another freakin' pomeranian

117
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,300
Barking in the neighbor's yard...

118
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,180
Afternoon, ma'am.

119
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,780
Animal control.

120
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,140
Oh, someone already came yesterday.

121
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,340
Oh, we're just following up.

122
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,540
We're looking for Dr. Sylvia Perlman.

123
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,900
The  doctor,

124
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,020
Well, she...

125
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,060
I don't know exactly when she'll
be back. She left two days ago.

126
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,900
Okay.

127
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,820
And you are?

128
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,900
I'm Miss Perlman's maid.

129
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,100
So, where did the doctor go?

130
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,940
I'm not sure.

131
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,340
She just packed and went.
She didn't say where.

132
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,380
That stray dog, did you find it finally?

133
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,780
Uh, not yet.

134
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,780
You know,

135
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,260
You didn't ever happen to
see the dog yourself, did you?

136
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,140
Well, no. I never even heard it.

137
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,060
I was almost starting to think the
doctor was imagining things, but

138
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,740
She's not like that, so...
You know, I read she was

139
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,340
The chief surgeon at the hospital.

140
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,620
So she's got to be, what, 42, 43?
That's pretty young for that job.

141
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,060
Youngest in the history of the place.

142
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,220
She got the position 10 years ago.

143
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,660
An overnight success, 10 years ago.

144
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,220
Yeah, we know a guy like that.

145
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,500
Oh, look at this.

146
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,980
Lloyd's bar.

147
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,780
Miss Perlman?

148
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,980
I've been calling for hours!

149
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,220
You need to vacate the room,
or you got to pay for the night!

150
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,900
Okay,

151
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,980
No problem.

152
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,140
H ey.

153
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,620
Yeah?

154
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,460
That's weird.

155
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,020
What? Think someone planted these?

156
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,980
In the middle of all these weeds?

157
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,740
These are, uh, what do you call them?

158
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,060
Yarrow flowers? Yeah.

159
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,740
Used for certain rituals, aren't they?

160
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,300
Yeah, actually, summoning rituals.

161
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,860
So,

162
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,340
Two people become sudden
successes about 10 years ago,

163
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,380
Right around the time they were
hanging out here at Lloyd's.

164
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,180
Where there just happens
to be a crossroads.

165
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,700
You think? Let's find out.

166
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,780
Seem about the dead center to you?

167
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,700
Yahtzee.

168
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,220
I'd be willing to bet
that's graveyard dirt.

169
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,300
And a black cat bone.
That's serious spellwork.

170
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,340
I mean, that's deep south hoodoo stuff.

171
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,100
Used to summon a demon.

172
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,500
Not just summon one.

173
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,060
Crossroad's where pacts are made.

174
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,620
These people are actually making
deals with the damned thing.

175
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,580
You know, 'cause that always ends good.

176
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,580
They're seeing dogs, all right...

177
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,860
But not black dogs.
They're seeing hellhounds,

178
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,900
Demonic pit bulls.

179
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,860
Whoever this demon is, it's
back and it's collecting.

180
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,340
And that doctor lady,
wherever she's running,

181
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,580
She ain't running fast enough.

182
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,900
Holy...

183
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,300
Holy?

184
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,700
Guess again.

185
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,980
<i>Now save poor bob, if you please</i>

186
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,060
I want to play guitar.

187
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,900
I want you to make me the
best blues man ever lived.

188
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,740
If that's what you want...

189
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,300
So...

190
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,700
How...

191
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,300
Do we shake on it?

192
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,420
So, it's just like the
Robert Johnson legend, right?

193
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,020
I mean, "selling your soul at the
crossroads", that kind of deal?

194
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,460
Except that wasn't a legend.

195
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,820
You know his music.

196
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,020
You don't know Robert Johnson songs?

197
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,820
Sam, there's occult
references all over his lyrics.

198
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,380
I mean, "Crossroad blues,"

199
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,900
"Me and the Devil blues,"

200
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,300
"Hellhound on my Trail"?

201
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,460
Story  goes that he died
choking on his own blood.

202
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,060
He was hallucinating and
muttering about big, evil dogs.

203
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,300
And now it's happening all over again.

204
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,100
Yeah.

205
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,900
We got to find out if anyone else
struck any bargains around here.

206
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,820
Right,

207
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,540
So, we got to clean up
these people's mess for them?

208
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,420
They're not exactly squeaky-Clean.

209
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,180
Nobody put a gun to their head and
forced them to play "let's make a deal".

210
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,900
So, what, we should
just leave them to die?

211
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,500
Somebody goes over Niagara in a barrel,
you gonna jump in to try to save them?

212
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,260
Dean...

213
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,900
All right...

214
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,660
Fine.

215
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,620
Rituals like this, you got to put
your own photo into the mix, right?

216
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,700
So this guy probably summoned the thing.

217
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,540
Let's see if anyone inside knows him...

218
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,420
If he's still alive.

219
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,300
What's this guy's name,
again? George Darrow.

220
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,380
Apparent quite the regular at Lloyd's.

221
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,740
This house probably ain't up
next on "mtv cribs", is it?

222
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,660
Yeah.

223
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,220
So, whatever kind of deal he made...

224
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,500
Wasn't for cash.

225
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,780
Ah, who knows? Maybe his place is
full of babes in princess Leia bikinis.

226
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,460
I'm just saying,

227
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,860
This guy's got one epic bill come due.

228
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,860
Hope at least he asked
for something fun.

229
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,340
Look at that.

230
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,660
What is that, pepper?

231
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,260
Who the hell are you? George Darrow?

232
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,420
I'm not buying anything.
Whoa, looks like

233
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,940
You  went for the wrong shaker, there.

234
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,300
Usually, when you want to keep
something evil out, you go for the salt.

235
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,260
I don't know what you're talking about.

236
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,580
Talking about this.

237
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,380
Tell me...

238
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,900
You seen that hellhound yet?

239
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,300
Look,

240
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,700
We want to help.

241
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,820
Please,

242
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,460
Just 5 minutes.

243
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,860
So, what is that stuff out front?

244
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,460
Goofer dust.

245
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,620
What, you boys think you know something
about something, but not goofer dust?

246
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,860
Well, we know a little
about a lot of things,

247
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,700
Just enough to make us dangerous.

248
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,500
What is it?

249
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,820
Hoodoo.

250
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,220
My grandma taught me.

251
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,100
Keeps out demons.

252
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,500
Demons, we know.

253
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,700
Well, then,

254
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,860
Keep it.

255
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,340
Maybe it'll do you some good.

256
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,300
4 minutes left.

257
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,660
Mr. Darrow...

258
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,220
We know you're in trouble.
Yeah, that you got yourself into.

259
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,740
But it's not hopeless, all right?

260
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,500
There's got to be something we can do.

261
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,340
Listen,

262
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,620
I get that you boys want to help,

263
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,140
But sometimes a person makes their bed
and they just got to lie down in it.

264
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,740
I'm the one called that
demon in the first place.

265
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,100
What'd you do it for? I was weak.

266
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,940
I mean, who don't want to be great?

267
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,900
Who don't want their
life to mean something?

268
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,660
I just...

269
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,180
I just never thought about the price.

270
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,380
Was it worth it?

271
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,540
Hell, no

272
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,140
Course, I asked for talent.

273
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,300
Should have gone for fame.

274
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,380
I'm still broke...

275
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,060
And lonely.

276
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,020
Just now I got this pile of
paintings don't nobody want.

277
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,100
That wasn't the worst.

278
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,620
Go on.

279
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,460
Demon didn't leave.

280
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,260
I never counted on that.

281
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,700
After our deal was done, the damn
thing stayed at Lloyd's for a week,

282
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,140
Just chatting,

283
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,300
Making more deals.

284
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,300
I tried to warn folks, but

285
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,660
Who gonna listen to an old drunk?

286
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,940
How many others are there?

287
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,740
This architect,

288
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,220
A doctor lady. I kept up with
them. They've been in the papers.

289
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,540
At least they got famous.

290
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,260
Who else, George? Come on, think.

291
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,980
Oh, one more.

292
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,980
Uh, nice guy, too.

293
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,420
Hudson,

294
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,300
Evan I think.

295
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,860
I don't know what he asked for.

296
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,540
Don't matter now.

297
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,860
We're done for.

298
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,820
No.

299
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,180
No, there's got to be
a way. You don't get it.

300
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,020
I don't want a way.

301
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,300
Look, you don't... I called that thing!

302
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,220
I brought it on myself!

303
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,140
I brought it on them.

304
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,460
I'm going to hell,

305
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,740
One way or another.

306
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,620
All I want is to
finish my last painting.

307
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,180
Day or two, I'm done.

308
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,020
I'm just trying to
hold him off till then,

309
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,580
Buy a little time.

310
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,980
Okay, boys, time you went. Go
help somebody that wants help.

311
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,900
We can't just... Get out!

312
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,900
I got work to do.

313
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,420
You don't really want to die.

314
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,660
I don't?

315
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,700
I'm tired.

316
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,420
Evan?

317
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,580
Are you spying on the neighbors?

318
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,900
No, I, uh,

319
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,180
I thought I heard something
in the yard, but it's nothing.

320
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,780
You all ready to go?

321
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,460
You know, if I didn't know better, I'd
say that you want me out of the house.

322
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,340
Of course not. It's just, you've...

323
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,940
You've barely seen your
sister since she had the baby.

324
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,460
Well, what are you
going to do all weekend?

325
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,220
Um, not much. I got some bills to pay.

326
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,420
Come here.

327
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,460
I'll miss you.

328
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,500
You better.

329
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,380
You know I love you, right?

330
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,740
Forever.

331
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,580
Of course. Evan, are you okay?

332
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,540
Yeah.

333
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,420
Yeah, I'm fine.

334
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,660
Now, get going.

335
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,420
Okay, I'll call you when I get there.

336
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,780
Hey, sweetie?

337
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,340
I love you, too.

338
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,300
Yes? Evan Hudson?

339
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,020
Yeah.

340
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,780
You ever been to a bar called Lloyd's?

341
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,500
Would have been about 10 years ago.

342
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,420
Come on, we're not demons.

343
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,460
Any other bright ideas?

344
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,040
Evan?

345
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,000
Please!

346
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,520
Don't hurt me.

347
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,720
We're not gonna hurt you, all
right? We're here to help you.

348
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,680
We know all about the
genius deal you made.

349
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,960
What?

350
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,920
How? Doesn't matter.

351
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,880
All that matters is
we're trying to stop it.

352
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,640
How do I know you're not
lying? Well, you don't.

353
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,480
But you're kind of running low
on options, there, buddy boy.

354
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,240
Can you stop it?

355
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,080
Don't know.

356
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,320
We'll try.

357
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,320
I don't wanna die.

358
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,120
Of course you don't. Not now. Dean...

359
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,040
Stop. What'd you ask for, anyway, Ev?

360
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,760
Huh?

361
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,640
Never need viagra, bowl
a perfect game, what?

362
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
My wife.

363
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,680
Right, getting the girl.
That's worth a trip to hell for.

364
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,200
Dean, stop. No.

365
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,640
He's right. I made the deal.

366
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,640
Nobody twisted my arm. That, uh,

367
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,000
Woman,

368
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,000
Or whatever she was, at the bar, she
said I could have anything I wanted.

369
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,920
I thought she was nuts, at first, but...

370
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,400
I don't know. I was...

371
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,640
I was desperate.

372
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,200
Desperate?

373
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,880
Julie  was dying.

374
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,400
You did it to save her?

375
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,720
She had cancer. They
had stopped treatment.

376
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,080
They were moving her into
hospice. They kept saying,

377
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,080
"Matter of days".

378
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,840
So, yeah, I made the deal...

379
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,560
And I'd do it again.

380
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,480
I'd have died for her on the spot.

381
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,400
Did you ever think
about her in all this?

382
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,840
I did this for her.

383
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,000
You sure about that?

384
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,200
I think you did it for yourself...

385
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,000
So you wouldn't have
to live without her.

386
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
But, guess what, she's gonna
have to live without you now.

387
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,640
What if she knew how much it cost?

388
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,640
What if she knew it cost your soul?

389
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,280
How do you think she'd feel?

390
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,200
Okay, that's enough. Evan,

391
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,480
Sit tight, all right?

392
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,800
We're gonna figure this out.

393
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,080
You all right? Why wouldn't I be?

394
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,680
Hey, I got an idea.

395
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,360
You throw George's
hoodoo at that hellhound,

396
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,120
Keep it away from Evan
as long as you can.

397
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,600
I'm gonna go to the crossroads
and summon the demon.

398
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,440
Summon...

399
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,880
Are you nuts?

400
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,720
Maybe a little.

401
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,360
But I can trap it.

402
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,200
I can exorcise it and I can buy us time
to figure out something more permanent.

403
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,480
Yeah, but how much time?
I don't know. A while.

404
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,760
It's not easy for those suckers to claw their
way back from hell and into the sunshine.

405
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,480
No.

406
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,880
No way. Not allowed to say no, Sammy,

407
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,040
Unless you got a better idea.
Dean, you can forget it, all right?

408
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,680
I'm not letting you
summon that demon. Why not?

409
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,600
Because I don't like where your
head is at right now. That's why not.

410
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,320
What are you talking about?
You've been on edge ever since

411
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,400
We found that crossroads,
Dean, and I think I know why.

412
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,240
We don't have time for this. Dad.

413
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,720
You think maybe dad made
one of these deals, huh?

414
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,880
Hell,

415
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,280
I've been thinking it.

416
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,440
I'm sure you've been thinking it, too.

417
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,360
It fits, doesn't it?

418
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,520
I'm alive, dad's dead.

419
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,280
Yellow-Eyed demon was involved.

420
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,400
What if he did?

421
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,080
What if he struck a deal?

422
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,840
My life for his soul.

423
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,240
<i>Hey, guys, I think I
hear it! It's outside!</i>

424
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,960
Just keep him alive, okay?

425
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,520
Dean? Go!

426
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,400
So,

427
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,400
What brings a guy like
you to a place like this?

428
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,160
You called me?

429
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,760
I'm just glad it worked.

430
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,600
First time?

431
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,200
You could say that.

432
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,080
Oh, come on, now.

433
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,240
Don't sell yourself short.

434
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,840
I know all about you, Dean Winchester.

435
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,920
So you know who I am.

436
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,480
I get the newsletter.

437
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,400
Well, don't keep me in suspense.

438
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,000
What have you heard?

439
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,560
Well,

440
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,680
I heard you were handsome.

441
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,720
You're just edible.

442
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,840
What can I do for you, Dean?

443
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,200
Maybe we should do this in my car.

444
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,000
Nice and private.

445
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,720
Sounds good to me.

446
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,960
What is that stuff? Goofer dust.

447
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,320
Are you serious?

448
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,560
Yeah. Afraid so.

449
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,920
Look, believe me, don't
believe me... Whatever you want.

450
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,400
Just whatever you do,

451
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,640
Stay inside this circle, all right?

452
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,000
So, I was hoping we could strike a deal.

453
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,560
That's what I do.

454
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,480
I want Evan Hudson
released from his contract.

455
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,120
So sorry, darling.

456
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,240
That's not negotiable.

457
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,120
I'll make it worth your while.

458
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,800
Oh, really?

459
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,880
What are you offering? Me.

460
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,840
Well, well, well.

461
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,000
You'd sacrifice your
life for someone else's.

462
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,960
Like father, like son.

463
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,320
That's the last of it.

464
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,960
You did know about
your dad's deal, right?

465
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,720
His life for yours.

466
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,840
Oh, I didn't make the deal myself, but,

467
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,160
Boy, I wish I had.

468
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,760
After you.

469
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,360
Such a gentleman.

470
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,000
A devil's trap?

471
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,600
You've got to be kidding me.

472
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,080
What?

473
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,120
You hear that?

474
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,600
No. Where?

475
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,360
Right outside the door.

476
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,640
Just don't move, all right?

477
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,040
Stay where you are.

478
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,300
You stupid, stupid...

479
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,660
I should rip you limb from limb.

480
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,780
Take your best shot.

481
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,500
No,

482
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,460
I don't think so.

483
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,740
I'm not gonna put you
out of your misery.

484
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,620
Yeah? Why not?

485
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,500
'Cause your misery is the whole point.

486
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,460
It's too much fun to watch.

487
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,780
Knowing how your daddy died for you,

488
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,500
How he sold his soul.

489
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,700
I mean,

490
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,140
That's got to hurt.

491
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,500
He's all you ever think about.

492
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,460
You wake up, and your first thought is

493
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,420
"I can't do this anymore".

494
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,540
You're all lit up with pain.

495
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,660
I mean, you loved him so
much. And it's all your fault.

496
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,300
You blew it, Dean.

497
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,180
I could have given you what you need.

498
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,500
What do I need?

499
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,100
Your father.

500
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,340
I could have brought him back.

501
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,940
Your loss.

502
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,660
See ya, Dean.

503
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,940
I wish you a nice, long life.

504
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,180
Hold on.

505
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,140
Do you still hear it?

506
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,620
No.

507
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,020
Is it over?

508
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,540
It's here!

509
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:04,020
You're lucky I've got a soft spot
for lost puppies and long faces.

510
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,620
I just can't leave you like this.

511
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,140
Besides,

512
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,380
You didn't call me here
to bargain for Evan.

513
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,740
Not really.

514
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,300
Can you bring him back?

515
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,180
My dad?

516
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,420
Of course I can,

517
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,140
Just as he was.

518
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,300
Your dad would live
a long, natural life,

519
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,980
Like he was meant to.

520
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,660
That's a promise. What about me?

521
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,540
I could give you 10 years,

522
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,300
10 long, good years with him.

523
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,020
That's a lifetime.

524
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,020
The family could be together again.

525
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,220
John, Dean, Sammy...

526
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,420
The Winchester boys all reunited.

527
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,540
Look,

528
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,780
Your dad is supposed to be alive.

529
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,260
You're supposed to be dead.

530
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,020
So, we'll just set things straight,

531
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,700
Put things back in their natural order,

532
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,380
And you get 10 extra years on top.

533
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,540
That's a bonus.

534
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,100
You think you could...

535
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,900
Throw in a set of steak knives?

536
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,020
You know, this smartass
self-Sefense mechanism of yours...

537
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,180
Dean...

538
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,620
Now you're really trapped.

539
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,420
That's got to hurt.

540
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,900
Let me out now.

541
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,660
Sure.

542
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,100
We just got to make a
little deal here first.

543
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,820
You call off your hellhound

544
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,180
And let Evan go.

545
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,180
Then I'll let you go.

546
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,180
I can't break a binding contract.

547
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,020
And by "can't," you
mean "don't want to"?

548
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,380
Last chance.

549
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,700
Evan and his wife get to
live to a ripe old age.

550
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,300
Going...

551
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,420
Going... Let's talk about this.

552
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,300
Okay, gone.

553
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,660
Stay inside the circle!

554
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,580
Come on, Dean...

555
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,420
What are you doing?

556
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,060
Oh, you're just gonna
go on a little trip.

557
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,380
Way down south.

558
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,260
Look, forget Evan. Think of your dad.

559
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,340
Regna terrae,

560
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,860
Cantate deo, psallite domino.

561
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,500
Qui fertur super caelum caeli

562
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,980
Ad orientem,

563
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,300
Ecce dabit vocem suam, vocem virtutis.

564
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,580
Tribuite virtutem deo.

565
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,460
Qui fertur super caelum
caeli ad orientem,

566
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,860
Circle's broken! Come on!

567
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,900
Omnis fallaciae,

568
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,020
Libera nos domine.

569
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,220
Hostis humanae salutis.

570
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,340
Wait!

571
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,260
What the hell was that for?

572
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,700
Sealing the deal.

573
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,940
I usually like to be warned

574
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,860
Before I'm violated with demon tongue.

575
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,580
Evan Hudson is free.

576
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,860
He and his wife will live long
lives. How do I know you're not lying?

577
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,860
My word is my bond. Oh, really?

578
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,540
It is when I make a deal.

579
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,220
It's the rules.

580
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,660
You got what you wanted.

581
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,380
Now let me go.

582
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,060
You're gonna double-Cross me?

583
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,420
Funny how I'm the trustworthy one.

584
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,980
You know,

585
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,660
You renege, send me to hell,

586
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,020
Sooner or later I'm gonna climb out, and

587
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,740
Skinning Evan Hudson will
be the first thing that I do.

588
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,540
I got to tell you,

589
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,140
You would have never pulled
that stunt if you knew.

590
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,900
Knew what?

591
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,900
Where your dad is.

592
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,940
You should have made that deal.

593
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,420
See, people talk about hell,

594
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,900
But it's just a word.

595
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,660
Doesn't even come close
to describing the real...

596
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,220
Shut your mouth, bitch! If
you could see your poor daddy,

597
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,340
Hear the sounds he makes
'cause he can't even scream.

598
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,820
How about I send you back there?

599
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,460
What?

600
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,580
How did I get here?

601
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,860
<i>"Key to the Highway" by Big Bill Broonzy</i>

602
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,820
Demons lie all the time, right?

603
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,100
Maybe she was lying.

604
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,100
Come on, is that really what you think?

605
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,380
How could he do it?

606
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,500
He did it for you. Exactly.

607
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,260
How am I supposed to live with that?

608
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,540
You know, the thought of him,

609
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,180
Wherever he is right now...

610
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,580
I mean, he spent his
whole life chasing that

611
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,180
Yellow-Eyed son of a bitch.

612
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,340
He should have gone out fighting.

613
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,300
That was supposed to be his legacy,

614
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,660
You know?

615
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,340
Not bargaining with the damn thing.

616
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,620
Not this.

617
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,020
How many people do you
think dad saved total?

618
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,860
That's not the point,
Sam. Evan Hudson is safe

619
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,860
Because of what dad taught us.

620
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,420
That's his legacy, Dean.

621
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,140
Now, we're still here, man,

622
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,740
So we got to keep going.

623
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,740
For him.

624
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,060
Dean? Yeah?

625
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,860
When you were trapping
that demon, you weren't...

626
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,460
I mean, it was all a trick, right?

627
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,460
You never considered actually
making that deal, right?
