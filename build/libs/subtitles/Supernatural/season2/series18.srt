00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

1
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,430
Mitch?

2
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,800
Ashley?

3
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,950
You out here?

4
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,340
Come on,guys.

5
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,090
Where are you?

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,560
Hello?

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,110
Hello?

8
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,890
Brody.

9
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,550
Ashley and todd -- they're dead!

10
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,980
Wendy,they're dead!

11
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,990
Brody,pull it together.

12
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,580
We don't have a chance,okay?

13
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,980
We have to get out of here now!

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,560
No,brody.We are not leaving.

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,210
We have got to find my sister.

16
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:02,950
No!

17
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,800
No,I am getting out of here right now!

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,740
Brody!

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,220
Brody,get back here!

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,640
Brody!

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,070
God,you son of a bitch!

22
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,620
Cut.

23
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,540
What the hell was that?

24
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,470
Thanks.

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,460
Here you go.

26
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,730
Thanks,walter.

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,230
Don't mark that.

28
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,290
It's all good,tara.

29
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,750
That was great.

30
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,940
Uh,let's do it again.

31
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,630
Uh,maybe we try dialing up that scream,huh?

32
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,540
I know,I know.

33
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,810
I'm just -- I'm having trouble with the tennis ball.

34
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,060
That is just for cg registration.

35
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,870
When ivan and the fx guys are done,
it is going to look terrifying.

36
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,630
You want to look at the concept sketches again?

37
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,660
No,that's okay.

38
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,530
I'll -- I'll find it.

39
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,100
I know you will,pumpkin,huh?

40
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,990
Okay.

41
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,350
Going again,everybody.

42
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,980
10-minute reload for camera and sound.

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,130
No,man,I'm telling you.

44
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,530
Working alone behind the sets or after wrap,
I catch this weird vibe sometimes.

45
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,020
Like what?

46
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,990
Mmm,like something's watching.

47
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,980
Come on.

48
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,230
Hey.

49
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,930
Working on a movie like this?

50
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,070
Weird crap's bound to happen.

51
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,680
Frank thinks the stage is haunted -- like,for real.

52
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,840
All I'm saying is,they call wrap,I get done,and I get out of here.

53
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,360
Fast.

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,370
Guy is definitely off his meds.

55
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,560
Brody,come back.

56
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,020
You son of a bitch.

57
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,660
Brody,come back,you son of a bitch.

58
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,900
Hello?

59
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,190
Guys?

60
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,580
Come on.

61
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,580
It's not funny.

62
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,670
Okay.

63
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,810
Ha ha,very funny.

64
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,570
Hello?

65
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,280
Who's there?

66
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,740
Now,that's what I'm talking about!

67
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,480
---www.opensubtitles.org---

68
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,350
Supernatural Season 2 Episode 18

69
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,490
"HOLLYWOOD BABYLON"

70
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:35,260
First opened in 1927,the lot has been in 
continuous operation for eight decades.

71
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,810
Hey,you know this is where they filmed "Creepshow"?

72
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,710
Now to the right here is stars hollow.

73
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,840
"HOLLYWOOD BABYLON"

74
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,390
It's the setting for the television series "Gilmore Girls."

75
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:53,020
And if we're lucky,we might even catch one of the show's stars.

76
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,470
Come on.

77
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,150
Let's finish the tour.

78
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:03,040
And then up to the right here,we have New York Avenue,
and that's where they shot "Lois & Clark."

79
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,480
Sammy,check it out.

80
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,090
It's matt damon.

81
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,430
Yeah.

82
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,730
I'm pretty sure that's not Matt Damon.

83
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,590
No,it is.

84
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,550
Well,Matt Damon just picked up a 
broom and started sweeping.

85
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,700
Yeah,he was probably researching a role or something.

86
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,840
Uh,I don't think so.

87
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,110
Hey,this way.

88
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,180
Uh,I think stage 9's over here.

89
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,780
Come on,man.

90
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,770
Let's keep going this way.

91
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,500
No,come on.

92
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,260
We got to work.

93
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,950
Golly.

94
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,140
Dude,you wanted to come to L.A.

95
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,340
Yeah,for a vacation!

96
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,710
I mean,swimming pools and movie stars!

97
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,770
Not to work.

98
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,290
This seem like swimming-pool weather to you,dean?

99
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,760
It's practically canadian.

100
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,030
Yeah.

101
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,720
I just figured that,you know,after everything 
that happened with madison,you could use a little R&R, that's all.

102
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,790
Maybe I want to work,Dean.

103
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,090
Maybe it keeps my mind off things.

104
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay,okay,all right.

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,830
So this crew guy,what,did he ...he died on set?

106
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,160
Yeah,rumors spreading like wildfire online.

107
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,270
They're saying the set's haunted.

108
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,820
Like "poltergeist"?

109
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,160
Could be a poltergeist.

110
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,730
No,no,no.

111
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,420
The movie "poltergeist."

112
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,910
You know nothing of your cultural heritage,do you?

113
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,010
It was rumored that the set of "poltergeist" was cursed,
that they used real human bones as props.

114
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,600
Like,at least three of the actors died in it.

115
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,810
Yeah,might be something like that.

116
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,740
All right,so this crew guy.

117
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,680
What's his name?

118
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,930
Frank jaffe.

119
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,080
You got a death certificate or a coroner's report?

120
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,920
Well,no,but,uh,it's L.A.,You know?

121
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,340
That might not even be his real name.

122
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,120
But the girl who found him,she said 
she saw something ... a vanishing figure.

123
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
What's the girl's name?

124
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,080
Uh,tara benchley.

125
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,260
Whoa,tara benchley?

126
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,260
From "feardotcom" and "ghost ship" tara benchley?

127
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,100
Dude,why didn't you say so?

128
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,440
So now you're suddenly on board?

129
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,110
I mean,I'm a fan of her work.

130
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,490
It's -- it's very good.

131
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:51,790
No,look.

132
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,510
Don't get me wrong.

133
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,420
Everyone at this studio loves the dailies,myself included.

134
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,990
We were just wondering if it could be...

135
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,850
you know,a little brighter.

136
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,470
Brighter?

137
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,650
Yeah,jay,more color.

138
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,790
Mcg,you know what I'm saying.

139
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,140
You're the master of that stuff.

140
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,880
Brad,this is a horror movie.

141
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,550
Who says horror has to be dark?

142
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,720
It's just -- it's sort of depressing,don't you think?

143
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,650
Uh,excuse me.

144
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,530
Uh,green-shirt guy?

145
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,110
Yeah,yeah,you.Come here.

146
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,140
Can you get me a,uh,smoothie from craft?

147
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,060
You want a what from who?

148
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,250
You are a P.A.

149
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,560
This is what you do.

150
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,540
Yeah,he,uh...

151
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,030
One smoothie coming right up.

152
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,530
What's a P.A.?

153
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,580
I think they're kind of like slaves.

154
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,100
They'll let anybody in this business,huh?

155
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,190
6,6,6 -- mark.

156
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,620
Ready!

157
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,500
Okay,why don't we take it from,
"come on,it'll be fun"?

158
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,720
And action.

159
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,280
Come on.

160
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,660
It'll be fun.

161
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,590
Dicta sunt explicabo.

162
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,000
God,I hate you so much right now.

163
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,180
Cut!

164
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,360
Very nice.

165
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,930
So?

166
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,710
No emf anywhere.

167
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,400
Great.

168
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,190
So,what do you think?

169
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,200
Well,I think being a P.A.Sucks,but...

170
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,220
but the food these people get?

171
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,840
Are you kidding me?

172
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,260
I mean,look at these things.

173
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,490
They're like miniature philly cheesesteak sandwiches.

174
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,940
They're delicious.

175
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,420
Maybe later.

176
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,060
What did you find out about the dead crew guy?

177
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,030
Uh,frank jaffe was just filling in for the day.

178
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,370
Nobody here knew him or where he lived or anything.

179
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:45,950
Oh,great.

180
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,200
So you found out about as much as I did.

181
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,120
Hey,guys.

182
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,170
Oh,hey.

183
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,630
They're wonderful.

184
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,680
Listen.

185
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,850
I did dig up some stuff about stage 9's history.

186
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:00,260
Four people died messy here over the past 80 years, 
 two suicides and two fatal accidents.

187
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,890
Any one of those could be a vengeful spirit.

188
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,220
Yeah.

189
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,100
Just got to narrow it down more.

190
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,150
I'll get right on that.

191
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,260
Hey,are you supposed to get one of these?

192
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,920
I..I don't really know what I'm doing.

193
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,060
First day?

194
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,980
Yeah,my big break.

195
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,550
You know,I know it's really uncool to say this,but I'm a big fan.

196
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,750
I loved you in "boogeyman."

197
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,730
Oh,god.

198
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,760
What a terrible script.

199
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,100
Uh,but,thank you.

200
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,610
Yeah.

201
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,590
You found him,right?

202
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,850
The -- the dead guy?

203
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,330
I'm sorry.

204
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,720
You probably don't want to talk about this.

205
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,190
No,no,actually,it's -- it's okay.

206
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,660
Nobody around here really brings it up very much.

207
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,120
I think they're all scared I'm gonna 
have some kind of breakdown.

208
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,020
That must have been awful.

209
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,310
What happened?

210
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,100
It was horrible.

211
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:27,730
There ... there was all this blood coming 
from his eyes,from his mouth,and,uh...

212
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,990
I saw this,um...

213
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,830
what?

214
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,010
I saw this shape.

215
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,970
To tell you the truth,I don't know actually what I saw.

216
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,770
I just know I saw it.

217
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,830
Thanks,walter.

218
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,940
Uh,so this -- this crew guy frank,did you know him?

219
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,140
No,not that well.

220
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,730
That's funny.

221
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,200
It's like no one around here actually knew the guy.

222
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,480
I got his picture.

223
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,360
You do?

224
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,150
Yeah.

225
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,510
I take polaroids of all the crew.

226
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,200
It's just one of those things you do to kill time on the set.

227
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,490
right there.

228
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,830
Son of a bitch.

229
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,210
Gerard st.James?

230
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,480
Yes?

231
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,310
You're still alive,and you're not Frank jaffe.

232
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,510
NO

233
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:40,180
You were -- you were desert soldier number 4 in 
"Metalstorm: The destruction of jared-syn."

234
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,060
I was.

235
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,770
I knew I recognized you.

236
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,670
I am a huge fan.

237
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,620
I mean,your turn as the tractor-crash victim in "Critters 3" ...wow.

238
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,570
Hey,well,please.

239
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,340
Come in.

240
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,270
Thanks.

241
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,470
Yeah,it was the producers.

242
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,610
I mean,they brought me in for the day to play frank.

243
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,760
Just to fake your death?

244
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,270
Well,rumors of a haunted film set...

245
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:16,880
free publicity,especially when you're making a horror movie
I mean,it's already all over the internet.

246
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,500
Yeah,we know.

247
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,050
These days,it's all about new media,building buzz.

248
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,250
They say I'm the new "lonelygirl."

249
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,840
Who?

250
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,760
And the ghost tara saw?

251
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,280
Projected on a screen of diffusion.

252
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,990
Isn't that kind of cruel...

253
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,380
messing with their heads like that?

254
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,390
Hey,I just play the part.

255
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,040
I don't write the script.

256
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,010
Speaking of...

257
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:48,470
I'm playing willy in a dinner-theater production
of "salesman" at costa mesa all next month.

258
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,430
Get a free pepper steak with the coupon.

259
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,180
Well,now,wait a second.

260
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,510
If you're seen in public,won't that ruin the hoax?

261
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,750
Oh,please.

262
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,410
Frank and willy ,,, totally different characters.

263
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,760
You know what?

264
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Thanks very much,Mr. Saint.James.

265
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,750
It was just nagging at us.

266
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,820
But we're ...we're very glad,you know,
you're alive and well.

267
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,160
Yeah.

268
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,290
Absolutely.

269
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,320
I wanted to ask you.

270
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,810
What was it like working with Richard Moll?

271
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,850
He's from "metalstorm."

272
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,110
He was Hurok,King of the Cyclops people.

273
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,010
Gentleman's gentleman.

274
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,380
Yeah?

275
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,620
All right.

276
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,100
Pepper steak.

277
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,340
When we read from that book,we must have 
brought them back...back from hell.

278
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,490
Now they're trying to use us...

279
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,880
It doesn't matter.

280
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,030
We're not going till we find Wendy and her sister.

281
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,380
Got it?

282
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,300
Good.

283
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,910
Now,let's get busy.

284
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,690
Cut!

285
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:56,550
No good for sound.

286
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,490
I'm getting some kind of feedback.

287
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,160
Another costly sound delay.

288
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,060
All right,we're going again for sound,people!

289
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,520
Thank you!

290
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,930
No,it's a great scene,really ..dynamite.

291
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,080
But I still got a few...

292
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,330
not -- not problems,just questions.

293
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,670
Like what?

294
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,280
Well,for one thing 
The rules aren't really landing for me.

295
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,570
Like,the kids do this latin chant,
and that makes the ghosts show up?

296
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,660
Yeah.

297
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,670
If the ghosts are in hell,
how do they hear the chanting?

298
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,580
I mean,what,do they have super hearing?

299
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,680
Well,it's a logic bump.

300
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,310
The rules don't track.

301
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,080
Marty,you're the writer.

302
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,690
What about throwing in an explainer?

303
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,450
Yeah,that'd be super.

304
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,070
I got to check some messages.

305
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,690
Suits.

306
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,260
Has mcg seen this?

307
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:10,340
I like the whole body-paint,
black-and-white thing,but,gee,I...

308
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,460
I don't think those neck wounds are 
really gonna read on-camera.

309
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,770
They need to be red.

310
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,470
You know what I'm saying?

311
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,650
Hey,jay!

312
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,640
I need to speak to makeup.

313
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,340
Yeah?

314
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,460
Wait up.

315
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,050
When we read from that book,
we must have brought them back ...back from hell.

316
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,260
I don't understand.

317
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,450
If they were in hell,how could they hear our chanting?

318
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,380
They must have super hearing.

319
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,140
Wendy?

320
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,980
Oh,mitch!

321
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,230
God,you're alive!

322
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,000
You won't get rid of me that easy.

323
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,250
Rumble,rumble,rumble!

324
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,270
Salt.

325
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,250
Okay,we need salt.

326
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,440
I read in that book that it keeps ghosts away.

327
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,390
Kendra,logan,you guys check the back.

328
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,680
The poor bastard killed himself,like,for real.

329
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,390
Shouldn't we shut it down or something?

330
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,030
We had a moment of silence for him at breakfast.

331
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,820
He was just a studio guy.

332
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,230
Shh.

333
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,350
I love you.

334
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,260
I know.

335
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,170
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,840
Can we ...can we cut or something?

337
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,200
uh,yeah.

338
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,600
Cut.

339
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,380
Cut!

340
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,570
That's a cut!

341
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,400
Only I get to say "cut."

342
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,340
Hey,what's up?

343
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,200
I'm just a little upset.

344
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,850
With everything that's been going on,
who can blame you?

345
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,750
I just can't wrap my head around the dialogue,
you know?

346
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,970
"Salt" -- doesn't that sound silly?

347
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,480
I mean,why would a ghost be afraid of salt?

348
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,100
Okay,um...

349
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,710
marty,what do you think?

350
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,220
Not married to salt.

351
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,770
What do you want?

352
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,580
We still sticking with condiments?

353
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,540
Mmm,it just sounds different,not better.

354
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,120
What else would a ghost be scared of?

355
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,880
Oh,you got to be kidding me.

356
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,400
What would a ghost be scared of?

357
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,160
Maybe shotguns.

358
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,620
That makes even less sense than salt.

359
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,370
These people are idiots.

360
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,280
Walter's a little testy for a P.A.,Huh?

361
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,510
How's it going in here?

362
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,930
Really good -- tara has stepped up her performance,
and I think it's from the sense-memory stuff.

363
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,770
Sense-memory?

364
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,890
Yeah.

365
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,730
Dean,you know,when I ask how it's going here,
I'm talking about the case,right?

366
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,330
We don't really work here.

367
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,240
You know,I thought you hated being a P.A.

368
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,990
I don't know.

369
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,730
It's not so bad.

370
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,590
I kind of feel like part of the team,you know?

371
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,420
It's good.

372
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,530
Oh,taquito?

373
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,700
They're wonderful.

374
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,530
No.

375
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,460
Um,listen.

376
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,030
I conned my way into the morgue.

377
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,990
News reports are right.

378
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,640
Brad's a doornail -- no question.

379
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,670
Copy that.

380
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,410
Sorry.What?

381
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,270
"Copy that"?

382
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,040
What did you say?

383
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,170
The news reports are right.

384
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,010
Brad's a doornail.

385
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:43,920
They're aware.

386
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,840
Who's aware?

387
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,520
Sorry.

388
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,460
What were you saying?

389
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,440
Uh,uh,the newspaper's right.

390
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,390
Brad's a doornail.

391
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,330
No question about it.

392
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,090
I guess it's a good thing we didn't skip town.

393
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,070
Oh,come here.

394
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,510
I want you to hear something.

395
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,430
Copy that.

396
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,710
On my way.

397
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,480
Hey,dave.

398
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,540
Can you play that thing you were playing me earlier?

399
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,910
Sure.

400
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,720
Thanks.

401
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,540
It doesn't matter.

402
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,840
We're not leaving till we find Wendy and her sister.

403
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,090
Got it?

404
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,240
Good.

405
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,930
Now,let's get busy.

406
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,170
E.V.P.

407
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,880
From the night of brad's stage dive.

408
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,030
All of a sudden,I'm getting electromagnetic 
readings up the wazoo.

409
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,210
For some reason,it's a legit haunting now.

410
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:28,980
Well,whose ghost,dean?

411
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,710
What's it want?

412
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,300
I think we should take a look at brad's death scene.

413
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,550
Now,where'd you get this dvd?

414
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,090
They're called dailies.

415
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,270
I got it from cindy.

416
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,480
She's kind of got this thing going with drew.

417
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,220
He dubbed me an extra copy.

418
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:05,950
All right.

419
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,650
Here's where the guy fell through the roof.

420
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,170
Right.

421
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,140
All right,here we go.

422
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,940
They must have super hearing.

423
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,400
Wait.

424
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,710
Go back,go back.

425
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,870
Right after -- right after -- yeah,right.

426
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:24,940
Wait.

427
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,300
There.

428
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,160
It's like "3 men and a baby" all over again.

429
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:39,260
Selleck,danson,and guttenberg,and 
I don't know who played the baby.

430
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,390
What's your point?

431
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,980
There's a scene where people say 
that the camera caught a ghost on film.

432
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,210
Apparently,in the background of one of the scenes,
there was this boy that nobody remembers.

433
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,130
Spirit photography.

434
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,830
I've seen her before.

435
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,960
Here.Check this out.

436
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,370
Yeah,go for ozzie.

437
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,170
No,I don't have a 20 on tara.

438
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,160
I think she's 10-100.

439
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,800
Okay,copy that.

440
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,130
I'm sorry.

441
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,520
What were you saying?

442
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,370
Elise drummond -- starlet back in the '30s.

443
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,870
Had an affair with a studio exec.

444
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,410
He uses her up,fires her,leaves her destitute.

445
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,410
Elise hangs herself from stage 9's 
rafters right into a scene they're shooting.

446
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,900
Just like our man brad.

447
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,840
So,what,she's got it in for the studio brass?

448
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,970
Possibly.

449
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,420
I mean,it's a motive,and brad's 
death matches hers exactly.

450
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,490
We're digging tonight,aren't we?

451
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,090
That's a wrap,people!

452
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:50,170
6:00 A.M.Call for crew tomorrow.

453
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,390
Great work,everybody!

454
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,640
Mcg,you're a genius.

455
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,080
You're kickin' ass and taking names.

456
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,330
Good night,jay.

457
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,400
Yeah.

458
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,410
Which way?

459
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:08,990
over here.

460
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:15,730
Hey.

461
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,880
Yeah?

462
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,610
Hey,this map is totally worth the 5 bucks.

463
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:25,010
Hey,we got to go check out Johnny Ramone's 
grave when we're done here.

464
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,720
You want to dig him up,too?

465
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,080
Bite your tongue,heathen!

466
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,070
You know,dean,what I don't get is,why now?

467
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,800
I mean,after 75 years,Elise Drummond 
suddenly goes homicidal.

468
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,910
You know,why this movie?

469
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,110
Well,maybe she's mad they're making a scary ghost flick.

470
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,500
Is it really that scary?

471
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,550
Here we go.

472
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,700
Yahtzee.

473
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,140
I know.

474
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,330
No,I friggin' hate mcg's dailies.

475
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,690
I can't control the guy.

476
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,970
I'm telling you -- next one I'm directing myself.

477
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,910
What,you?

478
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,010
No,bob.

479
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,200
You I love.

480
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,180
You're a genius.

481
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,490
You're kicking ass and taking names.

482
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,060
Yeah,okay.

483
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,080
Yeah.

484
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,130
Talk to you later,babe.

485
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,410
Uh-huh.

486
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,280
What a dick.

487
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,240
Oh,great.

488
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,660
Hey,guys!

489
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,620
Producer walking here!

490
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,350
Hello!

491
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,870
Hey!

492
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,080
Hey,pal.

493
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,190
Can you,uh,show me to the exit?

494
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,400
I can't see a damn thing here.

495
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,890
Hey!

496
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,170
Hey,putz.

497
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,550
I'm talking to you.

498
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,330
Somebody could get hurt here.

499
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,310
What the hell?

500
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,960
No!

501
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,850
No!

502
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,130
They never forgive.

503
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,410
They never forget.

504
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,650
Mitch?

505
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,940
Ashley?

506
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,850
This summer,they're coming back again to settle the score...

507
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,350
again.

508
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,290
You out here?

509
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,910
Ashley and todd -- they're dead!

510
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,060
Wendy,they're dead!

511
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,640
These bastards aren't taking us,not without a fight.

512
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,150
I am getting out of here right now!

513
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,340
Brody!

514
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,080
From the makers of "Cornfield Massacre"...

515
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,300
"Monster truck," "Charlie's angels"...

516
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,760
"Charlie's Angels 2: Full throttle"...

517
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,190
and "Hell hazers" comes a new experience in terror.

518
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,050
We must have brought them back 
...back from hell. <i>AGAIN</i>

519
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,560
<i> "HELL HAZERS 2: THE RECKONING" </i>

520
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,090
<i> This film not yet rated </i>

521
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,970
 Rolled in with a giant fan.

522
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,990
Same thing happened to an electrician back 
in '66 -- a guy named Billy Beard.

523
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,320
What the hell,dude?

524
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:39,960
I don't know.

525
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,430
It doesn't seem like Elise this time.

526
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,240
We already torched her.

527
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,390
Are we dealing with another ghost?

528
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,060
Maybe.

529
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,050
Yeah,but these things don't usually tag-team.

530
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,210
Everybody!

531
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,800
Gather around,okay?

532
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,390
I got an announcement to make.

533
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,910
Hold that for me.

534
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,020
Everyone!

535
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,430
Huddle in!

536
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:13,880
In light of jay's accident last night and in cooperation with 
the authorities,we're shutting down production for a few days.

537
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,000
I know,I know.

538
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,820
Look,I'm not going to lie to you.

539
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,430
We've had a few setbacks this week.

540
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:24,750
But we all know what jay and brad wanted more than anything.

541
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:31,380
And that was to see "Hell Hazers 2: The Reckoning" 
on screens all across America.

542
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:38,230
Now,we owe it to them to go on and to 
pull together and make this damn movie,huh?

543
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,600
But... but ... but ... but ...but not ... not today.

544
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,330
Go home.

545
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,090
Someone will call you.

546
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,360
Wendy.

547
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,740
What,are you afraid of ghosts?

548
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,470
Come on.

549
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,070
It'll be fun.

550
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,940
Hey.

551
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,160
Hey.

552
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,540
So,you find out where the electrician's buried?

553
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,940
He wasn't.

554
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,600
Billy beard was cremated.

555
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,500
Great.

556
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,940
Now what?

557
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,280
No idea.

558
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,660
Anymore ghost cameos in the dailies?

559
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,090
Not in the first six hours.

560
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:19,960
You know.

561
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,110
Maybe the spirits are trying to shut 
down the movie 'cause they think it sucks.

562
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,640
'Cause,I mean,it kind of does.

563
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,300
From,uh,"come on,it'll be fun"?

564
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,090
Come on.

565
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,450
It'll be fun.

566
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:49,310
Listen to the invocation.

567
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,310
Dean,that's the real deal 
a necromantic summoning ritual.

568
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,100
What the hell is that doing in a hollywood movie?

569
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,550
No,dear.

570
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,830
We're down for a few days.

571
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:05,490
It's cool,
it gives me time to pitch that time-travel thing.

572
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,690
Yeah.

573
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,300
All right,well,look.

574
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,320
Get back to me on this,all right?

575
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,180
Seriously.

576
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,920
No,I'm serious.

577
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,020
Dude,are you serious?

578
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,420
'Cause I'm serious.

579
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,590
All right.

580
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,710
Cool.

581
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:16,930
Guys,we're all shut down.

582
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,070
What are you still doing here?

583
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,660
Yeah,uh...

584
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,580
really sorry,man.

585
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,040
We -- we -- we couldn't help ourselves.

586
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,840
We just had to tell you that we read the script.

587
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,910
And?

588
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,100
Yeah.

589
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,400
It's,uh...

590
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,300
it's awesome.

591
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,500
Awesome.

592
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,640
Really awesome.

593
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,050
I know.

594
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,200
It's pretty rockin',right?

595
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,340
I'm glad you guys liked it.

596
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:38,940
Yeah.

597
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,740
I-I really liked all the attention to detail.

598
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,250
Dude,right on.

599
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:42,770
That's my thing.

600
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,060
I mean,you know,color me guilty,but that is me.

601
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,830
I'm a total detail buff.

602
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:52,670
No,I mean,the way you worked in all those Enochian 
summoning rituals and all the authentic language and...

603
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,750
what,you mean that latin crap?

604
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:57,480
No,man.

605
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,670
That's walter.

606
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,790
Walter Dixon,the original writer.

607
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,320
You like that garbage?

608
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,880
Wait,walter -- the P.A.Walter?

609
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,920
No,he's not a P.A.

610
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,860
He's got a clause in his contract that 
allows him to come on set.

611
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,410
But he wrote the invocations?

612
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,120
He wrote a wackjob screenplay.

613
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,790
There's no pace.

614
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,890
There's no love interest.

615
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,390
It's all wackadoo exposition.

616
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,570
I had to cut,like,90% of it to make it readable,
another 10% to make it good.

617
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,850
Should have kept walter's original script.

618
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,110
It's actually pretty good.

619
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,720
Yeah.

620
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,770
And it reads like a how-to manual of conjuration,

621
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,720
like a textbook on how to summon ghosts 
and get them to do whatever you want.

622
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,940
Yeah,like kill people.

623
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,270
Yep.

624
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,510
So let's say somewhere down the line,
Walter learned some pretty black magic.

625
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,120
Yeah,and let's say he's pissed at these 
people for wrecking his movie.

626
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,500
Motive and means.

627
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,680
It's worth checking out.

628
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,490
So?

629
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,190
You wanted to meet?

630
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,300
Hey,I'm a little busy here,buddy.

631
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,570
I'm working on a script.

632
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:09,070
Oh,yeah.

633
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,820
You guys worked on it a lot.

634
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,360
It needed work.

635
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,130
Now,why couldn't we have done this in my office?

636
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:19,080
You know,the history,the lore in my draft was completely accurate.

637
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:25,900
We could have gotten it right for the first time ever 
in this whorehouse of a town,but you tore it to shreds.

638
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,020
You replaced it with cleavage and fart jokes.

639
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,680
It was real.

640
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,110
Who gives a rat's ass about real?

641
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,420
We're talking about ghosts here,Walter.

642
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,350
There's no such thing.

643
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,380
That's where you're wrong,martin.

644
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,560
Okay,nutjob...

645
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,860
end of meeting.

646
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,950
C oh,my god,no!

647
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,500
Please,no!

648
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,250
You ruined it,martin!

649
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,850
Everything I worked for!

650
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,040
Oh,god!

651
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,080
Walter!

652
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,660
Now you're gonna find out what being a ghost is like!

653
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,160
Walter,please!

654
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,180
Walter,help me!

655
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,030
Help!

656
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,890
You are one hell of a P.A.

657
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,440
Yeah,I know.

658
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,060
What are you doing?

659
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,930
Could ask you the same thing,walter.

660
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,490
Raising these spirits from the dead?

661
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,800
Making them murder for you?

662
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,730
That's playing with fire,walter.

663
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,530
You don't understand.

664
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,070
You know what?

665
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,550
You're right.

666
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,950
I don't understand.

667
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,100
Wait,look.

668
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,710
You put your heart and soul into something,
years of hard work ... years.

669
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,330
And then they take it,and they crap all over it!

670
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,550
And then -- and then they want you to smile and say thank you.

671
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,170
Walter,listen.

672
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,000
It's just a movie.

673
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,170
That's it.

674
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,660
Look.

675
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,070
I got nothing against you,man.

676
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,000
You're not part of this.

677
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,290
Just please -- please,just leave.

678
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,320
But martin's got to stay.

679
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,900
Sorry,can't do that.

680
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,500
It's not that we like him or anything.

681
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,830
It's a matter of principle.

682
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,520
Then I'm sorry,too.

683
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,520
Walter.

684
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,670
Walter,pl-- don'T.

685
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,410
Sam!

686
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,750
Come on.

687
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,060
Come on.

688
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,080
Come out to the coast.

689
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,500
We'll get together,have a few laughs.

690
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,000
Oh,man!

691
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,520
I can't frickin' believe this.

692
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,530
Ghosts are real.

693
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,870
What makes you say that?

694
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,320
But I don't understand.

695
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,510
How is walter controlling them?

696
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,310
Probably that talisman.

697
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,430
What are you doing?

698
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,180
If film cameras pick these suckers up,then...

699
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,980
maybe,uh...

700
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,710
dean,right there!

701
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,650
Hey!

702
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,920
Right there!

703
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:35,770
Here.

704
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:36,400
Get the idea?

705
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:36,870
Yeah.

706
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,720
All right,you hold them off.

707
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,210
I'm going after walter.

708
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,980
I cannot believe there's an afterlife.

709
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,720
There's an afterlife,all right.

710
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,750
But mostly it's a pain in the ass.

711
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,470
There!

712
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,790
It's over,walter.

713
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,480
TherE.

714
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,310
Okay,now no one can have it.

715
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,610
I wouldn't have done that if I were you.

716
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,860
Yeah?

717
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,930
Why not?

718
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,510
'Cause you just freed them.

719
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,100
We can't stop them now.

720
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,260
Walter,you brought them back...

721
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,420
forced them to murder.

722
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,760
They're not going to be very happy with you.

723
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,090
Yeah?

724
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,480
So,why not?

725
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,510
Oh,god.

726
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,620
There!

727
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,290
But I don't understand.

728
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,630
How come the spirits appear in the camera phone?

The video must pick up their frequencies in a way that our eyes can't.

730
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,730
Oh,God.

731
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,900
Right there!

732
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,190
Cut!

733
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,760
Oh,print that one.

734
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,990
That's in the movie.

735
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,630
Oh!

736
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,220
Loved it,kids, loved it!

737
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,920
You find out there's an afterlife,
and this is what you do with it?

738
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,870
I needed a little jazz on the page.

You're one hell of a P.A.

740
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,130
Thank you.

741
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,180
Hi.

742
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,890
God, I love this town.
