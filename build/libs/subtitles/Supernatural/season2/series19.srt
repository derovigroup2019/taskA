1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,169
Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off:

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:07,006
Saving people, hunting things.

3
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:08,632
The family business.

4
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,302
You were the bank robber
on the 11:00 news, not me.

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,805
- Yeah?
- This is Agent Victor Henricksen.

6
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,766
My job's to bring you in.
Alive's a bonus, but not necessary.

7
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,686
I've been looking for you for weeks.
And I know about Sam.

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,939
I know about the murder in St. Louis,
the Houdini act in Baltimore.

9
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:27,609
I know about the desecrations
and the thefts.

10
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,111
I know about your dad.

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,904
You don't know crap about my dad.

12
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,616
We are so screwed.

13
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,309
Well, this makes a lot of sense.

14
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:04,146
First, they close down the cellblock
and now they open it back up again.

15
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,815
There's your tax dollars at work, huh?

16
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,402
Here.

17
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,323
You got that ready?

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,587
Yikes.

19
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,464
Would hate to have gotten
thrown in here.

20
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,682
- Hey, you feel that, man?
- What?

21
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,064
Whoa. What was that?

22
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,603
Uh...

23
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,694
Hey.

24
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,237
Hey, guard. Hey.

25
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,754
Come on, man.

26
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,424
Hey. Guard.

27
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,385
Come here. Come on. Help me.

28
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,221
Going down to B block. Randall again.

29
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,057
Copy that.
Come on, man.

30
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,978
- Hey. Guard, hey.
Shut up, old man.

31
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,938
Come on. I'm trying to sleep.

32
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,691
You telling me you didn't see that?
What are you, blind?

33
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,859
Hey!

34
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,112
Randall, cool it.

35
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,239
Cool it, my ass.
There's somebody there.

36
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,451
Turn out your light and go to sleep.
I'm not gonna say it again.

37
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,620
Yeah, Randall, shut up.

38
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,264
Lights out, B block.

39
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,892
Copy that. Lights out.

40
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,269
Good night, ladies.

41
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,306
- Aah! God!
What's going on, man?

42
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,811
What's going on?

43
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,278
No. No. No.

44
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,489
No! No! No!

45
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:46,493
No! No! No!

46
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,705
Aah, no!

47
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,269
This way.

48
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,983
I hate this plan, Dean.

49
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,277
Yeah, I got that
the first 10 times I heard it.

50
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,741
Freeze.
Don't move.

51
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,285
I said freeze!
Hold it right there.

52
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,956
Put your hands behind your heads.
Sit down on your knees. Now.

53
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,833
I got them.

54
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,128
- Hands behind your back.
The other hand.

55
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,888
Front. To the right.

56
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,682
I call this one the "Blue Steel."

57
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,311
Yeah, that's great. To the right.
Okay, back to the lineup.

58
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,605
- Who looks better, me or Nick Nolte?
- Shut up.

59
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,989
Well, it's about time.
I'll have a cheeseburger.

60
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,410
Extra onions.

61
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,915
You think you're funny.
- I think I'm adorable.

62
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,168
It is a pleasure to finally meet you
in person, Dean.

63
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:06,007
I'm Special Agent Victor Henricksen.
This is my partner, Special Agent Reidy.

64
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:12,264
Henricksen.
Not the Milwaukee Agent Henricksen.

65
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,182
Live and in person.

66
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,017
Ha.

67
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,771
Oh, nice shot.

68
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,275
You can hang that up in your cell
at Supermax.

69
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,069
All right, maybe we can just forget
the cheeseburgers, huh?

70
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,322
Oh, yeah. Keep that game face on.

71
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,243
Try and cover up how cornered you are.
Read him the charges.

72
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,955
Well, we got mail fraud, credit card fraud,
grave desecration.

73
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,206
Skip to the good ones.

74
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,545
Armed robbery, kidnapping,
and, oh, three counts of first-degree murder.

75
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,215
And after Milwaukee, your brother is now
a suspect in a murder case himself.

76
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:51,553
I'd say for you two, "screwed to hell"
is a major understatement.

77
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,097
Well, where there's life,
there's hope, huh?

78
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,933
Ah, see, that's what I kept thinking...

79
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,895
...as I was searching for your assess
all over hell and gone.

80
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,940
Your dad taught you well.

81
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,068
The way you cover your tracks.
And after Milwaukee, the way you...

82
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,071
...vanished.

83
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,407
Near went nuts trying to find you.

84
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,744
- Ask him.
- He near went nuts.

85
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,956
And after all of that, you get tripped up
on a motion detector.

86
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,585
Pretty rookie move.

87
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,254
Gotta say, I was...

88
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,422
...surprised.

89
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,846
- Dean Winchester?
- In the flesh.

90
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,182
- And you are?
- Mara Daniels, Public Defender's Office.

91
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,184
I've been assigned you
and your brother's case.

92
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,352
Oh.

93
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,772
- Are you Henricksen?
- Yeah, and we're not quite done here.

94
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,274
Uh, yeah, you are.

95
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,943
And if you don't mind...

96
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,987
...I would like
to meet with my clients, privately.

97
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,953
Unfortunately, your arraignment
on the breaking and entering charge...

98
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
...won't be until Tuesday.

99
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,623
- And they'll keep us in the county jail?
- That's right.

100
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,959
- Green River County Detention Center?
- Yes.

101
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,628
And considering the charges
you're facing...

102
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,505
...no judge is going to grant bail.

103
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,299
Yeah, we figured that.

104
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:15,303
Extradition papers have already been filed
from five separate states.

105
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,639
Missouri and Wisconsin
being the biggest...

106
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,516
...the robbery and the murder raps.

107
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,476
How long can we stall extradition?

108
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,230
A week. Maybe less.

109
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,823
All right, let's go. Watch your step.

110
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,033
Come on. Keep moving.

111
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,055
- You're mine, baby.
Looking good, move it along.

112
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:03,059
Don't worry, Sam,
I promise I won't trade you for smokes.

113
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,748
I call top bunk.

114
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,919
Okay.

115
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,901
My roommate
doesn't say much, how's yours?

116
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,153
He just keeps staring at me...

117
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,323
...in a way that makes me really uneasy.

118
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,618
- It sounds like you're making new friends.
- Dean.

119
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,622
This is, without a doubt, the dumbest,
craziest thing we've ever done.

120
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,458
And that's in a long, storied career
of dumb and crazy.

121
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,002
Calm down. It's all part of the plan.

122
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,089
Oh, really? So Henricksen
showing up was part of the plan?

123
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,092
Yeah, that guy moves
a little faster than I thought.

124
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,595
Look, all we gotta do is find this ghost,
put the sucker down...

125
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,139
...then grab ourselves
a couple of teardrop tattoos.

126
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,933
That's not funny.

127
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,602
Dean, what about this escape plan? It-?

128
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,146
It's 100-percent sure.
I wouldn't have gone in if it wasn't.

129
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,526
I mean, come on, man,
this place has all the signs of a haunting.

130
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,946
- Innocent people are dead. Four so far.
- Yeah, innocent.

131
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,033
You from Texas all of the sudden?
Just because people are in jail...

132
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,994
...doesn't mean they deserve to die.
If we don't stop this...

133
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:48,289
...people are gonna continue to.
We do the job wherever it takes us.

134
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,709
Look, Dean,
just be straight with me, all right?

135
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,170
- You're doing this for Deacon.
- Damn right.

136
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,964
Well, you barely even know the guy.

137
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,635
We know he was in the corps with dad.
He saved Dad's life. We owe him.

138
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,138
But don't you think
he's asking a little much?

139
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,973
It doesn't matter.

140
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,934
We may not be saints,
but we're loyal and we pay our debts.

141
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,146
Now, that means something to me
and it ought to you.

142
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,150
I'm not thrilled about this either,
but Deacon asked us to hunt this...

143
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,985
...and that's what we're gonna do.

144
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,035
- You know, this chicken isn't half bad.
- Great. Finish mine.

145
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,247
All right, so let's go back over this.

146
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,041
Spirit suspect number one
is Mark Moody, right?

147
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,837
Yeah. Psycho-killer extraordinaire.
Satanism. Ritual murder. Died in jail.

148
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,839
- Are you sure it's him?
- Pretty sure.

149
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:42,177
Dean, considering our circumstances,
I'm gonna need a bit better than pretty sure.

150
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,678
Really pretty sure.

151
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,350
Moody died of a heart attack, which is
what the victims in here are dying of.

152
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:53,188
He died in the old cellblock, which they
closed after he croaked, 30 years ago.

153
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,774
They opened that back up,
the killings started.

154
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,859
You think his spirit
was released somehow?

155
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,068
Mm-hm.

156
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,237
What if he was already cremated?

157
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,699
I'm guessing there's something
that belongs to him keeping him around.

158
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,787
Whatever it is, we gotta find it,
and you know the rest. I'm done.

159
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,546
- Sorry, I-
- Watch where you're going.

160
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,799
- Yeah, sure, I just-
- He said he was sorry.

161
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,135
Dean.
- You talking to me?

162
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,055
Are you talking to me?

163
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:31,434
Great, another guy who's seen Taxi Driver.
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

164
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,562
Trust me. Let it go.

165
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,234
Dean, come on.

166
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,070
See, that's how you gotta talk
to these guys.

167
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,321
Instant respect.

168
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,284
You were saying?

169
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,956
Oh, great.

170
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,502
We can end this right now.
No harm, no foul.

171
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,469
That's enough!

172
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,514
On your feet, Lucas.

173
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,643
Yes, sir, boss.

174
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,944
- What's your name?
- Winchester.

175
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,447
Well, Winchester, not a good start.

176
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,123
Solitary.

177
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,458
You too, Lucas.

178
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,170
Yes, sir.
- Are we having fun yet, huh?

179
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,194
I wish I had a baseball.

180
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,655
What?

181
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:11,659
- What did you say?
- I said I wish I had a baseball.

182
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,329
You know, like Steve McQueen.

183
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:19,083
Yeah. Well, I wish I had a bat,
so I could bash your fricking head in.

184
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,920
Okay.

185
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,840
Well, so much
for the bonding-in-solitary moment.

186
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,440
Oh, crap.

187
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,958
Lucas, listen to me. Stay very still.

188
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,281
Aaarggh!

189
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,004
Henricksen?

190
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,755
Hey, Daniels.

191
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:48,965
Can I have a word?

192
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,968
Have a seat. What's on your mind?

193
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,388
I've been going through the Winchester
charges, and I gotta say...

194
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,765
...there are some weird inconsistencies.

195
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,434
Welcome to my world.

196
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,812
I talked to a cop in Baltimore
who swears up and down...

197
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,149
...these boys saved her life,
and helped her catch a killer.

198
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,818
There's a witness
to your robbery in Milwaukee...

199
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,738
- ...she swears Sam and Dean saved her life.
- From what?

200
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,866
- She was a little unclear on that.
- That's because she's nuts.

201
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:19,037
I was in Milwaukee.
I spoke to her, to all the witnesses.

202
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,040
- And?
- And, all I know is...

203
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:26,002
...wherever these guys go, people die.
It's that simple.

204
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,254
I don't know that it is.

205
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,215
They just don't seem cut-and-dry
guilty to me.

206
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,094
- I think there's more to this.
- Like what?

207
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,971
I don't know.

208
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,765
I can't put my finger on it.

209
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
It's just...

210
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,852
...strange.

211
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,812
Strange?

212
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,316
Yeah, okay.

213
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:54,655
Grownups are trying to get some
work done here, so if you don't mind...

214
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,007
How you doing?

215
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:19,680
I'm 54 years old, mopping the floor
of a crapper with bars on the windows.

216
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,891
How you think I'm doing?

217
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,353
All right.

218
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,563
Bad ice-breaker.

219
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,107
I'm Sam.

220
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,111
- Randall.
- Nice to meet you.

221
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,280
Randall? Hey, weren't you there
the night that guard died?

222
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,159
- Yeah.
- Well, what happened?

223
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,954
They say the stress of the job got him.

224
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,623
Yeah? What do you say?

225
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,631
Why are you inside, kid?

226
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,513
Because I got an idiot for a brother.

227
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,099
- That'll do it.
- Yeah.

228
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,685
Well, this place ain't so bad.

229
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,104
Compared to the old cellblock,
this is the Hilton.

230
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,191
You spent time in the old block?

231
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,694
Oh, yeah, I was a regular customer.

232
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,447
- Didn't they have Mark Moody for a while?
- He was there.

233
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,868
I was there too,
the night that lunatic bought it.

234
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,329
Yeah. It was a heart attack, right?

235
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,959
His heart stopped after the guards
stopped using his head for batting practice.

236
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,964
Next morning, I was in his cell
mopping up the blood. What a mess.

237
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,301
Wait, so he was beaten
and nobody reported it?

238
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:43,431
You kept your mouth shut unless you
wanted to die from the same heart attack.

239
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,019
Randall...

240
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,771
...exactly how much blood was there?

241
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,942
Call.

242
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,903
Three aces.

243
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,657
That's a bad beat.

244
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,660
That's bad beat, but see, I'm full.

245
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,246
Threes over aces.

246
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,416
Ha-ha. I'm sorry.
Hey, it's a cruel game, my friend.

247
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,464
Sorry, guys.

248
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,471
- It's like picking low-hanging fruit.
- You don't even smoke.

249
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,765
You kidding?
This is the currency of the realm.

250
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,269
Look, I got a good lead on Moody.
- Yeah, me too.

251
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,605
- His spirit paid a visit last night.
- What?

252
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:37,276
Clock-stop, flickering lights, cold spot.
I mean, he did everything but yell, "Boo."

253
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,695
- What happened?
- He walked right by me.

254
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,740
Lucas wasn't so lucky.
I mean, the way he was screaming...

255
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,576
The guy was a jerk,
but he didn't deserve to go like that.

256
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,286
What did you find out?

257
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,248
Yeah, so I think I know
where we might find his remains.

258
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,084
- Blood in his old cell.
- I thought it was a heart attack.

259
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,835
After the guards worked him over.

260
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:58,047
Apparently there was so much blood,
they had trouble mopping it out.

261
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,966
How we gonna get in?

262
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,009
I got a plan.

263
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,886
That's the Sammy I know.

264
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,806
You're like Clint Eastwood
from Escape From Alcatraz.

265
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,684
Problem is, if we find something,
how are we gonna burn it?

266
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,185
We don't have any accelerant.

267
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,356
Good thing I'm like James Garner
from The Great Escape.

268
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,820
Hey, fellas, who's ready to deal?

269
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,785
- You sure about this?
- Pretty sure.

270
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,914
Yeah, well, considering the circumstances,
I'd like a little better than pretty sure.

271
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,208
Okay, really pretty sure.

272
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,129
I'd like mine al dente.

273
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:41,924
Perfect.

274
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,013
Save room for dessert, Tiny.
Ha-ha-ha.

275
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,973
Hey, I wanted to ask you...

276
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,018
...because I couldn't help but notice
you are two tons of fun.

277
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:56,647
Just curious, is that a thyroid problem or is
that some deep-seated self-esteem issue?

278
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,402
Because, you know,
they're, uh, just doughnuts.

279
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,279
They're not love.

280
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,971
Guys, give me a hand.

281
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,976
Get him off.

282
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:59,001
- If we waited any longer, you'd be dead.
- You waited long enough.

283
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,965
Do yourself a favor. Don't talk.

284
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,510
Take them both up to the infirmary.

285
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,444
- Hey, Tiny.
- Yeah?

286
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,698
Hey, sorry about the things
I was saying earlier.

287
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:14,702
I can't really tell you why,
but I had to get you angry.

288
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,495
So...

289
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,249
- Anyway, sorry.
- It's okay.

290
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,878
The truth is,
I have low self-esteem issues.

291
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,465
My old man treated me
and my brother like crap.

292
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,425
Right up until the day he died.

293
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,010
How'd he die?

294
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,720
My brother shot him.

295
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,890
Okay.

296
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,689
- Oh, crap.
- What is it?

297
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,128
What's going on?

298
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,265
Oh, God.

299
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,975
What is it?

300
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,834
No!
Tiny.

301
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,586
Tiny!

302
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,089
Guard!

303
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,633
Guard!

304
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,140
Wait, you're telling me it wasn't Moody?

305
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,685
Unless he liked going around
dressed like a nurse.

306
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,145
Poor Tiny, man. Poor, giant Tiny.

307
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,482
So this is like the ghost of some
nurse who worked here or something?

308
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,985
- I don't know, I guess.
- "I don't know, I guess"...

309
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:14,363
...isn't really working for me.
See, I thought we were done.

310
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,241
I called Deacon, it's happening.
We're getting out tonight.

311
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,577
I guess we gotta do
some quick research, then.

312
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:24,623
How? I mean, maybe you haven't noticed,
we're in jail.

313
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,167
So you wanna know about some nurse?

314
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,461
- Why do you wanna know?
We got our reasons.

315
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,840
But we'll make it worth your while.

316
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:40,806
So this nurse, she would have had
white hair, one screwed-up eye.

317
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,975
- Is that ringing a bell?
- Yeah.

318
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,393
Yeah, I remember her.

319
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:48,188
- You remember her name?
- No, that's still kind of fuzzy.

320
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,738
Give it to him.

321
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,782
- I earned these.
- Dean.

322
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,459
Glockner. Nurse Glockner.

323
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,754
- Nasty old bitch worked here in the '70s.
- You know her?

324
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,340
I met her once.
I had to get a tetanus shot.

325
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,967
She damn near jabbed the needle
through my arm.

326
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,928
- At least I got out of there alive.
- What do you mean?

327
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,390
There were stories,
I don't know if they were true.

328
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:26,560
- Cons love to talk, but we're all liars.
- What kind of stories?

329
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:31,023
Guys would go up with a cold,
next thing, they're in a body bag.

330
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,068
A whole rash of heart attacks.
Young guys. Old guys.

331
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,736
- Heart attacks?
- Yeah. The story was...

332
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,571
...Glockner had it out for cons...

333
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:42,910
...and she did this Charles Bronson thing
with a hypodermic.

334
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,162
That was the rumor.
Nobody proved anything.

335
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,623
- So whatever happened to Glockner?
- I don't know.

336
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,083
I finished my bit and left.

337
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,710
Next time I landed back in here,
she was gone.

338
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,505
Let's say those stories
on Glockner were true.

339
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:58,008
It's a thought. In life she's a vigilante.
In death, same thing.

340
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,427
But how's she tied in
with the old cellblock?

341
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,763
If she's going after cons,
why kill that guard?

342
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:06,016
I did hear in the yard
that guard wasn't exactly squeaky clean.

343
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,895
So, well, maybe she's going after anybody
that breaks the law, like me.

344
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,564
- You heard in the yard?
- Yeah.

345
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,610
Dean, does it bother you at all
how easily you seem to fit in here?

346
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,654
- No, not really.
- All right, well, listen.

347
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,532
Either way, we need more info on Glockner.
If she's buried.

348
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,033
If so, where?

349
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,120
And we got five hours to get it.

350
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,707
Don't give me that
we-gotta-see-this-thing-through look.

351
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,834
We are leaving tonight, no matter what.

352
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,420
I just don't wanna let Deacon down.
We owe him.

353
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,338
But we don't owe him our lives, Dean.

354
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:43,137
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go talk with our lawyer.

355
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,307
You want me to what?

356
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,644
Her name was Glockner, okay?
She worked here as a nurse in the '70s.

357
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,940
Now, I need you to find out everything
about her, most importantly how she died.

358
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,900
- And where she's buried.
- Are you nuts?

359
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,195
You have any idea
the kind of the trouble you're in?

360
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,488
I have a vague notion.

361
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,575
Good, so let's forget about some
random nurse and talk about your case.

362
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,036
- Mara. It's Mara, right?
- Yeah.

363
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,831
I get that you're trying to help me, okay?
I do.

364
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,334
But believe me when I say
that this is the best way that you can help.

365
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,129
Really, how? Explain that to me.

366
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:21,175
I wish I could, but I can't. I'm just gonna
have to ask you to trust me on this.

367
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,051
Why should I?

368
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:27,681
- Henricksen says you're a monster.
- I'm a monster?

369
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:34,938
Well, he's wrong, okay?
I'm not what they say I am.

370
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,692
- Everybody says that.
- Yeah.

371
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,738
If you're as smart a PD as I think,
then you can tell with just one look...

372
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,949
...whether or not your clients are guilty,
okay? Just like that.

373
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,036
So I want you to look at me. Really look.

374
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,038
And you tell me, am I guilty?

375
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,626
We're not the bad guys.

376
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,221
- She go for it?
- No. No, not so much.

377
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,557
- Maybe she'll still come around.
- We can't wait around to find out.

378
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:14,394
- We could give it another day.
- No, we're leaving tonight, and that's it.

379
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,438
Not gonna finish?
We're gonna let people die?

380
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,732
Don't give me that.
This was your stupid plan.

381
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,026
I went along,
but we're sticking to the plan.

382
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,655
Okay, you leave, I'm gonna stay.

383
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,699
- Hey, don't turn away from me.
- Screw you.

384
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:28,867
What? Screw you.

385
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,286
Hey, hey.

386
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:34,248
All right, hard case.
I see the usual methods ain't gonna work.

387
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,209
You too, sweetheart.

388
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,420
Come on.

389
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,641
Take off.

390
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,644
I wanna handle this alone.

391
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,080
Deacon, you are beating the holy hell
out of me, man.

392
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,791
Sorry, Dean.

393
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,293
I thought I was going easy on you.

394
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,548
Just trying to make it look real.

395
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,134
Yeah, well, mission accomplished.

396
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,803
So is it over?

397
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,431
- No. It turns out it wasn't Moody.
- What?

398
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,558
- Yeah.
- Then who?

399
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,685
It's some nurse
who used to work here.

400
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,103
But we're shy on all the intel.

401
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,897
Which is why
we should stick around.

402
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,982
Oh, hey, guys.
- You wanna fight for real?

403
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,817
- We gotta go now.
Guys.

404
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,362
We're leaving. Otherwise we'll be leaving
for Milwaukee with Henricksen.

405
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,780
- Oh, come on.
- Guys.

406
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,616
What?

407
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,453
Your lawyer left this for you.

408
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,500
Would you look at that?
Man, I am frigging velvety smooth.

409
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,004
You wanna open it after you're done
patting yourself on the back?

410
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,964
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

411
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,509
- Wow.
- What?

412
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,678
Well, you wanna share
with the class, Dean?

413
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,348
Glockner died in the old cellblock
after Moody bit it.

414
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,893
It seems they had a little inmate uprising,
she got caught in the middle.

415
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,897
They dragged her to a solitary cell,
gave her severe cerebral edema.

416
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,524
- Someone bashed her head in.
- Yeah.

417
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,485
- Say where she's buried?
- Yep.

418
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,071
Then let's get you the hell out of here.

419
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,741
Don't worry, we'll get rid of this thing.

420
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,164
Good, because I want it
out of my prison.

421
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,501
Boys, uh...

422
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,754
...I can't thank you enough for this.

423
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,882
I know it was asking a lot,
but you still came through.

424
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,093
Your daddy raised you right.

425
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,805
Well, we owed you.

426
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,895
I hope to see you again, huh?
Just not in here, okay?

427
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,648
- Yeah. We'll do our best.
Right. Yeah.

428
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,235
Oh.

429
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,154
- Where do you want it?
- What?

430
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,576
Yeah, um...

431
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,412
Uh...

432
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,414
Make it look real, son.

433
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,097
Oh, man, are you a sight for sore eyes.

434
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,731
You know, I almost wish
I could see Henricksen's face.

435
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,108
Really? I'd be happy
if I never saw him again.

436
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,903
- We're not really out of the woods yet.
- Yeah.

437
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,701
Good point.

438
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,793
I told you, one of them
came up behind me.

439
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,129
- You let them get the drop on you?
- Yeah.

440
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,464
I screwed up, all right?

441
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,800
- What do you want me to say?
- I wanna know where they're headed.

442
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,803
- How the hell would I know?
- Let's start over again.

443
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,764
For God's sake.

444
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:22,517
Again. I wanna know everything they did
today from the minute they woke up.

445
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,272
Got up.

446
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:31,651
Breakfast. Visiting hours. Rec time.

447
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,823
- Any visitors?
- Just their lawyer.

448
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,667
It's an easy question.
What did you and Dean talk about?

449
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,169
I have already told you...

450
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,380
...it was a private conversation
between me and my client.

451
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,509
Right. And just three hours later,
he just happened to bust out.

452
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,805
Now, tell me what he said.

453
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,366
We gotta move it.
If Henricksen gets to the lawyer...

454
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,953
I thought she couldn't say anything.
That lawyer-client privilege thing.

455
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,205
The privilege doesn't apply, Dean.

456
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,375
- So she'll talk?
- She has to.

457
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,335
Oh, that's frigging super.

458
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,878
Let me make this simple.

459
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,714
You don't come clean,
I will put you on the hook for abetting.

460
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,007
That's ridiculous.

461
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,593
Don't think that I can?
You think this is some game?

462
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,596
I am the last person on planet Earth
you wanna screw with.

463
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,893
Now, tell me what he said.

464
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,775
He wanted me to do some research.

465
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,280
On a prison nurse that died in 1976.

466
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,574
What? Why?

467
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,784
- I don't know.
- What else?

468
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,080
They wanted to know
where she was buried.

469
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,707
Did you find out where?

470
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,752
- Yeah.
- Did you tell them?

471
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,090
Yeah.

472
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,474
Tell me.

473
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,812
Got her.

474
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,931
Aah!

475
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,367
You let those two go.

476
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,789
You sure this is the right cemetery?

477
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,334
She said Mountainside.
Mountainside Cemetery.

478
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,789
- You thought we were screwed before.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

479
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,665
We gotta go deep this time.

480
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,793
Deep, Dean?

481
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,669
We should go to Yemen.

482
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:45,048
Oh, I'm not sure
I'm ready to go that deep.
