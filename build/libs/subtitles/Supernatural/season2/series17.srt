00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,927
San Francisco California

2
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,947
Hey, Maddie.

3
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,436
Listen,I,uh,hate to pull you away,

4
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:33,123
but I'm gonna need you to come back to the office with me.

5
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:34,727
Really?

6
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,627
Yeah,it turns out I got to file those docs by midnight.

7
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,177
I'm gonna need you to,um...

8
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,587
This isn't working at all,is it?

9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,057
No,it's not,Nate.

10
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,227
Listen,I've had a couple.

11
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,107
I shouldn't really drive.

12
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,137
- Could you just give me a lift --
-  I already called you a cab.

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,517
I'll see you in the morning.

14
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,557
Does that happen a lot?

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,867
Only on the days that end with a "Y.

16
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,607
" You okay?

17
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,827
Yeah.

18
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,867
I've got to go.

19
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,107

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,237
Supernatural 2x17 - HEART

21
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,327
here is the detective

22
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,547
That's a pretty nasty bite.

23
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,457
You know what bit him?

24
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,167
I haven't quite determined that just yet.

25
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,657
Come on,doc.

26
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,057
Off the record.

27
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,227
Okay,way,way off the record.

28
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,337
If I didn't know better,
I'd say the guy was attacked by a wolf.

29
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,117
But unless I know that the zoo is missing one of their lobos,
I'm going with pit bull.

30
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,787
I like my job.

31
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,977
Yeah,I hear you.

32
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,977
One more thing.

33
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,777
This guy -- was his heart missing?

34
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,107
Yeah,how did you know that?

35
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,637
I haven't even finished my report.

36
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,157
Lucky guess.

37
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,017
This lawyer guy first heart-free corpse in town?

38
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,277
First man.

39
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,707
Over the past year,several women have gone missing.

40
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,107
Dead bodies all washed up later in the bay,
too deteriorated to draw firm conclusions.

41
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,357
- But no hearts.
- No hearts

42
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,117
They were all hookers working at hunter's point.

43
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,912
Cops are trying to keep things under wrap,

44
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:32,527
- but they're looking for a serial killer.
- And the lunar cycle?

45
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,927
Yeah,month after month,all the murders happened 
in the week leading up to the full moon.

46
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,197
- Which is this week.
- There is the lawer

47
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,447
Awesome.

48
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,987
Dean,could you be a bigger geek about this?

49
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,231
I'm sorry,man,but what about a human by day,

50
00:04:45,234 --> 00:04:48,269
a freak animal killing machine by 
moonlight don't you understand?

51
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:51,914
We haven't seen one since we were kids.

52
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,407
Okay,sparky.

53
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,707
Then you know what?

54
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,842
- After we kill it,we can go to disneyland.
- Know what the best part about it is?

55
00:04:57,845 --> 00:05:01,965
We already know how to bring these suckers down.

56
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,867
So what's our next move?

57
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,717
Talk to the girl who found the body.

58
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,507
Madison: I don't understand.

59
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,947
I already gave my statement to you.

60
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,427
Well,we just need to verify a few things.

61
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,627
This is my neighbor glenn. Glenn,this is detective...

62
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,913
landis.
And detective dante.

63
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,087
Well,guess I'll leave you to it.

64
00:05:22,914 --> 00:05:23,628
Okay.

65
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:25,087
Thanks for the casserole.

66
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,327
Oh,how thoughtful.

67
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,517
Just call if you need anything.

68
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,027
He's sweet.

69
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,927
He came over to check on me.

70
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,177
Have- have a seat.

71
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,637
You must be pretty shaken up.

72
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,307
You were nate mulligan's assistant,right?

73
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,307
For two years,yeah.

74
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,997
So you knew all about him.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,287
Probably knew more about him than he did.

76
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,297
Nate was...

77
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,907
he was nice.

78
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,287
But...

79
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,711
You get a few scotches in him,and he started hitting 
on anyone in a 5-miles radius.

80
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:03,657
You know the type.

81
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,067
Yeah. I do,actually.

82
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,367
- Did,uh,did he have any enemies?
- What do you mean?

83
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,164
Sure looked like an animal attack.

84
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,417
We're just covering all the bases.

85
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,640
Anyone that might have had a beef with him

86
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:21,388
- former client,an ex.
- What?

87
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:23,045
Well,this is embarrassing,

88
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,773
but my ex-boyfriend,kurt.

89
00:06:24,776 --> 00:06:26,340
- Kurt have a last name?
- Mueller

90
00:06:26,378 --> 00:06:28,287
After we broke up,he went kind of nuts.

91
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,447
He's...

92
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,867
well,he's kind of been stalking me.

93
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,077
He got it in his head that something was going on between Nate and I.

94
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,667
He showed up at my office.

95
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,484
- And what happened?
- Kurt got into it with nate.

96
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:41,456
Threw a punch before security grabbed him.
I was lucky to keep my job.

97
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:42,717
When was the last time you saw kurt?

98
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,817
A few nights ago.

99
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,487
Actually,the night Nate died.

100
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,277
We were all grabbing drinks at this bar,and Kurt showed up.

101
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,117
And?

102
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,037
Nothing.

103
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,637
It was...

104
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,677
like he was watching me.

105
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,167
Then he was gone.

106
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,597
Tell you the truth...

107
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,957
he scares me.

108
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,717
So,what do you think?

109
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,797
Stalker ex-boyfriend.

110
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,037
He hates the boss.

111
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,287
And he was there that night.

112
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,687
Think he's our dog-faced boy?

113
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,827
Well,it's a theory.

114
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,777
We've had worse.

115
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,947
What do you say we pay kurt a visit?

116
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,967
Nothing but leftovers and a six-pack.

117
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,677
Check the freezer.

118
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,057
Maybe there's some human hearts behind the 
haagen-dazs or something.

119
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,507
Sam,come here.

120
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,337
Check it out.

121
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,347
Somebody there?

122
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,387
I'll call 911.

123
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,777
I'd say Kurt's looking more and more like our cujo.

124
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,737
If he's out here,we better check on Madison.

125
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,497
What's going on?

126
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,517
Police business,glenn.

127
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,677
What is it?

128
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,077
Well,maybe we should talk privately?

129
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,267
Has kurt been here?

130
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,007
Not exactly.

131
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,087
What exactly does "not exactly" mean?

132
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,377
Well,he was outside last night -- just looking.

133
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,617
Just looking at me.

134
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,697
Has he done something?

135
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,347
- We're not really sure.
- It's probably nothing.

136
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,427
But...

137
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,767
we just don't want to take any chances.

138
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,939
In fact,one of us should probably stay here with you,

139
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:02,669
just in case he stops by.

140
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,297
- Where does he work?
- He owns a body shop.

141
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:08,217
You mind grabbing that address for us? Thanks.

142
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,107
- All right,you go.I'll stay.
- You go after the creepy ex.

143
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,407
I'm gonna hang here with the hot chick.

144
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,637
Why do you always get to hang out with the girls?

145
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,067
Because I'm older.

146
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,627
No,screw that. We settle this the old-fashioned way.

147
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,797
Dean,always with the scissors.

148
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,227
Shut up. Shut up. Two out of three.

149
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:36,660
God!

150
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,447
Bundle up out there,all right?

151
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,037
- Um,do you want to sit on the couch?
- No. No,no,I'm okay.

152
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,797
- It's more comfortable.
- Uh,I'm fine.

153
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,967
You know,I think I will sit on the couch.

154
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,107
Let me guess.

155
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,095
You're sitting on her couch trying to think of something to say.

156
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:48,823
- Did you find kurt?
- He hasn't been at work all week,

157
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:52,029
but because I'm good,
and I mean really,really good,

158
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:54,847
I got a line on where he might be.

159
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,467
- What's she wearing?
- Bye,dean.

160
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,237
Oh,sammy.

161
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,717
- Who died and made you sheriff? 
- I will call who I want.

162
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,457
Whatever you want. Look what time it is.

163
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,347
- You're gonna wake her up and start talking about -
- I saw that.

164
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,217
What? Saw what?

165
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,793
Okay,this is the deal --

166
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:31,097
my house,my tv.

167
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,254
I never get to watch my show,

168
00:13:33,257 --> 00:13:35,092
so suck it up.

169
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,462
wait,so 

170
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:52,691
so kindall married ethan's father just to get back at him?

171
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,227
And now she's set to inherit all the casinos that were supposed to go to ethan.

172
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,597
What a bitch!

173
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,957
- Admit it -- you're hooked.
- No,no,no,no,no,no.

174
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,467
I wouldn't say I'm hooked.

175
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,407
Can I ask you a question?

176
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,617
It's ... it's a little personal.

177
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,917
You've seen my entire underwear collection.

178
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,217
Go ahead.

179
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,997
Okay,um...

180
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,627
well,you're -- you're clearly smart.

181
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,557
I mean,your house is full of great books,you know?

182
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,957
- And you're independent.
- Uh-huh.

183
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,987
What were you doing with kurt?

184
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,367
I don't know.

185
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,281
I mean,it's not like he introduced himself,like,

186
00:14:41,284 --> 00:14:44,050
"hi,I'm possessive and controlling,and I like to punch people.

187
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:46,826
Want to be my girlfriend?

188
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:48,065
" Yeah,well,

189
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:49,841
I guess we all make mistakes.

190
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:52,527
Yeah,well,mine's wanted by the police.

191
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,257
You want to know why I stayed with him? Really?

192
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,917
I was too insecure to leave.

193
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,267
Well,I find that hard to believe. You don't really seem like the type.

194
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,427
Yeah,well some stuff happened.

195
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,397
My life changed,I changed,for the better,I think.

196
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,717
- What happened?
- Well,for one thing,I got mugged.

197
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,637
And that's supposed to be a good thing?

198
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,342
I know,it sounds strange,

199
00:15:16,345 --> 00:15:17,802
and don't get me wrong -- it rattled me --

200
00:15:17,805 --> 00:15:20,031
but then it hit me.

201
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:25,087
I could keep feeling sorry for myself 
or I could take control of my life.

202
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,197
I chose the latter.

203
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,767
First thing I did was tell kurt he had to go.

204
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,047
- Smart move.
- Apparently.

205
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,027
Everything else just opened up,blossomed.

206
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,187
It's all been wonderful,really.

207
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,347
What?

208
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,341
Doesn't everybody think that being a victim of random violence is

209
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,465
the best thing that ever happened to them?

210
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,547
Yeah,not so much.

211
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,867
You're...

212
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,597
unusual.

213
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,237
Unusual like...

214
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,157
- "unusual"?
- No,no,no.

215
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,087
Unusual like...

216
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,687
impressive.

217
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,797
You think so?

218
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,127
Sorry.

219
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,346
- Hey.
- I found him.

220
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,657
Good. Don't take your eyes off him.

221
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,217
Oh,yeah,my eyes are glued.

222
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,197
Look,sammy,I got to let you go.

223
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,807
I,uh,I don't want to miss anything.

224
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,777
So,um...

225
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,887
I'm gonna turn in.

226
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,847
Okay,yeah.

227
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,107
- Well,I'll be here.
- Okay.

228
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:01,247
If you hear anything,if you wake up,just -- just call out.

229
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,767
- Okay.
- Okay.

230
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,807
- Dean,you okay?
- Yeah,now that I'm conscious.

231
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,667
The werewolf knocked me out.

232
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,157
Sam,it's madison.

233
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,247
What? !

234
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,797
Yeah,awesome job of keeping an eye on her.

235
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,037
Dean,I've been here the whole time.
She's in bed asleep.

236
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,357
Well,she wasn't an hour ago.

237
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,947
Check her right arm. I nicked her with a silver knife.

238
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,707
Morning.

239
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,567
Um,wherare my pajamas?

240
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,097
Sam?

241
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,117
What's going on?

242
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,237
Where are you going?

243
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,257
I'm not going anywhere.

244
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,707
And neither are you.

245
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,607
you're psychotic.

246
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,517
The whole "I'm a cop" trick.
God,I am so stupid.

247
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,847
Well,I guess neither of us are who we said we were,huh?

248
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,307
Sam,you're sick,okay?

249
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,707
You're imagining things.

250
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,237
Monsters don't exist. Not really.

251
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,607
You know what? Save the act.

252
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,547
It's not an act!

253
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:56,177
I am not a werewolf! There is no such thing!

254
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,587
It's made up,all right?

255
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,797
They're not real! You know they're not real!

256
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,657
No? Then where did that come from?

257
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,027
I don't know!

258
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,057
Sam,god,you need help.

259
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,107
Please,don't do something that you're gonna regret.

260
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,797
I'm not what you think I am.

261
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,517
I'm not.

262
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,447
How you doing?

263
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,087
My head feels great,thanks.

264
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,507
We got to talk.

265
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,537
She says she has no idea what I'm talking about.

266
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,687
She's lying.

267
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,793
Maybe. Or maybe she really doesn't know she's changing.

268
00:20:45,796 --> 00:20:48,727
Maybe when the creature takes over,she blacks out.

269
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,617
Like a really hot incredible hulk?

270
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,937
Dude,she ganked her boss and her ex-boyfriend. 
That doesn't sound ration unconscious.

271
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,487
But what if it was,dean?

272
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,907
What if some animal part of her brain saw 
both those guys as threats?

273
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,327
- Hell,the cop,too.
- Are you the dog whisperer now?

274
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,157
Look,man,I just...

275
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,549
I don't know. There was something in her eyes.

276
00:21:06,552 --> 00:21:07,584
Yeah,she's killing people.

277
00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:10,160
- But if she has no control --
- xxxxxx

278
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:12,156
even if she's telling the truth,
it's not gonna change anything.

279
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,575
I'm not putting a bullet through some girl who 
has no idea what's happening.

280
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:16,145
sam she is master
You're feeling sorry for her?

281
00:21:16,148 --> 00:21:18,007
Maybe I understand her.

282
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,567
Look,there might be another way we can get the job 
done without having to waste her.

283
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,797
Are you thinking what I think you're thinking?

284
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,767
Dad's theory.

285
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:38,047
Lycanthropy might have a cure if you kill the werewolf 
who bit you,severing the bloodline.

286
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,067
Might have a cure. Meaning "who knows?

287
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,367
- " It's worth a shot.
-  We don't even know where to look.

288
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,267
The puppy that bit her --
it could be anyone,anywhere. Could have been years ago.

289
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,447
No,I don't think so.

290
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,347
Madison...

291
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,597
when were you mugged?

292
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,207
Please,it's important,all right?

293
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,647
Just answer the question.

294
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,567
About a month ago.

295
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,397
- Did you see the guy?
- No.

296
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,747
He grabbed me from behind.

297
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,327
Did he bite you?

298
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,377
How did you know that?

299
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,787
Where?

300
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,897
O-on the back of my neck.

301
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,477
Oh,that's just a love bite.

302
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,977
Believe me,that could have been a lot worse.

303
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,817
- Where were you at the time?
- Walking home from a friend's loft.

304
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,757
Let me guess.

305
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,477
Not too far from hunter's point?

306
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,227
Same place where those other murders happened.

307
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,677
I'm telling you,it's the werewolf's hunting grounds.

308
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,117
But that doesn't mean it's gonna be out there tonight.

309
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,827
It's the right time of the lunar cycle.

310
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,647
I know it's a long shot.

311
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,737
You're forgetting something.

312
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,077
Maddie's probably gonna turn soon.

313
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,557
We can't let her take off to an all-you-can-eat buffet.

314
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,727
I'll stay with her.

315
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,327
And if she busts loose?

316
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,681
- Sam?
- I'll do it.

317
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,717
- Sam.
- I'll shoot her,all right?

318
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,697
But,dean,I need you to go out there.

319
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,177
At least go look for the thing.

320
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,377
Dean,please.

321
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,137
We can save this girl.

322
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,197
Fine.

323
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,987
Please.

324
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,307
Just let me go.

325
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,327
Look...

326
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,117
I know you're scared.

327
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,377
I also know that there's no way in hell you're gonna believe me.

328
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,517
But I'm doing this...

329
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,957
because I'm trying to help you.

330
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,270
I'm not gonna lie,all right?

331
00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:28,757
The odds aren't exactly in our favor.

332
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:34,467
But if this goes the way I pray it does...

333
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,535
I'll untie you,

334
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:41,067
and I'll walk out that door,
and I'll never come back.

335
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,607
You'll live the rest of your life...

336
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,247
and I'll just be a bad memory.

337
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,657
Hey!

338
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,447
It happened...

339
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,127
again.

340
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,527
Where am I?

341
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,507
H-help me.

342
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,667
God. Oh,my god.

343
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,637
easy gelen
just take it easy

344
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,407
It should be over now.

345
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,347
You'll never see me again.

346
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,197
It was sort of sad,actually.

347
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,857
Glenn had no clue what was going on.

348
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,497
Why do you think he turned Madison 
instead of just killing her?

349
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,807
I don't know.

350
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,017
He kind of seemed to have a thing for her.

351
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,487
Maybe his primal instinct did,too.

352
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:26,077
Maybe he was looking for a little hot breeding action.

353
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,787
Yeah. Something like that.

354
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,977
So?

355
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,117
So what?

356
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,797
- Speaking of madison...
- oh,whatever.

357
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,757
- You liked her. Maybe,uh -
- dean.

358
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,832
She thought I was a stark-raving lunatic.

359
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:39,593
You saved her life.

360
00:28:39,596 --> 00:28:41,547
But she doesn't know that.

361
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,137
You know,for a stakeout, your car's a bit conspicous.

362
00:28:46,454 --> 00:28:47,637
What are you still doing here?

363
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,687
Honestly? Uh...

364
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,433
we're pretty sure you're not gonna turn tonight,

365
00:28:52,436 --> 00:28:54,859
but we got to be 100%,

366
00:28:54,862 --> 00:28:57,457
so,you know,we're... lurking.

367
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:02,137
- Look,I know this sounds crazy -
- it sure does.

368
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,187
Well,if we're gonna wait it out...

369
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,697
we might as well do it together.

370
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,737
You were telling the truth,weren't you?

371
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,907
About everything.

372
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,997
What you did -- it was to help me.

373
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,867
Yeah.

374
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,317
I did all those horrible things...

375
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,527
when I turned.

376
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,757
You didn't know.

377
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,857
So when will we know for sure?

378
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,817
- Moonrise?
-  No,I don't think so.

379
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,027
You turned middle of the night last night.

380
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,337
I think we got to hang in until sunup.

381
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,877
Well,looks like we got ourselves a few hours to kill.

382
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,837
Poker,anyone?

383
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,027
Oh,no,you guys talk.

384
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,567
Does -- does this mean it worked?

385
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:52,267
Yeah,I think so.

386
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,527
Oh,god,thank you.

387
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,407
Thank you so much.

388
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,227
You too,Dean.

389
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,617
Thank you.

390
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,527
Ah,don't mention it.

391
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:22,667
So,I'm just gonna head back to the hotel and 
watch some pay-per-view or something.

392
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,897
That was smooth.

393
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,727
He means well.

394
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:38,177
He means he thinks you're gonna get laid.

395
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,567
- Look,I --
- it's okay.

396
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,727
No.

397
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,087
I know I scared the crap out of you,all right?

398
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,837
I -- I mean,I tied you to a chair.

399
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,837
That's right up there with me scratching up your face.

400
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,587
There's just no way...

401
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,427
we could go back,you know?

402
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,537
To before it happened.

403
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,757
You're right.

404
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,027
There's just no way.

405
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,917
she -- she turned.

406
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,907
What?

407
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,087
I couldn't grab her in time.

408
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,037
We'll find her,sammy.

409
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,657
I already called bobby.

410
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,267
He doesn't know anything,except he 
knew severing the bloodline wouldn't work.

411
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,687
They all say it's impossible to reverse it.

412
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,807
How come she didn't turn when we were with her?

413
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,498
You put her to bed and then she wolfed out.

414
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:20,817
Maybe she's got to be asleep to turn.

415
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,177
What the hell does it matter?

416
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,767
We got to find some way to help her,some legend we missed.

417
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,537
Don't you think someone we know would have known?

418
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,247
Then we have to look harder until we find something.

419
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,497
Sammy,I don't think we got a choice here anymore.

420
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:34,697
What?

421
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,107
- She's a sweet girl,but part of her is -
- evil?

422
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,737
Yeah.

423
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,567
That's what they say about me,dean.

424
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,007
So me you won't kill,but her you're just gonna blow away?

425
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,757
Sam?

426
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,207
Madison,where are you?

427
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,787
I don't -- I don't -- I don't know where I am.

428
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,817
Do you see any street signs?

429
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,027
Um... yeah,yeah.

430
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,517
Middle point.

431
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,407
Hold on,maddie.

432
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,597
We're coming to get you.
Just stay where you are.

433
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,837
I don't remember anything.

434
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,347
I probably killed someone last night.

435
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,877
Didn't I?

436
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,567
There's no way to know yet.

437
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:29,407
Is there something else we can try to make it go away?

438
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,637
We'll find something.

439
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,657
There's got to be some answer -- somewhere.

440
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,387
That's not entirely true.

441
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,387
Madison,you deserve to know.

442
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,757
We've scoured every source.

443
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,227
There's just no cure.

444
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,237
Is -- is he right?

445
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,567
Well,we could lock you up at night,but...

446
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:06,087
you bust out,and some night you will...

447
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,947
someone else dies.

448
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,987
I'm sorry. I am.

449
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,337
So I guess that's all there is to it,then.

450
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,357
Stop it. Don't talk like that.

451
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,567
Sam,I don't want to hurt anyone else.

452
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,617
I don't want to hurt you.

453
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,527
Put that down.

454
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,857
I can't do it myself.

455
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,787
- I need you to help me.
-  Madison,no.

456
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,797
Sam.

457
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,037
- I'm a monster.
- You don't have to be.

458
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,367
We could find a way,all right?

459
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,367
I can. I'm gonna save you.

460
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,957
You tried.

461
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,817
I know you tried.

462
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,797
This is all there is left.

463
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,957
Help me,sam.

464
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,287
I want you to do it.

465
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,717
- I want it to be you.
- I can't.

466
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,987
I don't want to die.

467
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,747
I don't.

468
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,937
But I can't live like this.

469
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,697
This is the way you can save me.

470
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,487
Please.

471
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,947
I'm asking you to save me.

472
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,527
sam

473
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,287
I'm sorry.

474
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,867
No,you're right.

475
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,407
She's right.

476
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,467
- Sammy,I got this one.
- I'll do it.

477
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,487
She asked me to.

478
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,517
- You don't have to.
- Yes,I do.

479
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,387
Please.

480
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,967
Just wait here.
