Nothing's impossible.

You of all people know that.

It's coming to get you.

45
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,079
There's an east wind coming, Mycroft. Coming to get you.

Y-a-a-a-argh!

50
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,920
Sherlock? Help me!

51
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,759
HE WHISTLES

52
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,680
Experiment complete. Conclusion, I have a sister.

53
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,959
This was you? All of this was you?!

54
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:14,759
Conclusion two, my sister, Eurus, apparently,

55
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,360
has been incarcerated from an early age in a secure institution

56
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,160
controlled by my brother. Hey, Bro!

57
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,360
Why would you do this, this pantomime? Why?!

58
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,600
Conclusion three, you are terrified of her.

59
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,720
You have no idea what you're dealing with. None at all!

60
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,759
New information, she's out.

61
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,319
That's not possible.

62
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,319
It's more than possible, she was John's therapist.

63
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,159
- Shot me during a session.
- Only with a tranquilliser.

64
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:41,040
- Hm. We still had ten minutes to go.
- Well, we'll see about a refund.

65
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,360
Right, you two, Wiggins has got your money by the gate,

66
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,840
don't spend it all in one crack den.

67
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,159
SQUEAK!

68
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,759
Oh, I hope we didn't spoil your enjoyment of the movie.

69
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,800
You're just leaving?!

70
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,319
Well, we're not staying here, Eurus is coming and, er...

71
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,560
someone's disabled all your security.

72
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,959
Sleep well!

73
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,600
Dr Watson, why would he do that to me? That was insane!

74
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,639
Er...yes, well, someone convinced him that you wouldn't tell the truth

75
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,759
unless you were actually wetting yourself.

76
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,399
Someone?

77
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,680
Probably me.

78
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,879
So, that's it, is it? You're just going?

79
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,120
Well, don't worry, there's a place for people like you,

80
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,120
the desperate, the terrified.

81
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,279
The ones with nowhere else to run.

82
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,720
What place?

83
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,319
221B Baker Street.

84
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,199
See you in the morning. If there's a queue, join it.

85
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,560
For God's sake, this is not one of your idiot cases!

86
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,279
You might want to close that window.

87
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,920
There is an east wind coming.

88
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,480
You have to sit in the chair.

89
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,720
They won't talk to you unless you sit in the chair, it's the rules.

90
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,920
- I'm not a client!
- Then get out.

91
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,000
She's not going to stay there, is she?

92
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,959
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- Thank you.

93
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,399
The kettle's over there.

94
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,000
So, what happens now? Are you going to make deductions?

95
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,759
You're going to tell the truth, Mycroft. Pure and simple.

96
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,680
Who was it said, "The truth is rarely pure and never simple"?

97
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,480
I don't know and I don't care.

98
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,200
So, there were three of us, I know that now.

99
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,720
You, me and Eurus.

100
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,639
A sister I can't remember.

101
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,480
Interesting name, Eurus. It's Greek, isn't it?

102
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,159
Hm. Yeah, literally, the God of the East Wind.

103
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,679
Yes.

104
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,320
"The east wind is coming, Sherlock."

105
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,440
You used that to scare me.

106
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,240
- No.
- You turned my sister into a ghost story.

107
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,000
Of course I didn't. I monitored you.

108
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,480
You what?

109
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,639
Memories can resurface.

110
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,639
Wounds can reopen.

111
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:14,679
The roads we walk have demons beneath.

112
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,399
And yours have been waiting for a very long time.

113
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:23,519
I never bullied you. I used, at discreet intervals,

114
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,919
potential trigger words

115
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:27,519
to update myself as to your mental condition.

116
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,799
I was looking after you.

117
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,360
Why can't I remember her?

118
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,000
- This is a private matter.
- John stays.

119
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,240
- (This is family!)
- That's why he stays!

120
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:49,639
Hm-hm! So there were three Holmes kids. What was the age gap?

121
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,519
Seven years between myself and Sherlock,

122
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,679
one year between Sherlock and Eurus.

123
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,399
Middle child. Explains a lot.

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,960
- So, did she have it, too?
- Have what?

125
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,559
The deduction thing.

126
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,279
The deduction thing?

127
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,120
- Yes.
- More than you can know.

128
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,799
Enlighten me.

129
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,240
- You realise I'm the smart one?
- As you never cease to announce.

130
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,440
But Eurus, she was incandescent, even then.

131
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,480
Our abilities were professionally assessed more than once.

132
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,440
I was remarkable,

133
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,159
but Eurus was described as an era-defining genius.

134
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,120
Beyond Newton.

135
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,360
Then why don't I remember her?

136
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,960
You do remember her, in a way.

137
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,840
Every choice you ever made, every path you've ever taken,

138
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,440
the man you are today...

139
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,200
..is your memory of Eurus.

140
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,480
She was different from the beginning.

141
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,200
She knew things she should never have known.

142
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,720
As if she was somehow aware of truths beyond the normal scope.

143
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,240
You look funny grown-up.

144
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,960
- What's wrong?
- Sorry.

145
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,320
The memories are disturbing.

146
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,840
What do you mean? Examples.

147
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,639
They found her with a knife once. She seemed to be cutting herself.

148
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,240
Mother and Father were terrified.

149
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,360
They thought it was a suicide attempt.

150
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,440
But when I asked Eurus what she was doing, she said:

151
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,799
I wanted to see how my muscles worked.

152
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,240
- Jesus!
- So I asked her if she felt pain, and she said:

153
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,200
Which one's pain?

154
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,000
Then what happened?

155
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,080
Musgrave.

156
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,960
The ancestral home, where there was always honey for tea.

157
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,279
- And Sherlock played among the funny gravestones.
- Funny how?

158
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,000
Come on, you lot!

159
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,879
They weren't real. The dates were all wrong.

160
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,840
An architectural joke which fascinated Sherlock.

161
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,080
# Deep down below the old beech tree... #

162
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,279
- Help succour me now the...
- East winds blow.

163
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:13,320
- # East winds blow...
- 16 by six.

164
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,879
# 16 by six...#

165
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:17,399
And under we go.

166
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,240
- You're starting to remember.
- Fragments.

167
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,320
Redbeard? Redbeard?

168
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,639
- Redbeard?
- He was my dog.

169
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,679
Eurus took Redbeard and locked him up somewhere no-one could find him.

170
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,320
- Redbeard?
- And she refused to say where he was.

171
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,720
Redbeard?

172
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,840
She'd only repeat that song.

173
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,480
Her little ritual.

174
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,559
- Redbeard?
- We begged and begged her to tell us where he was.

175
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,360
- But she said:
- (The song is the answer.)

176
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,559
But the song made no sense.

177
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,799
# ..Brother, and under we go. #

178
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,039
- What happened to Redbeard?
- We never found him.

179
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:05,720
But she started calling him Drowned Redbeard,

180
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,399
so we made our assumptions.

181
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,919
Sherlock was traumatised.

182
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,039
Natural, I suppose. He was, in the early days, an emotional child.

183
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:19,240
But after that, he was different. So changed.

184
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,200
Never spoke of it again.

185
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,679
In time, he seemed to forget that Eurus had ever even existed.

186
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,679
- How could he forget? She was living in the same house.
- No.

187
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,960
- They took her away.
- Why?

188
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,480
You don't lock up a child because a dog goes missing.

189
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,919
Quite so.

190
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,279
It was what happened immediately afterwards.

191
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,159
FATHER: She knows where he is.

192
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,159
- MOTHER:
- We can't make her tell us.

193
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:52,039
We can't make her do anything!

194
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,080
FLAMES ROAR

195
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,919
- After that, our sister had to be taken away.
- Where?

196
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:22,519
Oh, some suitable place, or so everyone thought.

197
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,720
Not suitable enough, however.

198
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,399
- She died there.
- How?

199
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,120
She started another fire. One which she did not survive.

200
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,360
This is a lie.

201
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,879
Yes.

202
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,879
It is also a kindness.

203
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,879
This is the story I told our parents to spare them further pain,

204
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,559
and to account for the absence of an identifiable body.

205
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,600
And no doubt to prevent their further interference.

206
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,360
Well, that, too, of course.

207
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,080
The depth of Eurus's psychosis and the extent of her abilities

208
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,519
couldn't hope to be contained in any ordinary institution.

209
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,000
Uncle Rudi took care of things.

210
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,519
Where is she, Mycroft? Where's our sister?

211
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,679
There's a place called Sherrinford.

212
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,240
An island.

213
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,120
It's a secure and very secret installation

214
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,759
whose sole purpose is to contain what we call the uncontainables.

215
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,519
The demons beneath the road? This is where we trap them.

216
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,360
Sherrinford is more than a prison, or an asylum.

217
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,759
It is a fortress,

218
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,720
built to keep the rest of the world safe from what is inside it.

219
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Heaven may be a fantasy for the credulous and the afraid.

220
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,360
But I can give you a map reference for hell.

221
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,320
That's where our sister has been since early childhood.

222
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,440
She hasn't left, not for a single day.

223
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,600
Whoever you both met, it can't have been her.

224
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,720
CRASH

225
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,000
# I that am lost Oh, who will find me

226
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,759
# Deep down below the old beech tree?

227
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,799
# Help succour me now the east winds blow

228
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,000
# 16 by six, brother and under we go... #

229
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,840
- Keep back! Keep as still as you can!
- What is it?

230
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,720
# My soul seek the shade of my willow's bloom...#

231
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,480
- It's a drone.
- Yeah, I can see that. What's it carrying?

232
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,759
What's that silver thing on top of it, Mycroft?

233
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:21,039
It's a DX-707.

234
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,240
I've authorised the purchase of quite a number of these.

235
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,200
Colloquially, it is known as the patience grenade.

236
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,679
Patience?

237
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,440
The motion sensor has activated.

238
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,799
- If any of us move, the grenade will detonate.
- How powerful?

239
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,360
It'll certainly destroy this flat and kill anyone in it.

240
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,960
Assuming walls of reasonable strength,

241
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,440
your neighbours should be safe, but as it's landed on the floor,

242
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,000
I am moved to wonder if the cafe below is open.

243
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,679
- It's Sunday morning, so it's closed.
- What about Mrs Hudson?

244
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,799
MUSIC: The Number Of The Beast by Iron Maiden

245
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,320
Going by her usual routine, I estimate she has another two minutes left.

246
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,399
She keeps the vacuum cleaner at the back of the flat.

247
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,079
- So?
- So safer there, when she's putting it away.

248
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,759
But we have to move eventually and we should do it when she's safest.

249
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,759
When the vacuum stops, we give her eight seconds to get to the back of the flat.

250
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:14,759
She's fast when she's cleaning. Then we move.

251
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,759
What's the trigger response time?

252
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:20,720
Once we're mobile, how long before detonation?

253
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,960
We have a maximum of three seconds to vacate the blast radius.

254
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,160
John and I will take the windows, you take the stairs.

255
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,680
- Help get Mrs Hudson out, too.
- Me?

256
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,640
- You're closer.
- You're faster.

257
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,079
Speed differential won't be as critical as the distance.

258
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,200
Yes, agreed.

259
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,240
She's further away. She's moving to the back.

260
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,480
I estimate we have a minute left.

261
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,680
- Is a phone call possible?
- Phone call?

262
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,400
John has a daughter, he may wish to say goodbye.

263
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,400
I'm sorry, Dr Watson, any movement will set off the grenade. I hope you understand.

264
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,359
Oscar Wilde.

265
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,319
- What?
- He said, "The truth is rarely pure and never simple".

266
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:59,599
It's from The Importance Of Being Earnest. We did it at school.

267
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,440
So did we, now I recall.

268
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,400
I was Lady Bracknell.

269
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,680
Yeah. You were great.

270
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,279
- You really think so?
- Yes, I really do.

271
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,279
Well, that's good to know.

272
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:13,160
I've always wondered.

273
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,119
(Good luck, boys.)

274
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:25,960
Three, two, one, go!

Forget you ever heard it.

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,359
- What?
- Sometimes when we're out in these waters, we get that message.

295

- My name's Sherlock Holmes.

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,119
The detective.

00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,720

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,359
I need to speak to Mycroft.

318
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,359
He's in hospital, there was an explosion.

319
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,839
Put me through to the hospital.

320
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:26,319
He's not conscious. He's severely injured.

321
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,160
No-one is even confident he's going to pull through.

322
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,519
Where's his brother? Where's Sherlock Holmes?

323
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,720
Missing.

324
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,640
No, he's not, he's here!

325
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,920
Sir, we found two more from the boat.

326
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,759
'He stole our boat! Him and another fella, with guns!'

327
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,400
- Where'd you find them?
- 'North side of the island, sir.'

328
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,759
- Holding cell, now!
- 'Right, sir.'

330
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,599
This is a mistake!

331
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,039
I'm the victim here, this man stole my boat! He's a pirate.

332
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,319
- Yeah, I really am.
- Please, sit down.

333
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,880
I don't even know who he is!

334
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,880
He's Dr John Watson, formerly of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.

335
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,319
- What are you doing here?
- It's a hospital. Any work?

336
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,720
It's not a hospital.

337
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,359
I want eyes on Eurus Holmes.

338
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,079
Go straight to the special unit,

339
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,920
- deploy green and yellow shift, on my authority.
- Sir.

340
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,559
I'm sparing your blushes because we're supposed to be on the same side.

341
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:29,680
And frankly, this is embarrassing.

342
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,720
Ooh. Doing a cavity search?

343
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,480
The true art of disguise, according to your famous friend,

344
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,079
is not being looked at.

345
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,039
But I am looking at you, aren't I, Mr Holmes?

346
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,279
Yes, you are.

347
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,839
But that is sort of the point, isn't it?

348
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,960
You see, you should have been looking at the guy you just gave your pass to.

349
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,720
Ah!

350
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,279
That's the trouble with uniforms and name badges,

351
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:05,519
people stop looking at faces.

352
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,319
We'd be better off with clown outfits.

353
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,440
At least they'd be satirically relevant.

354
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,880
Oh, you'll find the real Landers on the north shore, tied up with two others.

355
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,279
- Two others?
- Hm. Well, it was trial and error.

356
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,960
We had to find the right waistband.

357
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,119
This is insane! This is unnecessary.

358
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,720
No, your security is compromised and we don't know who to trust.

359
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,240
And that justifies dressing up?

360
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,799
Yes, it does!

361
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,160
It justifies dressing up or any damn thing I say it does!

362
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,960
Now, listen to me, for your own physical safety, do not speak.

363
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,519
Do not indulge in any non-verbal signals

364
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,839
suggestive of internal thought!

365
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,880
If the safety of my sister is compromised,

366
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,200
if the security of my sister is compromised,

367
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,079
if the incarceration of my sister is compromised,

368
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:49,480
in short, if I find any indication my sister has left this island at any time,

369
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,680
I swear to you, you will not!

370
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:56,920
- Say thank you to Dr Watson.
- Why?

371
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,880
He talked me out of Lady Bracknell. This could have been very different.

372
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,440
Are you in?

373
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,039
Just arriving at the secure unit. Explain.

374
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,680
'Door opening.'

375
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,359
Prison within a prison.

376
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,119
Eurus must be allowed the strict minimum of human interaction.

377
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,960
- Why?
- Since you're determined to meet her, you're about to find out.

378
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,440
Eyes on Eurus Holmes. Governor's orders.

379
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,599
Answer yes or no.

380
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,559
Has there ever been, against my express instructions,

381
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,079
any attempt at a psychiatric evaluation of Eurus Holmes?

382
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,759
- Yes.
- I presume the tapes are in my office.

383
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:33,799
- Your office?
- Cast your mind back. It used to be yours.

384
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,000
You haven't been down here before, have you?

385
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,799
Silence Of The Lambs, basically.

386
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,319
- You what?
- Keep your distance.

387
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:43,079
Stay at least three feet away from the glass, and all that.

388
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,559
Why the headphones?

389
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,839
She doesn't stop playing. Sometimes for weeks.

390
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,319
Beautiful.

391
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,640
- Kills you in the end.
- Aye, still beautiful, though.

392
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:56,240
'Door closing.'

393
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,799
VIOLIN PLAYS

394
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,039
SHE STOPS PLAYING

395
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,920
SHE RESUMES PLAYING

396
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,519
'Why am I here?

397
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,119
'Why do you think you're here?

398
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,240
'No-one ever tells me.'

399
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,079
PLAYING CONTINUES

400
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,799
PLAYING SPEEDS UP

401
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:59,519
SLOWS DOWN

402
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,119
- 'Am I being punished?
- You've been bad.

403
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,119
'There's no such thing as bad.

404
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:06,680
- 'What about good?
- Good and bad are fairytales.

405
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,519
'We have evolved to attach an emotional significance

406
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,119
'to what is nothing more than a survival strategy of the pack animal.

407
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:15,640
'We are conditioned to invest divinity in utility.

408
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,799
'Good isn't really good, evil isn't really wrong,

409
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:21,039
'bottoms aren't really pretty. You are a prisoner of your own meat.

410
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,759
'Why aren't you?

411
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:25,279
'I'm too clever.'

412
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,119
MUSIC CONTINUES

413
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,799
- THROUGH SPEAKERS:
- Did you bring it?
- Sorry?

414
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:36,359
My hairband. Did you bring it, like I asked?

415
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:39,519
I'm not one of the... I-I don't work here.

416
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:41,480
My special hairband.

417
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,839
I'm not one of your doctors.

418
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,440
The one I made you steal from Mummy.

419
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,680
It was the last thing I said to you, remember?

420
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,720
The day they took me away.

421
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,160
No.

422
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,000
- No?
- We've spoken since then.

423
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,759
You came round to my flat a few weeks back,

424
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:04,119
you pretended to be a woman called Faith Smith. We had chips.

425
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,920
Does this mean you didn't bring my hairband?

426
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,440
How did you manage to get out of this place? How did you do that?

427
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,920
Easy. Look at me.

428
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,880
I am looking at you.

429
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,039
You can't see it, can you?

430
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,720
You try and try, but you just can't see, you can't look.

431
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,440
See what?

432
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,519
- What do you think?
- Beautiful.

433
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,200
- You're not looking at it.
- I meant your playing.

434
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,400
Oh, the music!

435
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,160
I never know if it's beautiful or not, only if it's right.

436
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,359
Often they're the same thing.

437
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,799
If they're not always the same thing, what's the point in beauty? Look at the violin.

438
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,680
I need to know how you escaped.

439
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,119
Look at the violin.

440
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,240
- It's a Stradivarius.
- It's a gift.

441
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,359
- Who from?
- Me.

442
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,920
- Why?
- You play, don't you?

443
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,799
How did you know?

444
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:14,759
How did I know?

445
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,960
I taught you. Don't you remember? How can you not remember that?

446
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,160
Eurus, I don't remember you at all.

447
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,720
Interesting.

448
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,880
Mycroft told me you'd rewritten your memories,

449
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,079
he didn't tell me you'd written me out completely.

450
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,039
What do you mean, rewritten?

451
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,119
You still don't know about Redbeard, do you?

452
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:37,960
Oh! This is going to be such a good day.

453
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,640
'She smiles at you when you come home...'

454
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,759
Everyone we sent in there, it's hard to describe,

455
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:45,279
- it's...it's like she...
- Recruited them.

456
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,079
'Smiling is advertising.'

457
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,559
Enslaved them.

458
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,279
She's been capable of that since she was five.

459
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,279
She's an adult now.

460
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,799
I warned you. I ordered you.

461
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,200
She's clinically unique. We had to try.

462
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,839
At what cost?

463
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,279
'Happiness is a pop song. Sadness is a poem.'

464
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,640
What cost?

465
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,279
Tell me the worst thing that has happened.

466
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:14,359
She kept suggesting to Dr Taylor that he should kill his family.

467
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,759
- And?
- He said it was like an earworm,

468
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,079
couldn't get her out of his head.

469
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,559
- And?
- He left.

470
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,400
- And?
- Killed himself.

471
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,200
And?

472
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,119
His family.

473
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,640
'Are you going to cry?

474
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,400
'It's OK if you cry.

475
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,960
'I don't want to cry.

476
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,400
'I can help you cry.'

477
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,559
- Play for me.
- I need to know how you got out of here.

478
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:44,920
You know already! Look at me. Look and play.

479
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,160
HE BEGINS TO PLAY

480
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,240
No, not Bach. You clearly don't understand it. Play you.

481
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:59,720
- Me?
- You.

482
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,319
HE BEGINS TO PLAY

483
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,440
Oh! Have you had sex?

484
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,079
Why do you ask?

485
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,559
The music. I've had sex.

486
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,880
- How?
- One of the nurses got careless. I liked it.

487
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,759
Messy, though. People are so breakable.

488
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,400
I take it he didn't consent.

489
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,759
- He?
- She?

490
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,759
Afraid I didn't notice in the heat of the moment.

491
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,640
And afterwards, well, you couldn't really tell.

492
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,440
Is that vibrato, or is your hand shaking?

493
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,240
I warned you explicitly, no-one was to talk to her alone.

494
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,359
- You spoke to her.
- I know what I'm doing!

495
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:39,119
You even brought her a visitor on Christmas Day.

496
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,759
I took a calculated risk.

497
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:43,279
You gave her a Christmas present.

498
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,880
Remember her Christmas present?

499
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,799
I am aware of the dangers Eurus poses

500
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:49,519
and equipped to deal with them.

501
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,799
What dangers?

502
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:56,640
Eurus doesn't just talk to people, she...reprograms them.

503
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,279
Anyone who spends time with her is automatically compromised.

504
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,240
'I'm only trying to help you. We can help each other.

505
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,319
'Helping someone is the best way you can help yourself.

506
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:09,200
'I don't trust you.'

507
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,799
So, clearly you remember me?

508
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,839
I remember everything. Every single thing.

509
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,240
You just need a big enough hard drive.

510
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,759
- WATSON: 'Sherlock?'
- Not now.

511
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:21,559
- 'Vatican Cameos.'
- In a minute.

512
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:24,039
Let's continue.

513
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:26,160
Did they tell you to keep three feet from the glass?

514
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,279
- Yes.
- Be naughty, step closer.

515
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,160
- Why?
- Do it. Step closer.

516
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,880
Tell me what you remember.

517
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,799
You, me and Mycroft.

518
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,720
Mycroft was quite clever. He could understand things if you went a bit slow,

519
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,279
but you, you were my favourite.

520
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:50,720
Why was I your favourite?

521
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,599
Because I could make you laugh. I loved it when you laughed.

522
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:56,799
Once, I made you laugh all night, I thought you were going to burst.

523
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,519
I was so happy.

524
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,960
Then Mummy and Daddy had to stop me, of course.

525
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,039
- Why?
- Well, turns out I'd got it wrong.

526
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:06,000
Apparently, you were screaming.

527
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,839
Why was I screaming?

528
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,680
FAINT WHIMPERING

529
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,799
(Redbeard!)

530
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,720
- I remember Redbeard.
- Do you now?

531
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,400
Tell me what I don't know.

532
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,920
Touch the glass.

533
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,440
I put my trust in you, my implicit trust,

534
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,240
as governor of this institute!

535
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,119
GULLS CRY

536
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,319
WAVES CRASH

537
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,839
It's obvious when it all started.

538
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,319
Well, she was never the same after that Christmas.

539
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,640
It's as if you woke her up.

540
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,200
That is entirely beside the point!

541
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,680
- You had your orders and failed to act on them.
- Listen to the tape.

542
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,720
- Sorry?
- Do it now, listen.

543
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,920
- My sister's methods of...
- Just listen.

544
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,880
'You have no idea how I could help.

545
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,039
'Bring me your wife. I want to meet her.

546
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:05,359
- MAN:
- 'I don't need your help.'

547
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,559
Redbeard was my dog.

548
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,559
I know what happened to Redbeard.

549
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:13,680
Oh, Sherlock, you know nothing.

550
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,119
Touch the glass and I'll tell you the truth.

551
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,200
I'll touch it, too, if you're scared.

552
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,440
'I can fix her for you and then I'll give you her straight back,

553
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,599
'good as new, I promise.

554
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:32,599
'That's all. What you're proposing is not... It's not...right.'

555
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,880
Everyone who went in there got affected.

556
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,920
- Enslaved, you said.
- Yes.

557
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,480
- One after the other?
- Yes.

558
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,799
- Dr Watson, I think we've...
- Shut up!

559
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:43,319
- EURUS:
- 'Do you trust your wife?'

560
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:45,359
One question, that's your voice, isn't it?

561
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,759
'Do you really? Do you trust her?

562
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,680
'You've got to stop saying these things.'

563
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,160
If Eurus has enslaved you, then who exactly is in charge of this prison?

564
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,079
'It's completely inappropriate.'

565
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:57,000
I'm sorry.

566
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,799
- No!
- Very, very sorry.

567
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,559
No! ALARM WAILS

568
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,079
You think it's a trick.

569
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:16,559
You look so unsure.

570
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:18,760
You're not used to being unsure, are you?

571
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,719
It's more common than you'd think.

572
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,239
Look at you.

573
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,800
The man who sees through everything

574
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,679
is exactly the man who doesn't notice...

575
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,039
..when there's nothing to see through.

576
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:41,480
Do you see how it was done? I know you like explanations.

577
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,800
The signs, you suspended the signs!

578
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,760
And my voice? Throat mic.

579
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,159
Puts me through the speakers.

- Don't you think it's clever?

581
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:54,159
- Simple, but clever.
- Transparent.

582
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,559
Well, you do keep asking me how I got out of here.

583
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:04,119
Like this.

584
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:06,159
Ooof! Argh!

585
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:08,800
A-A-A-A-A-A-Argh!

586
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,760

- Mr Moriarty.
- Big G.

612
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,760
Big G means Governor. Street speak.

613
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,199
I'm a bit down with the kids, you know.

614
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm relatable that way.

615
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,159
Do you like my boys?

616
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:02,559
This one's got more stamina, but he's less caring in the afterglow.

617
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,000
This way, please.

618
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:25,000
Smell all that insane criminality.

620
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,280
Do you have cannibals here?

621
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,840
- Yes.
- How many?
- Three.
- That's good.

622
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,039
People leave their bodies to science,

623
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:36,840
I think cannibals would be so much more grateful.

Ah!

00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,400
HE CHUCKLES

628
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,960
Ah! Isn't that sweet?

629
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,639
Won't you sit down?

630
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:13,280
I wrote my own version of the Nativity when I was a child.

631
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,039
The Hungry Donkey.

632
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:19,320
It was a bit gory, but if you're going to put a baby in a manger,

633
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,920
you're asking for trouble.

634
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,280
- You know what this place is, of course?
- Of course.

635
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,519
So, am I under arrest again?

636
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,239
You remain a person of interest,

637
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:33,239
but until you commit a verifiable crime,

638
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:35,599
you are, I regret, at liberty.

639
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,320
- Then why am I here?
- You're a Christmas present.

640
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,559
Ah. How do you want me?

641
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,000
There is, in this facility,

642
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,639
a prisoner whose intellectual abilities

643
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:49,440
are of occasional use to the British government.

644
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,199
What, for, like, really difficult sums, long division, that sort of thing?

645
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:56,400
She predicted the exact dates of the last three terrorist attacks

646
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,000
on the British mainland after an hour on Twitter.

647
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,960
That sort of thing.

648
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,800
In return, however, she requires treats.

649
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,639
Last year, it was a violin.

650
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:07,880
This year?

651
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:14,159
Five minutes unsupervised conversation...with you.

652
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,559
Me?

653
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,760
With me?

654
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,440
She has noted your interest in the activities of my little brother.

655
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,159
So, what has she got to do with Sherlock Holmes?

656
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,679
Whatever you're about to tell me...

657
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:42,239
..I already know it's going to be...awesome!

658
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,639
I'm your Christmas present.

659
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,960
So, what's mine?

660
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,760
Redbeard.

How are you?

00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,159
- Bit of a lump.
- True, that, but you have your uses.

664
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,920
- Did you see your sister?
- Yes.

665
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,440
- How was that?
- Family is always difficult.

666
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,000
Is this an occasion for banter?

667
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,519

- Apparently.

- As he is told.

Oh, hello. Um...try...try to stay calm.

Just...tell me...tell me what your name is.

I'm not supposed to tell my name to strangers.

Of course not, very good. But, um...I'll tell you mine.

Oh, dear. We seem to have lost the connection.

How have you done this? How is any of this possible?

693
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:19,480
You put me in here, Mycroft, you brought me my treats.

694

What treats?

695
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,000
'Clever, Eurus! You go, girl!'

696
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,239
How can that be Moriarty?

697
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:36,880
Oh, he recorded lots of little messages for me before he died.

698
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,800
Loved it. Did you know his brother was a stationmaster?

699
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,639
I think he was always jealous.

700
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:43,559
The girl, where is she?

701
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:45,320
Can I talk to her again?

702
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,840
Poor little thing.

703
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,079
Alone in the sky in a great big plane with nowhere to land.

704
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:52,840
But where in the world is she?

705
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,400
It's a clever little puzzle.

706
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,119
If you want to apply yourself to it, I can reconnect you,

707
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,599
but first...

708
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,280
That's my wife.

709
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,559
That's my wife!

710
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:10,280
Oh, God, that's my wife!

711
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,840
I'm going to shoot the governor's wife.

712
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,000
Please! No!

713
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,679
Please! Help her!

714
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:20,000
In about a minute...bang! Dead!

715
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,159
- Please don't do that.
- Well, you can stop me.

716
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:26,199
- How?
- There's a gun in the hatch. Take it.

717
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,599
You want to save the governor's wife,

718
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:35,320
choose either Dr Watson or Mycroft to kill the governor.

719
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,599
Oh! Oh, God!

720
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:44,800
You can't do it, Sherlock. If you do it, it won't count. I'll kill her, anyway.

721
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,559
It has to be your brother or your friend.

722
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,079
You have to do this.

723
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:53,960
Eurus will kill her!

724
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,559
It doesn't appear we have a choice.

725
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:01,199
Right, then. Countdown's starting.

726
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:04,440
How long?

727
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,559
No, no, no, the countdown is for me.

728
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,360
Withholding the precise deadline will apply the emotional pressure more evenly.

729
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:15,119
Where possible, please give me an explicit verbal indication of your anxiety levels,

730
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,519
I can't always read them from your behaviour.

731
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:19,519
I can't do this.

732
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:21,320
I can't, it's murder.

733
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,079
This is not murder, this is saving my wife.

734
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,039
I'm particularly focused on internal conflicts,

735
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,400
where strategising around a largely-intuitive moral code

736
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,360
appears to create a counterintuitive result.

737
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,199
I will not kill.

738
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,159
I will not have blood on my hands!

739
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:39,239
Yes, very good. Thank you.

740
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:41,440
Killing my wife is what you are doing.

741
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,960
No!

742
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:47,719
OK, fine.

743
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:50,800
John?

744
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,159
Dr Watson, are you married?

745
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,559
I was.

746
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:59,360
- What happened?
- She died.

747
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:02,639
What would you give to get her back?

748
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:04,239
I mean, if you could, if it was possible,

749
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:06,320
what would you do to save her?

750
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,599
Eurus will kill me.

751
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:11,199
Please save my wife.

752
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:13,760
There will, I'm afraid, be regular prompts

753
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,679
to create an atmosphere of urgency.

754
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:19,400
- MORIARTY:
- 'Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

755
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,039
'Tick-tick-tick-tick, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.'

756
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,400
What's your name?

757
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,760
David.

758
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,239
And you're sure about this, David?

759
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:40,760
Of course I'm bloody sure!

760
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,039
Nearly there.

761
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,199
Right, do you want to pray or anything?

762
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:48,559
With Eurus Holmes in the world, who the hell would I pray to?

763
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,119
You are a good man and you are doing a good thing.

764
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:53,440
So are you.

765
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,760
I'll spend the rest of my life telling myself that.

766
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:06,880
Please!

767
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,920
Oh, God!

768
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,239
I know that you're scared, but you should also be very proud.

769
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:33,320
Just do it! Be quick!

770
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,880
- MORIARTY:
- 'Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.'

771
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,239
This is very good, Dr Watson.

772
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:43,119
I should have fitted you with a cardiograph.

773
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,760
Goodbye, David.

774
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:49,639
'Tock-tock-tock-tock-tock-tock-tock, tick-tick-tick.'

775
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,159
- SOBS:
- Please!

776
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:57,119
I can't. I'm sorry, I can't do it.

777
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,760
I know, it's all right.

778
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,639
Stop! No, no! Stop!

779
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,079
I'm sorry.

780
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,840
- It's all right. - I'm so sorry!

781
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,320
Remember me.

782
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,360
- No!
- No!
- GUNSHOT

783
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:14,280
Oh!

784
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,840
HE VOMITS

785
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,639
Are you all right?

786
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:21,239
Interesting.

787
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:25,519
All right, there you go, you got what you wanted, and he's dead.

788
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:29,679
Dead or alive, he really wasn't very interesting.

789
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:32,960
But you three, you three were wonderful.

790
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,639
Thank you.

791
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,320
You see, what you did, Dr Watson, specifically because of your moral code,

792
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,639
because you don't want blood on your hands,

793
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:44,800
two people are dead instead of one.

794
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,000
Two people?

795
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,960
Yes. Sorry.

796
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,480
Hang on.

797
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:53,199
GUNSHOT

798
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:54,559
Oh!

799
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,519
HE EXHALES

800
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,639
What advantage did your moral code grant you?

801
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:07,559
Is it not, in the end, selfish to keep one's hands clean

802
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:09,320
at the expense of another's life?

803
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,039
You didn't have to kill her!

804
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:13,920
Huh! The condition of her survival

805
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,119
was that you or Mycroft had to kill her husband.

806
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:20,400
This is an experiment.

807
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,320
There will be rigour.

808
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,400
Sherlock, pick up the gun. It's your turn next.

809
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,119
When I tell you to use it, and I will,

810
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:30,440
remember what happened this time.

811
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,159
What if I don't want a gun?

812
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,360
Oh, the gun is intended as a mercy.

813
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,119
- For whom?
- You.

814
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:37,840
- How so?
- If someone else had to die,

815
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,400
would you really want to do it with your bare hands?

816
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,440
It would waste valuable time.

817
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:50,000
Probably just take it.

818
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,920
There's only one bullet left.

819
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,679
You will only need one.

820
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:03,519
But you WILL need it.

821
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:04,559
DOOR OPENS

822
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,960
Please, go through.

823
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,320
There's a few tasks for you

824
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,360
and a girl on a plane is getting very, very scared.

825
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,639
Treats?

826
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:22,960
Yes. You know, a violin.

827
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,039
In exchange for?

828
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:26,719
She's very clever.

829
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:28,639
I'm beginning to think you're not.

830
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:33,719
- MORIARTY:
- 'Come on now, all aboard!

831
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:38,239
'Choo-choo! Choo-choo! Choo-choo!

832
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:42,039
'Choo-choo! Choo-choo!

833
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:44,280
'Choo-choo!

834
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,800
'Choo-choo! Choo-choo!'

835
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,960
Someone's been redecorating.

836
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,800
- Is that allowed?
- She's literally taken over the asylum,

837
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,519
we have more to worry about than her choice of colour scheme.

838
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:57,800
Barely dry. Recent.

839
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,639
And it's for our benefit.

840
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:02,840
As a motivator to your continued cooperation,

841
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,360
I'm now reconnecting you.

842
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:10,199
'Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night.'

843
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:11,719
- GIRL:
- 'Are...are you still there?'

844
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:13,519
Yes, hello?

845
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:15,800
Hello, we're still here, can you hear us?

846
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,760
- Yes.
- 'Everything is going to be all right,

847
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,760
'I-I just need you to tell me where you are.

848
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,840
'Outside, is it day or night?'

849
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,480
- Night.
- That certainly narrows it down to half the planet(!)

850
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,880
- What kind of a plane are you on?
- 'I don't know.'

851
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,159
- Is it big or small?
- 'Big.'
- Lots of people on it?

852
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:33,960
Lots and lots, but they're all asleep, I can't wake them up.

853
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,880
- Where did you take off from?
- 'And the driver's asleep.'

854
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,840
No, I understand, but where did you come from?

855
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,239
'Where did the plane take off?'

856
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:43,639
- My nan's.
- And where are you going?

857
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:45,559
- 'Home.'
- No, I mean what airport...

858
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:48,199
Enough for now. Time to play a new game.

859
00:50:48,199 --> 00:50:52,000
Look on the table in front of you. Open the envelope.

860
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,480
If you want to speak to the girl again,

861
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,719
earn yourself some phone time!

862
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:58,719
This is inhuman, this is insane!

863
00:50:58,719 --> 00:50:59,920
Mycroft, we know!

864
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:04,039
Six months ago, a man called Evans was murdered.

865
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:05,880
Unsolved, except by me.

866
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,840
He was shot from a distance of 300 metres with this rifle.

867
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:13,639
Now, if the police had any brains,

868
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:16,400
they'd realise there are three suspects, all brothers,

869
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,639
Nathan Garrideb, Alex Garrideb and Howard Garrideb.

870
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:22,440
All these photos are up to date,

871
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:27,199
but which one pulled the trigger, Sherlock?

872
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:29,239
Which one?

873
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:32,800
What's this, we're supposed to solve this based on what?

874
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,119
This. This is all we get.

875
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:36,920
Please, make use of your friends, Sherlock.

876
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,079
I want to see you interact with people that you're close to.

877
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,960
Also, you may have to choose which one to keep.

878
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:47,400
- What do you make of it?
- Am I being asked to prove my usefulness?

879
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,599
Yes, I should think you are.

880
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:50,599
I will not be manipulated like this.

881
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:52,480
Fine. John? John!

882
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,000
Yeah, I think I've seen one of these. It's a buffalo gun.

883
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,360
I'd say 1940s, old-fashioned sight. No crosshairs.

884
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,760
Glasses, glasses. Nathan wears glasses.

885
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,400
Evans was shot from 300 metres.

886
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,480
The kickback from a gun with this calibre...

887
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,960
..would be massive.

888
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,880
No cuts, no scarring.

889
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,519
It's not Nathan, then. Who's next?

890
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:21,360
Well done, Dr Watson. How useful you are.

891
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,559
Do you have a suspicion we're being made to compete?

892
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:26,599
We're not competing. There's a plane in the air that's going to crash,

893
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:28,880
so what we're doing is trying to save a little girl.

894
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,480
Today, we have to be soldiers, Mycroft, soldiers.

895
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,639
And that means to hell with what happens to us!

896
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,920
Your priorities do you credit.

897
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,159
No, my priorities just got a woman killed.

898
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:41,239
Now, as I understand it, Sherlock,

899
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:44,280
you try to repress your emotions to refine your reasoning.

900
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,920
I'd like to see how that works. So, if you don't mind,

901
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,000
I'm going to apply some context to your deductions.

902
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,920
Oh, dear God!

903
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,239
Two of the Garridebs work here as orderlies,

904
00:52:57,239 --> 00:53:00,199
so getting the third along really wasn't too difficult.

905
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:05,760
Once you bring in your verdict, let me know and justice will be done.

906
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,639
- Justice?
- What will you do with them?

907
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:09,320
Early release.

908
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,719
You'll drop them into the sea.

909
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:12,239
Sink or swim.

910
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:13,639
They're tied up!

911
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:16,039
Exactly! Now there is context.

912
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:18,519
Please continue with your deductions.

913
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:21,360
I'm now focusing on the difference to your mental capacity

914
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,480
a specified consequence can make.

915
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,840
Why should we bother?

916
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,000
What if we're disinclined to play your games, little sister?

917
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,400
Hm-hm! I have, if you remember,

918
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,639
provided you with some motivation.

919
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:36,760
- GIRL:
- 'We're going through the clouds, like cotton wool.'

920
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,559
Oh, that's nice. Try to tell me more about the plane.

921
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:41,400
Why won't my mummy wake up?

922
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,000
CALL DISCONNECTS

923
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,719
So it's got to be one of the other two. Now, Howard...

924
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:51,039
Howard's a lifelong drunk, pallor of his skin,

925
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:53,119
terminal gin blossoms on his red nose.

926
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,079
And, terror notwithstanding, a bad case of the DTs.

927
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:03,199
There's no way he could have taken that shot from 300 metres way.

928
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:04,840
So that leaves us with Alex.

929
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,599
Indentations on the temples suggest he habitually wears glasses.

930
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,519
Frown lines suggest a lifetime of peering.

931
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:10,960
He's short-sighted, or he was.

932
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,840
His recent laser surgery has done the trick.

933
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,880
- Laser surgery?
- Look at his clothes, he's made an effort.

934
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,840
- That's very good.
- Excellent.

935
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,039
Suddenly he sees himself in quite a different light now that he's dumped the specs.

936
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:22,360
He even has a spray tan.

937
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:25,320
But he's clearly not used to his new personal grooming ritual.

938
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:29,239
That can be told by the state of his fingernails and the fact that there's hair growing in his ears.

939
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:31,320
So it's a superficial job, then.

940
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,360
But he got his eyes fixed, his hands were steady.

941
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,400
He pulled the trigger. He killed Evans.

942
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,599
Are you ready to condemn the prisoner?

943
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,400
Sherlock, we can't do this.

944
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,800
The plane, remember?

945
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,559
Sherlock, are you ready?

946
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,400
Alex.

947
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,400
Say it. Condemn him.

948
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,079
Condemn him in the knowledge of what will happen to the man you name.

949
00:54:57,559 --> 00:54:59,119
I condemn Alex Garrideb.

950
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:02,840
- MORIARTY:
- 'Mind the gap.'

951
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,480
Congratulations, you got the right one.

952
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,920
Now, go through the door.

953
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,199
You dropped the other two, why?

954
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:11,039
- Interesting.
- Why?!

955
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:12,639
Does it really make a difference,

956
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,079
killing the innocent instead of the guilty?

957
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:16,719
Let's see.

958
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:19,960
'The train has left the station!'

959
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,119
No. That felt pretty much the same.

960
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,159
John?

961
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:28,280
- Don't let her distract you.
- Distract me?
- Soldiers today.

962
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:52,840
One more minute on the phone.

963
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,920
- GIRL:
- 'I'm frightened! I'm really frightened!'

964
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,119
It's OK, don't worry. I don't have very long with you,

965
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,079
so I just need you tell me what you can see outside the plane.

966
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,599
Just the sea. I can see the sea.

967
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:05,039
- Are there ships on it?
- 'No ships.

968
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:06,920
'I can see lights in the distance.'

969
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,920
- Is it a city?
- 'I think so.'

970
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,400
She's about to fly over a city in a pilotless plane.

971
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,760
We'll have to talk her through it.

972
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,360
- Through what?
- 'Hello? Are you still there?'

973
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,199
Still here. Just give us a minute.

974
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:19,960
Getting the plane away from any mainland, any populated areas.

975
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,360
- It has to crash in the sea.
- What about the girl?

976
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:25,639
Well, obviously, Dr Watson, she's the one who's going to crash it.

977
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:27,440
No. We could help her land it.

978
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,679
And if we fail and she crashes into a city?

979
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:30,880
How many will die then?

980
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,519
How are we going to get her to do that?

981
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:35,719
I'm afraid we're going to have to give her hope.

982
00:56:35,719 --> 00:56:37,800
Is there really no-one there that can help you?

983
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,920
Have you really, really checked?

984
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,639
Everyone's asleep. Will you help me?

985
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:44,239
We're going to do everything that we can.

986
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:46,280
'I'm scared. I'm really scared!'

987
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,559
It's all right, I...

988
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:50,880
- EURUS:
- Now, back to the matter in hand. Coffin.

989
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,519
Problem, someone is about to die.

990
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:55,800
It will be, as I understand it, a tragedy.

991
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,519
So many days not lived,

992
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:02,719
so many words unsaid, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera...

993
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,199
Yes, yes, yes, and this, I presume, will be their coffin.

994
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:07,679
Whose coffin, Sherlock?

995
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:10,360
Please, start your deductions.

996
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,360
I will apply some context in a moment.

997
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,480
Well, allowing for the entirely pointless courtesy of headroom,

998
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,719
I'd say this coffin is intended for someone of about five foot four.

999
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:20,559
- Makes it more likely to be a woman.
- Not a child?

1000
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,199
A child's would be more expensive. This is in the lower price range,

1001
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:25,239
although still best available in that bracket.

1002
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:26,800
That was a lonely night on Google.

1003
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,679
This is a practical and informed choice.

1004
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:31,519
The balance of probability suggests that this is for an unmarried woman,

1005
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:33,079
distant from her close relatives.

1006
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:36,239
That is suggested by the economy of choice, acquainted with the process of death,

1007
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:39,480
but unsentimental about the necessity of disposal. The lining of the coffin...

1008
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,199
Yes, very good, Sherlock, or we could just look at the name on the lid.

1009
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:48,039
Only it isn't a name.

1010
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:50,960
So it's for somebody who loves somebody.

1011
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,880
It's for somebody who loves Sherlock.

1012
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,159
This is all about you, everything here.

1013
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,960
So, who loves you?

1014
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,119
I'm assuming it's not a long list.

1015
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:03,119
- Irene Adler.
- Don't be ridiculous. Look at the coffin.

1016
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,239
Unmarried, practical about death, alone.

1017
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:12,559
- Molly.
- Molly Hooper.

1018
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,760
She's perfectly safe, for the moment.

1019
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,599
Her flat is rigged to explode in approximately three minutes,

1020
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:20,960
unless I hear the release code from her lips.

1021
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,599
I'm calling her on your phone, Sherlock.

1022
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:25,400
- Make her say it.
- Say what?

1023
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,679
- Obvious, surely.
- No.
- Yes.

1024
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,639
Oh, one important restriction, you're not allowed to mention

1025
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:35,599
in any way at all that her life is in danger.

1026
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,920
You may not, at any point, suggest that there is any form of crisis.

1027
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,719
If you do, I will end this session and her life.

1028
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:43,039
Are we clear?

1029
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:46,199
- MORIARTY:
- 'Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock,

1030
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:48,760
'tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tick...'

1031
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,400
PHONE RINGS

1032
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,559
- What's she doing?
- She's making tea.

1033
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:02,199
But why isn't she answering her phone?

1034
00:59:02,199 --> 00:59:03,440
You never answer your phone.

1035
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,320
Yes, but it's me calling.

1036
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,960
- ANSWERPHONE:
- 'Hi, this is Molly at the dead centre of town.

1037
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,159
'Leave a message.'

00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:20,000
OK, OK. Just one more time.

PHONE RINGS

1043
00:59:37,639 --> 00:59:41,639
'Hello, Sherlock. Is this urgent? Because I'm not having a good day.'

1044
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:45,320
Molly, I just want you to do something very easy for me and not ask why.

1045
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,920
Oh, God! Is this one of your stupid games?

1046
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,519
No, it's not a game. I need you to help me.

1047
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:54,679
- Look, I'm not at the lab.
- It's not about that.

1048
00:59:54,679 --> 00:59:56,960
Well, quickly, then.

1049
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,880
Sherlock! What is it, what do you want?

1050
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,760
'Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock...'

1051
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,159
Molly, please, without asking why, just say these words.

1052
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:08,559
What words?

1053
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:09,960
I love you.

1054
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,000
- Leave me alone.
- Molly, no, please, no! Don't hang up! Do not hang up!

1055
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,079
Calmly, Sherlock, or I will finish her right now.

1056
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:19,440
Why are you doing this to me?!

1057
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,719
Why are you making fun of me?!

1058
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:22,920
Please, I swear, you just have to listen to me.

1059
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,800
Softer, Sherlock.

1060
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,719
Molly, this is for a case.

1061
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:29,599
It's...it's a sort of experiment.

1062
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,639
I'm not an experiment, Sherlock.

1063
01:00:31,639 --> 01:00:34,199
No, I know you're not an experiment, you're my friend.

1064
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:38,280
We're friends, but, please, just say those words for me.

1065
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:43,039
Please don't do this. Just...just...don't do it.

1066
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,119
It's very important.

1067
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:46,599
I can't say why.

1068
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:48,199
But I promise you, it is.

1069
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:51,360
I can't say that, I can't...I can't say that to you.

1070
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,400
Of course you can. Why can't you?

1071
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,760
'You know why.'

1072
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,559
No, I don't know why.

1073
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:57,960
SHE SIGHS

1074
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,320
Of course you do.

1075
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,039
'Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock,

1076
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:03,760
'tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.'

1077
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,280
Please, just say it.

1078
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:09,519
'I can't. Not to you.'

1079
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:11,039
Why?

1080
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:14,400
Because...because it's true.

1081
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,360
Because...it's true, Sherlock.

1082
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,159
It's always been true.

1083
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,239
Well, if it's true, just say it anyway.

1084
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,239
You bastard!

1085
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:29,679
'Say it anyway.'

1086
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:34,440
'You say it. Go on. You say it first.'

1087
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,199
- What?
- Say it. Say it like you mean it.

1088
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,320
Final 30 seconds.

1089
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:49,480
I...

1090
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,119
..I love you.

1091
01:01:58,159 --> 01:01:59,519
I love you.

1092
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,320
Molly?

1093
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,599
Molly, please!

1094
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,440
I love you.

1095
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,480
BEEPING

HE EXHALES

1097
01:02:31,639 --> 01:02:33,280
Sherlock, however hard that was...

1098
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,480
Eurus, I won. I won.

1099
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,760
Come on, play fair. The girl on the plane, I need to talk to her.

1100
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:43,880
I won! I saved Molly Hooper!

1101
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,840
Huh!

1102
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,079
Saved her? From what?

1103
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,519
Oh, do be sensible, there were no explosives in her little house.

1104
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:53,639
Why would I be so clumsy?

1105
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:55,960
You didn't win, you lost.

1106
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,440
Look what you did to her. Look what you did to yourself.

1107
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,480
All those complicated little emotions, I lost count.

1108
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:05,800
Emotional context, Sherlock, it destroys you every time.

1109
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:09,679
Now, please, pull yourself together. I need you at peak efficiency.

1110
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:11,800
The next one isn't going to be so easy.

1111
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:14,840
In your own time.

1112
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:34,079
- Sherlock?
- No. No!

1113
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:38,360
No! No! No! Argh!

1114
01:03:42,199 --> 01:03:45,039
No! No! No!

1115
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:49,119
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Argh!

1116
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:57,480
THUNDERCLAP

1117
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,960
WIND WHISTLES

1118
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,280
Hm-hm.

1119
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:12,599
I know this is difficult, and I know you're being tortured,

1120
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,400
but you have got to keep it together.

1121
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,239
This isn't torture, this is vivisection.

1122
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:20,440
We're experiencing science from the perspective of lab rats.

1123
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,079
Huh!

1124
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:28,559
- Soldiers?
- Soldiers.

1125
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:36,960
WATSON EXHALES

1126
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,280
- MORIARTY:
- 'Tick-tock! Tickets, please!'

1127
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,599
Hey, Sis, don't mean to complain, but this one's empty.

1128
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:44,920
What happened, did you run out of ideas?

1129
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,400
It's not empty, Sherlock. You've still got the gun, haven't you?

1130
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,280
I told you you'd need it, because only two can play the next game.

1131
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,400
Just two of you go on from here.

1132
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,280
Your choice, it's make-your-mind-up time.

1133
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:59,639
Whose help do you need the most, John or Mycroft?

1134
01:04:59,639 --> 01:05:02,039
It's an elimination round.

1135
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:04,559
You choose one and kill the other.

1136
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,840
You have to choose, family or friend.

1137
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,079
Mycroft or John Watson?

1138
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:11,800
'Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick...'

1139
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,920
- Eurus, enough!
- Not yet, I think, but nearly.

1140
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,880
Remember, there's a plane in the sky and it's not going to land.

1141
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,599
- Well?
- Well, what?

1142
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:27,880
We're not actually going to discuss this, are we?

1143
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,639
I'm sorry, Dr Watson, you're a fine man in many respects.

1144
01:05:31,639 --> 01:05:33,559
Make your goodbyes and shoot him.

1145
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,159
- Shoot him!
- What?

1146
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:39,400
Shoot Dr Watson.

1147
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:43,679
There's no question who has to continue from here, it's us. You and me.

1148
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,360
Whatever lies ahead requires brainpower, Sherlock,

1149
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,880
not sentiment.

1150
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,639
Don't prolong his agony, shoot him.

1151
01:05:49,639 --> 01:05:51,280
Do I get a say in this?

1152
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,000
Today, we are soldiers. Soldiers die for their country.

1153
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,159
I regret, Dr Watson, that privilege is now yours.

1154
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,599
Shit, he's right.

1155
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,800
He is, in fact, right.

1156
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,000
Make it swift. No need to prolong his agony.

1157
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,199
Get it over with and we can get to work.

1158
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:16,719
Huh! Hm-hm!

1159
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:19,920
Oh, God! I should have expected this.

1160
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,559
Pathetic. You always were the slow one. The idiot.

1161
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:25,280
That's why I've always despised you.

1162
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,360
You shame us all. You shame the family name.

1163
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,440
Now, for once in your life, do the right thing.

1164
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,480
Put this stupid little man out of all our misery.

1165
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:36,760
Shoot him!

1166
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,239
- Stop it.
- Look at him. What is he?

1167
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:42,000
Nothing more than a distraction, a little scrap of ordinariness

1168
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,400
for you to impress, to dazzle with your cleverness.

1169
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,599
You'll find another.

1170
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:49,400
- Please, for God's sake, just stop it.
- Why?

1171
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,440
Because, on balance, even your Lady Bracknell was more convincing.

1172
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,440
Ignore everything he just said, he's being kind.

1173
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,760
He's trying to make it easy for me to kill him.

1174
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,360
Which is why this is going to be so much harder.

1175
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,719
You said you liked my Lady Bracknell.

1176
01:07:07,719 --> 01:07:09,360
Sherlock, don't.

1177
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,679
It's not your decision, Dr Watson.

1178
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:14,039
Not in the face, though, please.

1179
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:15,840
I promised my brain to the Royal Society.

1180
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,320
Where would you suggest?

1181
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:21,320
Well, I suppose there is a heart somewhere inside me.

1182
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:24,159
I don't imagine it's much of a target,

1183
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:27,440
but why don't we try for that?

1184
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,880
I won't allow this.

1185
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,400
This is my fault. Moriarty.

1186
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,440
- Moriarty?
- Her Christmas treat.

1187
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,760
Five minutes' conversation with Jim Moriarty five years ago.

1188
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,159
What did they discuss?

1189
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,199
Five minutes' conversation...

1190
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,000
..unsupervised.

1191
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,199
SHERLOCK SIGHS

1192
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:01,039
Goodbye, brother mine.

1193
01:08:04,679 --> 01:08:05,719
No flowers.

1194
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,559
My request.

1195
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:17,359
Jim Moriarty thought you'd make this choice. He was so excited.

1196
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:22,960
'And here we are, the end of the line.

1197
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,319
'Holmes killing Holmes.'

1198
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:33,119
'This is where I get off.'

1199
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,960
Five minutes.

1200
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,359
It took her just five minutes to do all of this to us.

1201
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,319
Well, not on my watch.

1202
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:55,960
What are you doing?

1203
01:08:57,159 --> 01:08:59,800
A moment ago, a brave man asked to be remembered.

1204
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,359
I'm remembering the governor.

1205
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:05,159
- Ten...
- No! No, Sherlock...

1206
01:09:05,159 --> 01:09:08,319
- ..nine, eight...
- You can't!

1207
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:10,840
- ..seven...
- You don't know about Redbeard yet!

1208
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:13,039
- ..six...
- Sherlock!
- ..five...

1209
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:15,640
- Sherlock, stop that at once!
- POPPING

1210
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,279
..four...

1211
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,760
..three...

1212
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,960
..two...

1213
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,439
- GIRL:
- 'Hello?

1214
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,439
'Hello? Are you still there?'

1215
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:48,720
Yes, yeah, no, I'm...I'm still here. I'm here.

1216
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,880
You went away. You said you'd help me and you went away.

1217
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,840
Yes, I know. Well, I'm sorry about that.

1218
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:56,000
We...we...we must have got cut off. Um...

1219
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,359
How...how...how long was I away?

1220
01:10:00,359 --> 01:10:01,880
Hours. Hours and hours.

1221
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,239
Why don't grown-ups tell the truth?

1222
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:08,000
No, I-I am telling the truth. You can trust me.

1223
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,840
'Where did you go?'

1224
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,119
I'm not completely sure.

1225
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:14,680
Um...now, I tell you what,

1226
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:17,520
you...you've got to be really, really brave for me.

1227
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,359
Can you go to the front of the plane? Can you do that?

1228
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:23,479
- 'The front?'
- Yes, that's right, the front.

1229
01:10:23,479 --> 01:10:26,680
- 'You mean where the driver is?'
- Yes, that's it.

1230
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,239
OK. I'm going.

1231
01:10:32,119 --> 01:10:34,920
- Are you there yet?
- Yeah, I'm here.

1232
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,640
- John?
- Yeah?
- Where are you?

1233
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,119
I don't know. I've just woken up. Where are you?

1234
01:10:40,119 --> 01:10:42,960
I'm in another cell. I just spoke to the girl on the plane again.

1235
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,119
- We've been out for hours.
- What, she's still up there?

1236
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:47,960
Yes. The plane will keep flying until it runs out of fuel.

1237
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,439
- Is Mycroft with you?
- I have no idea, I can hardly see anything.

1238
01:10:50,439 --> 01:10:52,399
Mycroft? Mycroft?

1239
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,039
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1240
01:10:56,039 --> 01:10:58,560
Keep exploring. Tell me anything you can about where you are.

1241
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,399
The walls are...rough. They're rock, I guess.

1242
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:03,039
What are you standing on?

1243
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:06,720
Er...stone, I think, but, listen, there's about two feet of water.

1244
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,680
Chains.

1245
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,159
Yeah, my feet are chained up. I can feel something.

1246
01:11:15,159 --> 01:11:16,600
Ah.

1247
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:23,520
Bones, Sherlock. There are bones in here.

1248
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,119
What kind of bones?

1249
01:11:26,439 --> 01:11:28,800
Er...I don't know. Small.

1250
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,239
- Redbeard.
- GIRL:
- 'Who's Redbeard?'

1251
01:11:37,239 --> 01:11:40,039
Oh, hello. Are you at the front of the plane now?

1252
01:11:40,039 --> 01:11:42,560
Yeah. I still can't wake the driver up.

1253
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,840
That's all right. What can you see now?

1254
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,479
I can see a river.

1255
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:48,960
- There's...there's...there's a big wheel.
- All right.

1256
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,680
Well, you and I are going to have to drive this plane together.

1257
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,199
Just you and me.

1258
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:55,920
- We are?
- Yeah. There's nothing to it.

1259
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,800
We just need to get in touch with some people on the ground.

1260
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,319
Now, um...can you see anything that looks like a radio?

1261
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:04,079
No.

1262
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:06,920
That's all right, but keep looking, we've got plenty of time.

1263
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,840
BLEEPING

1264
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,399
- Yargh!
- What's wrong?
- The whole plane's shaking.

1265
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:13,960
It's just turbulence, it's nothing to worry about.

1266
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,640
My ears hurt.

1267
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,560
Does the river look like it's getting closer?

1268
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,760
A little bit.

1269
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,359
All right, then, that means you're nearly home.

1270
01:12:22,359 --> 01:12:25,600
Sherlock? I'm in a well.

1271
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,119
That's where I am. I'm in the bottom of a well.

1272
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,079
Why would there be a well in Sherrinford?

1273
01:12:35,079 --> 01:12:36,600
Why is there a draft?

1274
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,119
Walls don't contract after you've painted them.

1275
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:45,600
Not real ones.

1276
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:53,560
I'm home. Musgrave Hall.

1277
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:56,600
- EURUS:
- 'Me and Jim Moriarty, we got on like a house on fire.

1278
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,279
'Which reminded me of home.'

1279
01:12:58,279 --> 01:13:01,520
Yeah, it's just an old building, I don't care. The plane, tell me about the plane NOW!

1280
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,560
'Sweet Jim, he was never very interested in being alive,

1281
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,960
'especially if you could make more trouble being dead.'

1282
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,600
Yeah, still not interested. The plane!

1283
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,079
'You knew he'd take his revenge.

1284
01:13:11,079 --> 01:13:13,800
'His revenge, apparently, is me.'

1285
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,279
Eurus, let me speak to the little girl on the plane and I'll play any game you like.

1286
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:19,960
'First, find Redbeard.'

1287
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,119
I'm letting the water in now.

1288
01:13:22,119 --> 01:13:25,119
You don't want me to drown another one of your pets, do you?

1289
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:30,640
At long last, Sherlock Holmes, it's time to solve the Musgrave ritual.

1290
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,920
Your very first case, and the final problem.

1291
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,439
Oh! Bye-bye.

1292
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:38,760
Sherlock!

1293
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,520
# I that am lost, oh, who will find me deep down below...

1294
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,399
Sherlock!

1295
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:46,960
# ..the old beech tree?

1296
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,720
# Help succour me now the east winds blow...#

1297
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,439
John! John? Can you hear me?!

1298
01:13:52,439 --> 01:13:54,800
# 16 by six, brother and under we go. #

1299
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,840
- John?!
- Argh! Help me! Help me, please!

1300
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,319
- Sherlock!
- # Be not afraid...#

1301
01:13:59,319 --> 01:14:02,199
- John?
- Yeah, it's flooding. The well is flooding!

1302
01:14:02,199 --> 01:14:05,319
- Try as long as possible not to drown.
- What?!

1303
01:14:05,319 --> 01:14:07,600
I'm going to find you! I am finding you!

1304
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,199
Well, hurry up, please, because I don't have long!

1305
01:14:10,199 --> 01:14:13,199
Yargh! It's leaning over! The whole plane!

1306
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:16,079
# Oh, who will find me

1307
01:14:16,079 --> 01:14:20,520
# Deep down below the old beech tree? #

1308
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,359
Argh!

1309
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,199
Eurus, you said the answer's in the song, but I went through the song, line by line

1310
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:31,119
all those years ago and I found nothing. I couldn't find anything!

1311
01:14:31,119 --> 01:14:33,760
There was a beech tree in the grounds and I dug.

1312
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,600
I dug, I dug and dug and dug.

1313
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,159
16 feet by six.

1314
01:14:37,159 --> 01:14:40,640
16 yards, 16 metres, and I found nothing!

1315
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,520
No-one!

1316
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,039
Sherlock?

1317
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:47,800
It was a clever little puzzle, wasn't it?

1318
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,680
So, why couldn't you work it out, Sherlock?

1319
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,640
Sherlock, there's something you need to know.

1320
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,199
Emotional context.

1321
01:14:56,199 --> 01:14:59,399
And here it comes.

1322
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:03,560
Sherlock, the bones I found...

1323
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,439
Yes. They're dogs' bones, that's Redbeard.

1324
01:15:06,439 --> 01:15:09,359
Mycroft's been lying to you, to both of us.

1325
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:11,920
They're not dogs' bones.

1326
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,720
Remember Daddy's allergy? What was he allergic to?

1327
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:19,279
What would he never let you have, all those times you begged?

1328
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:21,920
Well, he'd never let you have a dog.

1329
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,800
FAINT BARKING

1330
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:28,359
Come on, Redbeard.

1331
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:30,760
Your funny little memory, Sherlock.

1332
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:38,960
You were upset, so you told yourself a better story.

1333
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,159
But we never had a dog.

1334
01:16:03,079 --> 01:16:04,560
Victor!

1335
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,000
Now it's coming.

1336
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,279
Victor Trevor.

1337
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,840
We played pirates.

1338
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,800
I was Yellowbeard and he was...

1339
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,279
..he was Redbeard!

1340
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:24,319
You were inseparable, but I wanted to play, too.

1341
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,479
Oh! Oh, God!

1342
01:16:34,119 --> 01:16:38,800
What...what did you do?

1343
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,159
# I that am lost

1344
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:46,159
# Oh, who will find me

1345
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:50,560
# Deep down below the old beech tree...? #

1346
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,399
Please let me out! Please, someone help me! Please!

1347
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,479
'Come on, Redbeard.'

1348
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,159
Victor!

1349
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:21,479
Deep water, Sherlock, all your life, in all your dreams.

1350
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:25,520
Deep waters.

1351
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,079
You killed him!

1352
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,920
You killed my best friend.

1353
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,840
I never had a best friend.

1354
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,079
I had no-one.

1355
01:17:55,399 --> 01:17:58,079
Play with me, Sherlock. Play with me.

1356
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,640
No-one.

1357
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,199
No-one.

1358
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:13,720
OK. OK, let's play.

1359
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:27,399
- GIRL:
- 'Hello? Are you there?'

1360
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:30,119
I need your help. I'm trying to solve a puzzle.

1361
01:18:30,119 --> 01:18:32,920
- 'But what about the plane?!'
- The puzzle will save the plane.

1362
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:36,600
The wrong dates. She used the wrong dates on the gravestones

1363
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,039
as the key to the cipher, and the cipher was the song.

1364
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:41,479
Is this strictly relevant?!

1365
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:43,840
Yes, it is. I'll be with you in a minute.

1366
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,159
The lights are getting closer!

1367
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:55,479
Hush now, working.

1368
01:18:55,479 --> 01:18:57,239
Let's number the words of the song.

1369
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:00,560
Then rearrange the numbered words

1370
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,239
to match the sequence on the gravestones.

1371
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:11,560
I am lost.

1372
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,720
Help me brother.

1373
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,800
Save my life

1374
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,960
before my doom.

1375
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,680
I am lost

1376
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,000
without your love.

1377
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,880
Save my soul, seek my room.

1378
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,479
Oh, God!

1379
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,119
We're going to crash! I'm going to die! Argh!

1380
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:38,720
HE GASPS FOR BREATH

1381
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,760
I think it's time you told me your real name.

1382
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,000
I'm not allowed to tell my name to strangers.

1383
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,479
But I'm not a stranger, am I?

1384
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:54,640
I'm your brother.

1385
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,359
I'm here, Eurus.

1386
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,359
You're playing with me, Sherlock.

1387
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:14,159
We're playing the game.

1388
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,279
The game, yes, I get it now.

1389
01:20:16,279 --> 01:20:18,640
The song was never a set of directions.

1390
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,319
I'm in the plane. I'm going to crash.

1391
01:20:21,319 --> 01:20:23,640
And you're going to save me.

1392
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,079
Look how brilliant you are.

1393
01:20:25,079 --> 01:20:28,399
Your mind has created the perfect metaphor.

1394
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:30,520
You're high above us, all alone in the sky,

1395
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:33,479
and you understand everything except how to land.

1396
01:20:33,479 --> 01:20:36,520
Now, I'm just an idiot, but I'm on the ground.

1397
01:20:38,359 --> 01:20:39,760
I can bring you home.

1398
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:40,840
No.

1399
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,079
No, no. It's too late now.

1400
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:45,479
No, it's not, it's not too late.

1401
01:20:45,479 --> 01:20:50,319
Every time I close my eyes, I'm on the plane.

1402
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:52,960
I'm lost, lost in the sky

1403
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:56,760
and...no-one can hear me.

1404
01:21:00,039 --> 01:21:01,960
Open your eyes.

1405
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,520
I'm here.

1406
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:10,000
You're not lost anymore.

1407
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,640
SHE SOBS

1408
01:21:14,279 --> 01:21:20,439
Now, you...you just, you just went the wrong way last time, that's all.

1409
01:21:20,439 --> 01:21:22,680
This time, get it right.

1410
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,760
Tell me how to save my friend.

1411
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,399
Argh!

1412
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:29,880
Eurus, help me save John Watson.

1413
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,800
HE GASPS

1414
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:46,039
I just spoke to your brother.

1415
01:21:46,039 --> 01:21:48,640
- How is he?
- He's a bit shaken up, that's all.

1416
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,880
She didn't hurt him, she just locked him in her old cell.

1417
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:55,039
- What goes around comes around.
- Give me a moment, boys.

1418
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:58,399
Um...Mycroft, make sure he's looked after.

1419
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:00,640
He's not as strong as he thinks he is.

1420
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:02,960
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.
- Thanks, Greg.

1421
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:08,560
- The helicopter ready?
- Mm-hm.

1422
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,359
Let's move her, then.

1423
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:12,079
Is that him, sir, Sherlock Holmes?

1424
01:22:12,079 --> 01:22:13,319
Fan, are you?

1425
01:22:13,319 --> 01:22:15,640
Well, he's a great man, sir.

1426
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,279
No, he's better than that.

1427
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,520
He's a good one.

1428
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,840
- You OK?
- I said I'd bring her home.

1429
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,800
I can't, can I?

1430
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:33,680
Well, you gave her what she was looking for - context.

1431
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:34,960
Is that good?

1432
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:37,680
It's not good, it's not bad, it's...

1433
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,239
It is what it is.

1434
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:45,239
Alive for all these years?!

1435
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,840
How is that even possible?!

1436
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:53,520
What Uncle Rudi began, I thought it best to continue.

1437
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:58,600
I'm not asking how you did it, idiot boy, I'm asking how could you?!

1438
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:02,279
- I was trying to be kind.
- Kind?!

1439
01:23:02,279 --> 01:23:04,000
Kind?!

1440
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,319
You told us that our daughter was dead!

1441
01:23:07,319 --> 01:23:10,520
Better that than tell you what she had become.

1442
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,560
I'm sorry.

1443
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:17,159
Whatever she became, whatever she is now, Mycroft,

1444
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:19,640
she remains our daughter.

1445
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:21,239
And my sister.

1446
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:22,960
Then you should have done better.

1447
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,960
He did his best.

1448
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,319
Then he's very limited.

1449
01:23:28,319 --> 01:23:30,359
Where is she?

1450
01:23:30,359 --> 01:23:33,920
Back in Sherrinford. Secure this time.

1451
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,680
People have died.

1452
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:39,840
Without doubt, she will kill again if she has the opportunity.

1453
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,960
There's no possibility she'll ever be able to leave.

1454
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,479
When can we see her?

1455
01:23:46,359 --> 01:23:48,000
There's no point.

1456
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,439
How dare you say that?!

1457
01:23:50,439 --> 01:23:52,199
She won't talk.

1458
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:54,640
She won't communicate with anyone in any way.

1459
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:58,159
She has passed beyond our view.

1460
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,920
There are no words that can reach her now.

1461
01:24:02,279 --> 01:24:03,680
Sherlock?

1462
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,760
Well? You were always the grown-up.

1463
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,039
What do we do now?

1464
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,520
HE CHECKS TUNING

1465
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:45,119
HE PLAYS

1466
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:58,199
MUSIC CONTINUES

1467
01:25:15,159 --> 01:25:16,399
SHERLOCK STOPS PLAYING

1468
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:21,119
PLAYING RESUMES

1469
01:25:36,279 --> 01:25:37,600
SHERLOCK STOPS PLAYING

1470
01:25:43,159 --> 01:25:45,560
SHE PLAYS THE SAME MELODY

1471
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:55,560
HE CONTINUES THE MELODY

1472
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:01,520
Er...yeah, I-I think you'd better get round here.

1473
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:07,319
THEY PLAY

1474
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,319
PS, I know you two.

1475
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:31,760
And if I'm gone, I know what you could become.

1476
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,520
Because I know who you really are.

1477
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:37,760
A junky who solves crimes to get high.

1478
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:41,520
And the doctor who never came home from the war.

1479
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:51,479
Will you listen to me? Who you really are, it doesn't matter.

1480
01:26:51,479 --> 01:26:53,880
It's all about the legend.

1481
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:56,800
The stories, the adventures.

1482
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,960
There is a last refuge for the desperate,

1483
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,399
the unloved, the persecuted.

1484
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:16,319
There is a final court of appeal for everyone.

1485
01:27:40,039 --> 01:27:43,359
When life gets too strange,

1486
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:46,319
too impossible, too frightening,

1487
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:49,239
there is always one last hope.

1488
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:53,800
When all else fails, there are two men sitting

1489
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:56,439
arguing in a scruffy flat

1490
01:27:56,439 --> 01:28:00,560
like they've always been there, and they always will.

1491
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:05,159
THE best and wisest men I have ever known.

1492
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:10,520
My Baker Street boys.

1493
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:15,039
Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.
