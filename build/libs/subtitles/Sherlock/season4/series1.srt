No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,160
Oh, do your research.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,560
I'm not a hero - I'm a high-functioning sociopath.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,640

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,120

You know what happened to the other one.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,320
Miss me?

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,720
'Did you miss me? Did you miss me? Did you miss me?'

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,560
I've only been gone four minutes.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,680
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,160
What you're about to see is

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,440
classified beyond top secret.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,040
Is that quite clear? Don't minute any of this.

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,000
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,760
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,800

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,680

Are those ginger nuts?

00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,880
- Oh, God... 
- LOVE ginger nuts.

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,760
Our doctor said you were clean.

00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,480
I am. Utterly.

00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,680
No need for stimulants now, remember? I have work to do.

00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,080
You're high as a kite!

00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,800
Natural high, I assure you. Totally natural.

00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,680
- What would you do, Vivian? 
- Pardon?

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,400
Well, it's a lovely day. Go for a stroll?

48
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,240
Make a paper aeroplane? Have an ice lolly?

49
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,760
Ice lolly, I suppose.

00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,600
Ice lolly it is!

some sort of official pardon.

You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.

You're home and dry.

OK, cheers.

00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,880
I told you - Moriarty's dead.

78
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,880
You say he filmed that video message before he died.

79
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,280
Yes.

80
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,160
You also say you know what he's going to do next.

81
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,200
- What does that mean? 
- Perhaps that's all there is to it.

82
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,040
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.

83
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,520
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.

84
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,800
He's planned something, something long-term.

85
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,920

No, better than that - posthumous game.

- What are you going to do? 
- Wait.

91
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,240
Wait?!

92
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,120
Of course wait. I'm the target - targets wait.

93
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,600
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up,

94
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,920
I'll know when it begins.

95
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,520
I always know when the game is on. Do you know why?

96
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,080
Why?

97
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,400
Because I love it.

98
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,800
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.

99
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,200
WATER SLOSHES One day he saw a stranger

100
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,480
looking at him in surprise,

101
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,760
and he knew that the stranger was Death.

102
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,720
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace

103
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,080
and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.

104
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,240
For there he was sure Death could not find him.

105
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,200
But when, at last, he came to Samarra,

106
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,680
the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.

107
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,000
"Very well," said the merchant. "I give in. I am yours."

108
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,240
"But tell me, why did you look surprised

109
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,480
"when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"

110
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,400
"Because," said Death,

111
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,920
"I had an appointment with you tonight...

112
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,560
"..in Samarra."

113
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,800

- Oh, I have a plan.

I'm going to monitor the underworld,

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,880
every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.

118
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,920
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,160

- Yes? 
- ..sand.

be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.

172
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,760
I'll get back to you.

173
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water

174
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,040
and sanctify it for our use this day.

175
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,880
In Christ's name.

176
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,800
Now, what name have you given your daughter?

177
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,040
Rosamund Mary.

178
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,200
Rosamund?

179
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,840
It means "Rose of the world". Rosie for short.

180
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,240
Didn't you get John's text?

181
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,680
No. I delete his texts. I delete any text that begins "Hi."

182
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,520
No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.

183
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,080
- MRS HUDSON CLEARS THROAT 
- Sorry.

184
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,760
- WHISPERING: 
- Phone!

185
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,800
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child

186
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,240
in their duties as Christian parents?

187
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,880
- BOTH: 
- We are.

188
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,520
- SIRI: 
- 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.

189
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,160
'Please repeat the question.'

190
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,240
As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.

191
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,600
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery,

192
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,960
whereas, to me, it is an open book.

193
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,000
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,920
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.

195
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,120
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle,

196
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,000
do not throw the rattle.

197
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,240
MESSAGE TONE

198
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,680
All right, good girl, good girl. Good girl.

199
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,160
I'd better finish this, hadn't I?

200
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,840
- Hey. 
- Afternoon. He says you've got a good one, Greg?

201
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,240
Oh, yeah.

202
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,080
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.

203
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,920
CHEERS AND APPLAUSE

204
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,840
God, 50!

205
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,960
Where does it go?

206
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,120
I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.

207
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,960
Yeah, well that's impossible. That was before you met me.

208
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,520
- Well, no, no, there never was... 
- "There never was such a time."

209
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,320
She's looking at me disapprovingly again.

210
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,400
No. She's just jealous.

211
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,560
Yeah, well, I think we both are.

212
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,640
- PHONE VIBRATES 
- Oh... 
- No, no, David.

213
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,520
- Come on, you promised. 
- No, it's...

214
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,080
Oh, no... Oh, it's a Skype call.

215
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,080
Oh! Then it must be Charlie. At least he's phoning, I suppose.

216
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,840
Oh, look! Hello!

217
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,520
'Hey, Dad. Happy birthday.

218
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,440
'Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?'

219
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,520
No! Picture's frozen!

220
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,600
'Yeah, signal's rubbish. But I can still hear you.'

221
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,280
Why is it rubbish? Where are you?

222
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,480
- How is he? Is he eating? Ask him if he's eating. 
- No...

223
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,320
- MAN: 
- David? Come on!

224
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,360
OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.

225
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,320
So, Charlie, where are you?

226
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,040
Are you there?

227
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,000
- 'Sorry, I'm here. I'm just a bit...' 
- Are you all right?

228
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,720
- 'It's nothing. Probably just the altitude.' 
- Altitude?

229
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,720
- 'I'm in Tibet. Didn't you see the mountains?' 
- Never mind mountains.

230
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,960
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.

231
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,880
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?' 
- What?

232
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,480
- 'Could you just check something on my car?' 
- Your car?

233
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,640
'To settle a bet. The guys here don't believe

234
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,400
'I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.

235
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,240
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?' 
- Uh, yes, I can do that.

236
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,920
All done. Have you got it?

237
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,080
Charlie?

238
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,200
- LESTRADE: 
- A week later...

239
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,520
Yeah?

240
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,440
..something really weird happens.

241
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,320
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him,

242
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,600
and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house

243
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,120
to try and get away.

244
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,760
Unfortunately...

245
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,440
The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out,

246
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,600
but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car...

247
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,480
Whose body?

248
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,600
Charlie Welsborough, the son.

249
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,720
- What? 
- The son who was in Tibet. DNA all checks out.

250
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,600
Night of the party, the car's empty,

251
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,680
and a week later...

252
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,240
the dead boy's found at the wheel.

253
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,000
SHERLOCK CHUCKLES

254
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,800
- Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you. 
- Have you got a lab report?

255
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,600
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister,

256
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,640
so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.

257
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,000
Who cares about that? Tell me about the seats.

258
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,080
- The seats? 
- Yes, the car seats.

259
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,120
Made of vinyl.

260
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,520
Two different types of vinyl present.

261
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,120
Was it his own car?

262
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,080
Yeah, not flash - he was a student.

263
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,640
- Well, that's suggestive. 
- Why?

264
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,440
- Vinyl's cheaper than leather. 
- Yeah, right?

265
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,920
- There's something else. 
- Yes?

266
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,000
According to this,

267
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,560
Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.

268
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,520
What?

269
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,840
The body in the car, dead for a week.

270
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,120
Oh, this is a good one. Is it my birthday?

271
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,680
You want help?

272
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,880
- Yes, please. 
- One condition. 
- OK.

273
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,880
Take all the credit. It gets boring if I just solve them all.

274
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,040
Yeah, you say that,

275
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,480
but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.

276
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,640
He's got a point.

277
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,840
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna

278
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,120
who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do!

279
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,000
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.

280
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,080
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie. 
- Definitely a sore spot.

281
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,880
- So you take all the glory, thanks... 
- OK! 
- ..thanks all the same.

282
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,600
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you? It's driving me nuts.

283
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,280
Anything you say, Giles.

284
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,960
Just kidding.

285
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,360
HE MOUTHS: What's his name?

286
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,760
- HE MOUTHS: 
- Greg. 
- What?

287
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,000
Greg.

288
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?

289
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,720
John, you amaze me. You know what happened?

290
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,960
Not a clue. It's just you normally say that at this point.

291
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,560
Hmm. Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.

292
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,720
- Hear that? 
- I know.

293
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,560
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood? 
- Oh, good, great. Yeah, amazing.

294
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,280
- Getting any sleep? 
- Christ, no.

295
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,000
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby,

296
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,760
woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.

297
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,360
- Must feel very different... 
- Sorry, what?

298
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,840
Yes, well, you know how it is.

299
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,040
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.

300
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,840
- Are you two having a little joke? 
- Never a word of thanks.

301
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,360
Can't even tell people's faces apart.

302
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,600
This is a joke, isn't it?

303
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,240
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever. You're so, so clever."

304
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,160
- Is it about me? 
- I think he needs winding.

305
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,560
- You know, I think that really might be it. 
- No, don't get it.

306
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,280
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect,

307
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,120
- so go easy on them, yeah? 
- PHONE VIBRATES

308
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,560
- You know me. MARY: 
- 'Hey, hello.' 
- Yeah. 
- Got them, don't worry.

309
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,480
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.

310
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,400
Yeah, never mind about that. Where are you now?

311
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,960
- At the dead boy's house? 
- Yeah.

312
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,200
'And what does he think? Any theories?'

313
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,800
Well, I texted you the details.

314
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,120
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.

315
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,520
- Hey! 
- How do you know about that?

316
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,280
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'

317
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,080
- WHISPERING: 
- They know everything! 
- 'Solved it, then?'

318
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,680
- I'm working on it. 
- 'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'

319
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,560
- Pig! 
- Keep trying.

320
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,200
'So, what about it, then?

321
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,840
'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it?

322
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,720
'And what are you going to call this one?'

323
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,440
Oh, the Ghost Driver.

324
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,360
- Don't give it a title. 
- People like the titles.

325
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,520
- They hate the titles. 
- Give the people what they want.

326
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,200
No, never do that - people are stupid.

327
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,040
Uh, SOME people.

328
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,760
'All people are stupid.

329
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,040
'Most people.'

330
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,840
'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?'

331
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,560
I mean, it's right up your strasse.

332
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,640
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry

333
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
- to hear about your daughter. 
- Son. 
- Son!

334
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,080
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.

335
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,680
Thank you very much for coming. We've heard a great deal about you.

336
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,720
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.

337
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,560
Well, I believe that I...

338
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,240
..can.

339
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,320
- DISTORTED: 
- But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes. I...

340
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,680
Sherlock?

341
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,840
Mr Holmes?

342
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,920
Sorry, you were saying?

343
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,440
Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.

344
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,640
I...I don't think we'll ever get over this.

345
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,040
No. Shouldn't think so.

346
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,360
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment? I just...

347
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,120
I'll...I'll just, um... Ahem.

348
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,120
- Now what's wrong? 
- Not sure, I just...

349
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,720
By the pricking of my thumbs.

350
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,960
Seriously? You?

351
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,560
Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.

352
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,280
They represent data processed too fast

353
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,840
for the conscious mind to comprehend.

354
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,360
What is this?

355
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,080
Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.

356
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,160
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.

357
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,200
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.

358
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,480
Right, yes.

359
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,920
- Who? 
- What?

360
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,640
- Who...? Who was this? 
- Are you serious?

361
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,760
- Sherlock... 
- It's... It's Margaret Thatcher,

362
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,240
the first female Prime Minister of this country.

363
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,360
Right.

364
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,680
- Prime Minister? 
- Hmm. Leader of the Government. 
- Right.

365
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,480
- Female? 
- For God's sake! You know perfectly well who she is.

366
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,000
Why are you playing for time?

367
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,600
It's the gap, look at the gap. It's wrong.

368
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,400
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.

369
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,920
The whole thing's verging on OCD. My respects.

370
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
This figurine is routinely repositioned after

371
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,600
the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day,

372
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,680
yet this ugly gap remains.

373
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,240
- Something's missing from here, but only recently. 
- Yes, a...

374
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,160
- Plaster bust. 
- ..plaster bust. 
- Oh, for God's sake! It got broken.

375
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,280
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie?

376
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,680
- Rug! 
- What? 
- Well, how could it get broken?

377
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,760
The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.

378
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,240
- Does it matter? 
- Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.

379
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,920
- It is worth letting him do this. 
- Is your friend quite mad?

380
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,840
No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.

381
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,120
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.

382
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,960
We found the remains out there in the porch.

383
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,320
- The porch where we came in? 
- How anybody could hate her so much

384
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,680
they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...

385
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,280
I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.

386
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,600
Why didn't he smash all the others? Perfect opportunity,

387
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,200
and look at that one - she's smiling.

388
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,040
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.

389
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,080
- And if there's nothing... 
- I know what happened to your son.

390
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,320
You do?

391
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,440
It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.

392
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,440
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in,

393
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,800
this room was in darkness?

394
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,040
- Well, yes. 
- And the porch where it was smashed,

395
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,840
I noticed the motion sensor was damaged,

396
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,200
- so I assume it's permanently lit. 
- How did you notice that?

397
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,760
I lack the arrogance to ignore details - I'm not the police.

398
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,160
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it. 
- Exactly.

399
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,120
- Why? 
- Don't know. Wouldn't be fun if I knew.

400
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,680
Mr Holmes, please!

401
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,400
It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were

402
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,120
disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.

403
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,840
- After all, he was in Tibet. 
- Yes.

404
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,640
- No. 
- No?

405
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,560
CROWD: # Happy birthday... #

406
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,240
The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.

407
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,520
Easily arranged.

408
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,960
It's a Skype call.

409
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
The trick was meant to be a surprise.

410
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,080
- A trick? 
- Obviously.

411
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,200
Could you take a photo and send it?

412
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,640
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.

413
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,400
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.

414
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,560
Well, good enough.

415
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,840
Effectively a costume.

416
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,880
You're joking?

417
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,120
No, I'm not.

418
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,200
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car

419
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,720
so he could spring the surprise.

420
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,760
- Oh, my God! 
- Surprise!

421
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,040
That's when it happened.

422
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,280
I can't be certain, of course,

423
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,080
but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.

424
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,680
You said he'd felt unwell?

425
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,720
You all right?

426
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,440
'It's nothing. Probably just the altitude.'

427
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,000
He died there and then.

428
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,480
No-one had any cause to go near his car,

429
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,560
so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until...

430
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,480
When the two cars were examined,

431
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,440
the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie,

432
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,680
who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.

433
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,280
Oh, God!

434
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,160
Poor kid.

435
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,080
Really, I'm so sorry. Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.

436
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,280
This is where it was smashed.

437
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,400
- That was amazing. 
- What? 
- The car, the kid.

438
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,480
Ancient history. Why are you still talking about it?

439
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,960
What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?

440
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,560
I can't stand it, never can. There's a loose thread in the world.

441
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,040
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.

442
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,360
What kind of a life would that be?

443
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,920
Besides, I have the strangest feeling...

444
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,080
Miss me?

445
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,280
- That's mine. You two take a...bus. 
- Why?

446
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,960
I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.

447
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,120
The Mall, please.

448
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,520
- I met her once. 
- Thatcher? 
- Rather arrogant, I thought.

449
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,440
- YOU thought that?! 
- Ha, I know.

450
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,680
Why am I looking at this?

451
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,960
That's her, John and Mary's baby.

452
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,120
Oh, I see, yes.

453
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,360
Looks very...fully functioning.

454
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,880
Is that really the best you can do?

455
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,120
Sorry, I've never been very good with them.

456
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,360
- Babies? 
- Humans.

457
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,680
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?

458
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,960
Any interest in her?

459
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,320
Why on earth would he?

460
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,360
I don't know. You tell me.

461
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,240
In the last year of his life,

462
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,920
James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations,

463
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,080
over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks,

464
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,720
including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea,

465
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,760
and had latterly shown some interest

466
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,400
in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias,

467
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,920
which is still missing, by the way,

468
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,760
in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.

469
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,560
It's a pearl - get another one.

470
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,920
There's something important about this.

471
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,520
I'm sure.

472
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,840
Maybe it's Moriarty.

473
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,240
Maybe it's not.

474
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,880
WATER SLOSHES

475
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,480
But something's coming.

476
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,720
Are you having a premonition, brother mine?

477
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,240
The world is woven from billions of lives,

478
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,920
every strand crossing every other.

479
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,360
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.

480
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,760
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data,

481
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,120
the future would be entirely calculable.

482
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,040
As inevitable as mathematics.

483
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,440
- Appointment In Samarra. 
- I'm sorry?

484
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,480
The merchant who can't outrun Death.

485
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,880
You always hated that story as a child.

486
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,000
Less keen on predestination back then.

487
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,600
I'm not sure I like it now.

488
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,760
You wrote your own version, as I remember.

489
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,600
Appointment In Sumatra.

490
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,360
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.

491
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,680
Goodnight, Mycroft.

492
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,760
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.

493
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,920
- Keep me informed. 
- Of what? 
- Absolutely no idea.

494
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,440
'Ammo!'

495
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,680
MAN SHUDDERS

496
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,000
- Oh, hi, Stella. 
- Greg. 
- You, uh...?

497
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,360
- Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so... 
- Right, right, right...

498
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,680
Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?

499
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,280
It's nothing. I mean it's nothing serious.

500
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,480
- No, no. 
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.

501
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,800
Yeah, of course.

502
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,720
I mean he loves a really tricky case.

503
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,920
Yeah, he does!

504
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,680
So what you here for?

505
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,120
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail

506
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,880
leads back to London, so...

507
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,520
The Borgia Pearl? They still after that, are they?

508
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,240
Yeah.

509
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,520
So, how did you two first meet?

510
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,520
Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.

511
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,640
Nobody could figure it out.

512
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,160
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.

513
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,360
- Oh, yeah? How did she die? 
- Hypothermia.

514
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,440
What?

515
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,040
I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...

516
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,440
Will you two please keep it down?!

517
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,600
- Sorry. 
- Sorry.

518
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,880
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?

519
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,640
You started out in manual labour. Don't bother being astonished.

520
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,400
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.

521
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,520
I was a carpenter. Like me dad.

522
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,640
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully -

523
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,160
and you once had a Japanese girlfriend

524
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,560
that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.

525
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,040
How the hell...?

526
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,760
Ah...e-cigarettes.

527
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,760
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.

528
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,120
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested

529
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,240
in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.

530
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,000
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe,

531
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,200
because that means you're not serious about quitting.

532
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,000
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes,

533
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,280
always sure that each will be your last. Anything to add, John?

534
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,720
- John? 
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.

535
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,120
- What is that? 
- That is...me.

536
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,000
Well, it's a me substitute.

537
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,560
Don't be so hard on yourself.

538
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,880
You know I value your little contributions.

539
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,040
Yeah? It's been there since nine this morning.

540
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,480
- Has it? Where were you? 
- Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.

541
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,040
- What about my girlfriend? 
- What? 
- You said I had an ex...

542
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,280
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow

543
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,600
in the name Akako.

544
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,440
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.

545
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,400
But surely that means I want to forget her,

546
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,600
not that I'm indifferent.

547
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,560
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.

548
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,200
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again,

549
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,000
so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.

550
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,040
I... I thought you'd done something clever.

551
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,480
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?

552
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,200
SHERLOCK INHALES DEEPLY

553
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,080
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley,

554
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,480
but I think it's time you knew the truth.

555
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,120
What do you mean?

556
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,840
Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?

557
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,880
- Well... 
- You thought she was having an affair.

558
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,120
I'm afraid it's far worse than that - your wife is a spy.

559
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,240
- What? 
- That's right. Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.

560
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,880
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.

561
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,480
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now

562
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,160
as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy,

563
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,640
across the road from your flat.

564
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,600
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy,

565
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,120
as part of an official state visit.

566
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,640
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter,

567
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,240
disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President

568
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,160
in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug,

569
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,840
hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.

570
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,240
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible

571
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,160
- to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty. 
- What?

572
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,000
Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn

573
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,160
to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly,

574
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,680
which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty,

575
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,520
tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.

576
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,520
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable,

577
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,360
thus precipitating World War III.

578
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,400
- Are you serious? 
- No, of course not.

579
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,160
His wife left him because his breath stinks

580
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,640
and he likes to wear her lingerie.

581
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,440
I don't!

582
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,440
- Just the bras. 
- Get out.

583
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,280
So, what's this all about, then?

584
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,840
- Having fun. 
- Fun? 
- While I can. 
- Mm-hmm.

585
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,680
KNOCK AT DOOR

586
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,400
- Uh, Sherlock... 
- Borgia Pearl. Boring. Go!

587
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,600
- But... 
- Go!

588
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,320
- This had better be good. 
- Oh, I think you'll like it.

589
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,720
That is the bust, isn't it? The one that was broken.

590
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,960
No, it's another one - different owner.

591
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,240
Different part of town.

592
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,800
You were right - this is a thing. Something's going on.

593
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,440
What's wrong? I thought you'd be pleased.

594
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,840
- I am pleased. 
- You don't look pleased.

595
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,280
This is my game face.

596
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,000
And the game is on.

597
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,600
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.

598
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,320
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan. 
- Identical busts?

599
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,840
Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.

600
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,400
Three in total. God knows who'd want to do something like this.

601
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,440
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they? An idee fixe.

602
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,840
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.

603
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,040
No, no good.

604
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,560
There were other images of Margaret... Margaret...?

605
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,920
You know who she is.

606
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,720
..Thatcher, present at the first break-in.

607
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,640
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one? Ooh!

608
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,840
- What? 
- Blood.

609
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,080
Quite a bit of it, too.

610
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,320
Was there any injury at the crime scene?

611
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,720
Nah.

612
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,440
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.

613
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,600
- Come on. 
- Holborn? 
- Lambeth!

614
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,360
- Lambeth? Why? 
- To see Toby.

615
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,080
Ah, right. Who?

616
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,640
- You'll see. 
- Right, are you coming?

617
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,080
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer

618
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,520
that he doesn't want to be late for.

619
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,320
- Who told you? 
- The right sleeve of your jacket,

620
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,200
plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne

621
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,560
and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.

622
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,840
- Have a good time. 
- I will.

623
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,720
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.

624
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,040
- What? 
- She's not the one.

625
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,480
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.

626
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,760
How do you work all that out?

627
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,160
She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.

628
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,680
- Are you just making this up? 
- Possibly. 
- Who's Toby?

629
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,880
There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker,

630
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,080
one of the world's best.

631
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,520
Got himself into serious trouble

632
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,280
with the Americans a couple of years ago.

633
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,120
He hacked into the Pentagon security system,

634
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,560
and I managed to get him off the charge.

635
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,400
Therefore he owes me a favour.

636
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,360
- So, how does that help us? 
- What? 
- Toby the hacker?

637
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,000
- Toby's not the hacker. 
- What?

638
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,360
- All right, Craig? 
- All right, Sherlock?

639
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,680
Craig's got a dog.

640
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,160
So I see.

641
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,520
Good boy!

642
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,400
Hiya!

643
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,320
Mary? What are you...?

644
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,920
No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.

645
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,560
No, exactly. So...don't wait up.

646
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,680
- Hey, Sherlock. 
- Hey. 
- Mary, what are you doing here?

647
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,640
- She's better at this than you. 
- Better? 
- So I texted her.

648
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,360
Hang on, Mary's better than me?

649
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,280
Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.

650
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,160
- Of course she's better. 
- Yeah, OK. 
- Nothing personal.

651
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,080
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I?

652
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,360
What do you think, Sherlock? Shall we take him with us?

653
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,200
- John or the dog? 
- Ha-ha, that's funny! 
- John.

654
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,480
- Well... 
- He's handy and loyal.

655
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,760
- That's hilarious. 
- Hmm. 
- Is it too early for a divorce?

656
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,800
- Oh. 
- Barnicot's house, then. Anyone up for a trudge?

657
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,640
Keep up, he's fast.

658
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,520
- He's not moving. 
- He's thinking.

659
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,120
He's really not moving.

660
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,920
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.

661
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,560
You just like this dog, don't you?

662
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,840
- Well, I like you. 
- He's still not moving.

663
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,000
- Fascinating. 
- Oh!

664
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,520
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

665
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,800
Well, what do you make of it?

666
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,680
- They were looking for something. 
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar,

667
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,520
they came specifically for that Thatcher bust. Why?

668
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,080
DOG SNIFFS

669
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,440
DOG WHINES

670
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,560
Clever.

671
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,120
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail,

672
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,160
- where would you go? 
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.

673
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
Or blood in a butcher's.

674
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,720
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm?

675
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,640
This is it, though. This is the one, I can feel it.

676
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,880
Not Moriarty?

677
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,160
It has to be him. It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.

678
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,120
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.

679
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,560
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.

680
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,520
You should have seen the state of the front room.

681
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,280
- It was like The Exorcist. 
- Huh. Was Rosie's head spinning round?

682
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,520
- No. Just the projectile vomiting. 
- Nice! 
- Hmm.

683
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,360
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.

684
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,080
- Hmm? Noticed what? 
- The little 666 on her forehead.

685
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,920
Hmm, that's The Omen.

686
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,120
- So? 
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.

687
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,360
They're two different things.

688
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,760
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.

689
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,280
BABY CRIES

690
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,440
Yeah, can't she?

691
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,360
I'm coming, darling. Mummy's coming.

692
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,960
- LOVINGLY: 
- Oh, what are you doing?

693
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,560
What are you doing? Come here.

694
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,400
Have you heard of that thing? In Germany?

695
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,560
You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.

696
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,520
Ostalgie. People who missed the old days under the communists.

697
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,840
- People are weird, aren't they? 
- Hmm.

698
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,200
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.

699
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,200
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin. Time's a great leveller, innit?

700
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,960
Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.

701
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,680
Yes, fascinating. Irrelevant. Where exactly did they come from?

702
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,760
I've got into the records of the suppliers - Gelder and Co.

703
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,520
Seems they're from Georgia.

704
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,920
Where exactly?

705
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,040
Tbilisi. Batch of six. One to Welsborough. One to Hassan.

706
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,520
One to Dr Barnicot.

707
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,200
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.

708
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,240
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.

709
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,520
Lestrade? Another one?

710
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,280
- 'Yeah.' 
- Harker or Sandeford?

711
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,400
Harker. And it's murder this time.

712
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,200
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.

713
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,560
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut. Sharp blade.

714
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,600
The same thing inside the house? The bust?

715
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,320
- Two of them this time. 
- Interesting.

716
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,920
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.

717
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,320
- Limited edition of six. 
- And now someone's wandering about

718
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,600
destroying them all. Makes no sense. What's the point?

719
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,200
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.

720
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,120
- Yes, it is. 
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.

721
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,720
I've been slow, far too slow.

722
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,280
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...

723
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,800
Slow but lucky, very lucky.

724
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,080
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.

725
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,720
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.

726
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,520
Congratulations, by the way.

727
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,080
- I'm sorry? 
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.

728
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,240
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog. 
- Yeah, until then, basically.

729
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,560
WATER SPLASHING

730
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,160
That's enough now, love.

731
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,280
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.

732
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,280
And you need to get to bed. Come on.

733
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,680
Wouldn't it be much simpler

734
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,040
to take out your grievances at the polling station?

735
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,080
You were on the run. Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.

736
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,320
You find yourself in a workshop,

737
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,040
plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.

738
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,080
Very clever.

739
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,240
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you?

740
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,280
Who are you?

741
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,880
My name is Sherlock Holmes.

742
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,840
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.

743
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,680
Argh!

744
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,880
You're out of time.

745
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,760
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty. 
- Who?

746
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,480
I know it's him. It must be him.

747
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,720
You think you understand.

748
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,720
You understand nothing.

749
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,080
Well, before the police come in and spoil things,

750
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,760
why don't we just enjoy the moment?

751
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,640
Let me present Interpol's number one case.

752
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,880
Too tough for them, too boring for me.

753
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,840
The Black Pearl of the Borgias!

754
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,080
It's not possible!

755
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,800
How could she...?!

756
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,400
Everything about who I was is on there.

757
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,640
The problems of your past are your business.

758
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,520
The problems of your future...

759
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,240
..are my privilege.

760
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,720
I don't understand.

761
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,080
She... She destroyed it.

762
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,560
She?

763
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,720
You know her! You do, don't you?

764
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,400
You know the bitch?!

765
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,280
She betrayed me.

766
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,120
- Betrayed us all. 
- Mary.

767
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,880
This is about Mary?

768
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,120
Is that what she's calling herself now, eh?

769
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,600
- 'Armed police, you're surrounded!' 
- Give it to me.

770
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,040
- YELLS: 
- Give it to me!

771
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,560
'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.'

772
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,280
Nobody shoots me! Anyone shoots, I kill this man.

773
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,320
'Lay down your weapon. Do it now!'

774
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,240
I'm leaving this place.

775
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,880
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.

776
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,920
'Lay down your weapon.'

777
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,240
You are a policeman, I'm a professional.

778
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,640
Tell her she's a dead woman.

779
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,240
She's a dead woman walking.

780
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,320
She's my friend. And she's under my protection.

781
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,640
Who are you?

782
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,600
I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.

783
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,680
Who's Sherlock Holmes?

784
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,120
Not a policeman.

785
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,840
ALARM BLARES

786
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,680
What do you think? Mate in two?

787
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,640
Don't antagonise them, darling.

788
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,280
Oh, what else is there to do? Chess palls after three months.

789
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,120
Everything palls.

790
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,440
They'll send someone soon.

791
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,000
They? Who are THEY?

792
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in THEY.

793
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Well, I've got something THEY would dearly love,

794
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,800
if only we could get out of here.

795
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,520
I've got Ammo.

796
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,080
Ammo?

797
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,040
- MARY: 
- Madame Ambassador. 
- What took you so long?

798
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,680
- Can't get the staff. 
- Everyone out, now!

799
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,120
Veer left!

800
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,440
SCREAMING

801
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,800
HE LAUGHS

802
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,360
What now? What do we do?

803
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,320
We die.

804
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,800
Well?

805
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,040
He can't have got far. We'll have him in a bit.

806
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,720
- I very much doubt it. 
- Why?

807
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,040
Because I think he used to work with Mary.

808
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,320
GUNFIRE

809
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,080
SHOUTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE

810
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,360
Ammo. Ammo. Ammo.

811
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,440
Ammo. Ammo. Ammo.

812
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,800
Passed out again. It's no fun when they pass out!

813
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,440
We'll come back later.

814
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,560
What would he do if he knew, huh? About the English woman?

815
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,280
What would you do to a traitor?

816
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,720
Maybe we'll tell him one day. If he lives that long.

817
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,840
HE CHUCKLES

818
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,760
I am an idiot, I know nothing.

819
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,920
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.

820
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,960
That was quite a text you sent me.

821
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,000
What's going on, Sherlock?

822
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,880
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,

823
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,280
I couldn't see what was right under my nose.

824
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,560
Expected a pearl.

825
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,000
Oh, my God, that's a...

826
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,120
Yes, it's an AGRA. memory stick, like you gave John,

827
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,840
except this one belongs to someone else. Who?

828
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,840
I don't know. We... We all had one but the others were...

829
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,760
Haven't you even looked at it yet?

830
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,200
- I glanced at it but I prefer to hear it from you. 
- Why?

831
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,240
Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.

832
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,080
There were four of us, agents.

833
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,800
Not just agents.

834
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,240
Polite term.

835
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,080
Alex. Gabriel.

836
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,640
Me. And Ajay.

837
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,560
There was absolute trust between us. The memory sticks guaranteed it.

838
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,680
We all had one.

839
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,920
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.

840
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,520
We could never be betrayed,

841
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,320
because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.

842
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,880
- Who employed you? 
- Anyone who paid well.

843
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,520
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.

844
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,200
And then it all ended.

845
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,600
There was a coup in Georgia.

846
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,320
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.

847
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,720
We got the call to go in, get them out.

848
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,240
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.

849
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,760
- Who from? 
- I don't know, just another voice on the phone.

850
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,200
And a codeword.

851
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,440
- Ammo. 
- Ammo?

852
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,160
Like ammunition.

853
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,560
We went in, but then something went wrong.

854
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,320
Something went really wrong.

855
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,320
GUNFIRE, SCREAMING

856
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,920
That was six years ago.

857
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,840
It feels like forever.

858
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,160
I was the only one that made it out.

859
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,640
No.

860
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,800
What?

861
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,280
I met someone tonight.

862
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,440
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.

863
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,440
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him. What, he's alive?

864
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,840
Yeah, very much so.

865
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,680
I don't believe it, this is amazing! I thought I was the only one,

866
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,320
I thought I was the only one who got out.

867
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,880
Where is he? I need to see him, now!

868
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,280
Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?

869
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,000
Yeah, of course. It was our insurance.

870
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,240
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.

871
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,560
So Ajay survived as well.

872
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,200
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide,

873
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,320
with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why?

874
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,040
I don't know.

875
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,520
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?

876
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,120
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.

877
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,680
SHE LAUGHS

878
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,560
Sorry, no, no, because we...we were family.

879
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,680
Families fall out.

880
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,760
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.

881
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,280
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants,

882
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,000
and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.

883
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,440
Well, he's just trying to find me.

884
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,160
He survived, that's all that matters!

885
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,960
I heard it from his own mouth.

886
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,160
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."

887
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,000
Why would he want to kill me?

888
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,200
- He said you betrayed him. 
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.

889
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,840
Well, it's what he believes.

890
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,440
SHE GASPS

891
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,560
I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.

892
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,520
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.

893
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,000
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.

894
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,200
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.

895
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,240
No, Mary...

896
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,840
You do.

897
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,880
I made a vow, remember?

898
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,120
To look after the three of you.

899
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,040
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.

900
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,800
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.

901
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,640
There's something I think you should read.

902
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,440
What is it?

903
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,360
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.

904
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,720
What are you...?

905
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,080
HE SNIFFS

906
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,960
- Mary... 
- There you go. 
- Oh, no!

907
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,880
It's all right. It's for the best, believe me.

908
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,320
No.

909
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,280
You just look after them till I get back. I'm sorry.

910
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,320
I'm so sorry.

911
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,560
CHILD SINGS

912
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,640
HE GROANS

913
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,800
Agra?

914
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,640
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna

915
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,960
in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.

916
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,000
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.

917
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,880
What are you, Wikipedia?

918
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,800
- Yes. 
- AGRA is an acronym.

919
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,520
Oh, good, I love an acronym.

920
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,960
All the best secret societies have them.

921
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,560
Team of agents, the best. But you know all that.

922
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,080
Of course I do. Go on.

923
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,440
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.

924
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,720
Indeed? Well, that's news to me.

925
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,040
Is it? He's already killed looking for that memory stick.

926
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,000
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder,

927
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,360
I thought that might include you?

928
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,080
- Me? 
- Well, I mean the British government,

929
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,480
or whatever government you're currently propping up.

930
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:23,680
AGRA were very reliable. Then came the Tbilisi incident.

931
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,960
They were sent in to free the hostages

932
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,040
but it all went horribly wrong.

933
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,440
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.

934
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,760
- Your initiative? 
- My initiative.

935
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,400
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.

936
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,320
I don't like loose ends. Not on my watch.

937
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,240
There was something else. A detail.

938
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,440
A codeword.

939
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,000
Ammo?

940
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,320
It's all I've got.

941
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,800
Little enough.

942
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,920
Could you do some digging as a favour?

943
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,160
You don't have many favours left.

944
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,120
Then I'm calling them all in.

945
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,520
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then?

946
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,480
You think you can go on saving her forever?

947
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,680
Of course.

948
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,280
Is that sentiment talking?

949
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,000
No, it's me.

950
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,280
Difficult to tell the difference these days.

951
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,960
Told you, I made a promise. A vow.

952
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,920
All right. I'll see what I can do.

953
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,400
But remember this, brother mine,

954
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,960
agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.

955
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:30,720
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.

956
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,320
Not on my watch.

957
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,680
- MARY: 
- 'My darling, I need to tell you this

958
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,080
'because you mustn't hate me for going away.'

959
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,320
- NEW YORK ACCENT: 
- Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.

960
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,560
- Can you hear a squeaking? 
- No.

961
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,680
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel -

962
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,280
Why Planes Fail.

963
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,480
- Did you see it? 
- Can't say I did. 
- Oh, truly terrifying.

964
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,000
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am! Ha.

965
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,240
Everything OK, madam?

966
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,400
No. No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining?

967
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:05,320
I hear a squeaking. Probably the wing will come off is all.

968
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,120
Everything's fine, I promise you. Just relax.

969
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,280
Oh, OK. Relax.

970
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,160
- She said relax. 
- SHE CHUCKLES

971
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,520
Did you have a nice time in London?

972
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,040
It was OK, I guess. But did somebody hide the sun?

973
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,800
- Did you lose it in the war? 
- SHE LAUGHS

974
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,560
'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.

975
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,160
'I'm not running, I promise you that,

976
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,040
'I just need to do this in my own way.'

977
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,680
Oh, God! I'm... I-I don't feel so good.

978
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,800
Oh, my God!

979
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,000
FLIGHT ATTENDANT BUTTON BEEPS

980
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,880
- Everything OK, madam? 
- I think I'm dying.

981
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,000
I don't feel so good.

982
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,040
You're all right.

983
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,680
Oh, you're sweet. You have a very kind face.

984
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,040
God will smile on you.

985
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,720
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,

986
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,280
'I'm sorry, my love.'

987
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,200
'I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.

988
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,320
'Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate

989
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,520
'the roll of a dice.

990
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,760
'I need to move the target far, far away from you

991
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,520
'and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.

992
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,240
'I swear I will.'

993
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,520
LAUGHTER

994
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,600
Not like this one.

995
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,000
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.

996
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,440
I've got you where I want you. Give in, give in!

997
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:32,280
I will destroy you. You're completely at my mercy.

998
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,480
Mr Baker. Well, that completes the set.

999
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,880
- No, it does not. 
- Well, who else am I missing?

1000
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,960
Master Bun, it's not a set without him.

1001
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,880
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?

1002
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,280
Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.

1003
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,760
Oh, hi, Mary.

1004
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,920
What concept?

1005
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,560
Happy families. Nice trip?

1006
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:52,080
- How the f...? 
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.

1007
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,720
- How did you get in here? 
- Karim let me in.

1008
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,560
Hello.

1009
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,720
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?

1010
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,880
- Sure. 
- Thank you.

1011
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,320
Nice to meet you, missus.

1012
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,520
No, I mean how did you find me?

1013
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,040
I'm Sherlock Holmes.

1014
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,480
No, really, though, how?

1015
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,720
Every movement I made was entirely random,

1016
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,200
every new personality just on the roll of a dice!

1017
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,920
Mary, no human action is ever truly random.

1018
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,080
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability,

1019
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,880
mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the

1020
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,720
known dispositions of any given individual,

1021
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,720
can reduce the number of variables considerably.

1022
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,640
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine

1023
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,640
a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities

1024
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,040
down to the smallest number of feasible variables.

1025
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,720
But they're really difficult,

1026
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,360
so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.

1027
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,200
HE CHUCKLES

1028
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,280
- JOKINGLY: 
- Oh, you bastard!

1029
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,040
- ANGRILY: 
- You bastard! 
- I know, but your face!

1030
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,040
"The mathematics of probability"?

1031
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,280
- You believed that. 
- "Feasible variables"?

1032
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,600
Yes, I started to run out about then.

1033
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,040
In the memory stick!

1034
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,600
Yeah, that was my idea.

1035
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,680
- AGRA? 
- Yes.

1036
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,880
Uh-huh. You said it was your initials.

1037
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,920
In a way that was true.

1038
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,360
In a way? So many lies.

1039
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,960
I'm so sorry.

1040
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,800
And I don't just mean you.

1041
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,640
What?

1042
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,520
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...

1043
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,120
You're R?

1044
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,120
Rosamund?

1045
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,160
Rosamund Mary.

1046
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,760
I always liked Mary.

1047
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,000
Yeah, me too.

1048
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,920
I used to.

1049
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,200
I just... I didn't know what else to do.

1050
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,760
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.

1051
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,880
That's what couples are supposed to do. Work things through.

1052
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,000
Yes.

1053
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,160
Yes, of course.

1054
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,040
Mary, I may not be a very good man...

1055
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,000
..but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for,

1056
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,720
- most of the time. 
- All the time.

1057
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,680
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.

1058
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,840
You never judge, you never complain.

1059
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,720
I don't deserve you, I...

1060
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,280
All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.

1061
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,960
I will keep you safe.

1062
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,000
But it has to be in London.

1063
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,640
It's my city, I know the turf.

1064
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,280
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.

1065
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,600
Get down!

1066
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,480
RAPID GUNFIRE

1067
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,120
Hello again.

1068
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,480
- Ajay? 
- Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.

1069
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,400
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.

1070
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,480
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.

1071
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,080
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.

1072
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,240
I thought I was the only one who got out.

1073
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,040
How did you find us?

1074
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,520
By following you, Sherlock Holmes. I mean, you're clever.

1075
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:18,120
You found her but I found you. So perhaps not so clever.

1076
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:21,480
And now here we are. At last.

1077
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,760
- HE CHUCKLES 
- Touche!

1078
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,000
Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this,

1079
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,160
we can work it out.

1080
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,440
She thought I was dead.

1081
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,440
I might as well have been.

1082
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,400
It was always just the four of us, always, remember?

1083
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,440
Oh, yeah.

1084
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,040
So why do you want to kill me?

1085
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,200
Do you know how long they kept me prisoner? What they did to me?

1086
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,040
They tortured Alex to death.

1087
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,400
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking. But you?

1088
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,560
You, where were you?

1089
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,760
That day at the embassy, I escaped.

1090
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:55,800
Ha!

1091
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,080
But I lost sight of you too, so you explain. Where were you?

1092
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:02,400
Oh, I got out. For a while.

1093
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,560
Long enough to hide my memory stick.

1094
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,360
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.

1095
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,120
- I 
- was loyal, you see.

1096
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,880
Loyal to my friends.

1097
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:15,400
But they took me, tortured me. Not for information.

1098
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,680
Not for anything except fun.

1099
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,520
They thought I'd give in, die,

1100
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,960
but I didn't, I lived.

1101
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,480
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.

1102
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,440
Six years they kept me there.

1103
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,200
Until one day I saw my chance.

1104
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,400
Oh, and I made them pay.

1105
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,320
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.

1106
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:46,000
Little whispers. Laughter. Gossip.

1107
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,280
How the clever agents had been betrayed.

1108
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,960
Brought down by you!

1109
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,240
- Me? 
- TRAIN WHISTLES

1110
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,000
You know I'll kill you too. You know I will, Ajay.

1111
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,240
What, you think I care if I die?

1112
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,040
I've dreamed of killing you...

1113
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,280
..every night for six years.

1114
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,560
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.

1115
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,880
I swear to you, Ajay.

1116
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,840
What did you hear, Ajay?

1117
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,800
When you were a prisoner, what EXACTLY did you hear?

1118
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,240
What did I hear?

1119
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,600
Ammo.

1120
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,680
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.

1121
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,000
"Ammo.

1122
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,360
"Ammo. Ammo."

1123
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,800
We were betrayed!

1124
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,000
- And they said it was her? 
- That you betrayed us!

1125
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,120
They said her name?

1126
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,240
Yeah, they said it was the English woman.

1127
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,080
No! No!

1128
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,720
'The English woman, that's all he heard.

1129
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,600
'Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.'

1130
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,480
Couldn't this wait until you're back?

1131
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,560
No, it's not over.

1132
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,360
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed,

1133
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,680
the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.

1134
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,520
There was only a voice on the phone.

1135
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,240
'Remember? And a codeword.'

1136
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,360
"Ammo," yes, you said.

1137
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,760
How's your Latin, brother dear?

1138
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,000
My Latin?

1139
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,240
Amo, amas, amat.

1140
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,160
I love, you love, he loves. What...?

1141
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:30,480
Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning?

1142
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,000
You'd better be right, Sherlock.

1143
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,240
Bloody thing!

1144
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,200
What's going on?

1145
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,080
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood,

1146
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:03,040
your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.

1147
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,080
What?

1148
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,560
'So many lies. And I don't just mean you.'

1149
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,320
- Hello. 
- Ah, hello.

1150
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,280
- I like your daisy. 
- Thank you, yeah.

1151
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,880
- It's not really me, though, I think. 
- No? 
- No, no, it's too floral for me.

1152
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,880
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.

1153
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,480
Well, I think they're nice.

1154
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,080
Nice eyes.

1155
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,600
- HE LAUGHS 
- Thank you. 
- Look... Look...

1156
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,080
I don't normally do this,

1157
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,880
- but, um... 
- But you're going to.

1158
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,000
Yeah.

1159
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,720
- What's this? 
- This is me.

1160
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:17,640
- Thank you. Cheers. 
- Yeah. Great.

1161
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:18,880
- Bye! 
- Bye.

1162
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,840

PHONE BEEPS

1164
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,120
Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.

1165
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,240
Hmm? Noticed what?

1166
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,800
The little 666 on her forehead.

1167
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,080
Hmm, that's The Omen.

1168
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,360
- So? 
- Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.

1169
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,880
They're two different things.

1170
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,680
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.

1171

BABY CRIES

1172
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,080
- Yeah, can't she? 
- Hmm.

1173
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,720
I'm coming darling. I'm coming.

1175
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:56,360
Oh, what are you doing?

01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,480
What are you doing?

1177
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,400
Come here...

1178
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,080
It's OK.

1179
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,000
Do you want a cuddle?

I know.

Oh, sweetheart.

1183
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:30,000
Ssh. Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you?

1184
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,160
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?

1185
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,960
Oh, let's go and see Daddy!

1186
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,880
Daddy's here. It's OK, Rosie.

1187
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,240
I'll take her.

1188
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,240
- Yeah? 
- Yeah, I may as well get up now.

1189
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:46,600
Hey, baby, it's Daddy. Your daddy.

1190
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,480
Come here, Rose. Come here, darling, it's all right.

1191
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,600
Thank you.

1192
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:45,280
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.

1193
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,960
How many more times?

1194
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:51,560
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.

1195
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,440
And you're basing all this on a code name?

1196
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:58,680
On a whispered voice on the telephone? Come on, Mycroft.

1197
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,760
You were the conduit for AGRA.

1198
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,760
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.

1199
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,560
It was my job.

1200
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,120
Then there was the Tbilisi incident. AGRA went in.

1201
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,480
- Yes. 
- And they were betrayed.

1202
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:10,880
Not by me.

1203
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,880
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.

1204
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:19,920
I promise you,

1205
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,320
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.

1206
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:27,240
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.

1207
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:31,760
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.

1208
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,920
Not one.

1209
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,520
Not. One.

1210
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,680
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories? I'd like to do those.

1211
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:57,720
Yeah?

1212
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,240
Yeah. I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.

1213
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,720
Although she does seem to enjoy them.

1214
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,520
Well, I'll have to give that a go.

1215
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,120
Got a lot to catch up on.

1216
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,480
- AJAY: 
- 'You think you understand. You understand nothing.'

1217
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,720
- MYCROFT: 
- 'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.'

1218
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,960
- MARY: 
- 'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.

1219
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,120
'They know everything.'

1220
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,200
'They said it was the English woman.'

1221
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,160
'Don't minute any of this.'

1222
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,440
'They know everything.'

1223
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,600
- You don't make it easy, do you? 
- What do you mean?

1224
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,680
Well, being...being so perfect.

1225
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,800
Mary, I... I need to tell you...

1226
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,680
- PHONE BEEPS 
- Hang on.

1227
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:13,920
Can you tell me later?

1228
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,240
- Yeah. 
- Great. 
- Yeah.

1229
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,960
Well, no, we can't just go.

1230
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,000
- Rosie. 
- Yeah. 
- Er, you go. 
- No!

1231
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,120
I'll come as soon as I've found someone - Mrs Hudson.

1232
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,040
- Corfu till Saturday. Molly? 
- Er, yeah, I'll try.

1233
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,760
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.

1234
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,200
You know that's not going to happen.

1235
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,040
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.

1236
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,200
Yeah, OK, you win.

1237
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:51,520
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.

1238
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,600
'Please make your way to the exit. Thank you.'

1239
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,640
Your office said I'd find you here.

1240
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,680
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.

1241
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,520
We're like them.

1242
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,040
Ghostly, living in the shadows.

1243
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,680
Predatory?

1244
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,600
Well, it depends which side you're on.

1245
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,280
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.

1246
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,840
Nice location for the final act,

1247
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,800
couldn't have chosen it better myself.

1248
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,880
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.

1249
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,640
I just come here to look at the fish.

1250
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,160
I knew this would happen one day.

1251
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,640
- It's like that old story. 
- I really am a very busy man.

1252
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,280
Would you mind cutting to the chase?

1253
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,000
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?

1254
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,480
With good reason.

1255
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:50,640
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad."

1256
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,280
I really have never liked this story.

1257
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:56,560
I'm just like the merchant in the story,

1258
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,280
I thought I could out-run the inevitable.

1259
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,560
I've always been looking over my shoulder,

1260
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:05,080
- always expecting to see the grim figure of... 
- Death.

1261
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,200
- Hello, Mary. 
- Hey. 
- John? 
- On his way.

1262
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,760
Let me introduce Ammo.

1263
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,080
You were Ammo?

1264
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,240
You were the person on the phone that time?

1265
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,720
Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.

1266
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,560
Why did you betray us?

1267
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,080
Why does anyone do anything?

1268
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,200
Hmm. Let me guess, selling secrets?

1269
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,520
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.

1270
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,160
Worked very well for a few years.

1271
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,480
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.

1272
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,760
But...

1273
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:36,840
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out. I thought I'd had it.

1274
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:40,120
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.

1275
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,600
- SHE CHUCKLES 
- I couldn't believe my luck!

1276
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,160
That bought me a little time.

1277
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,400
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.

1278
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,400
Very handy. They were always such reliable killers.

1279
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,080
What you didn't know, Mary,

1280
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:54,400
was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.

1281
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,800
Lady Smallwood gave the order.

1282
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,680
But I sent another one to the terrorists,

1283
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,360
with a nice little clue about her code name,

1284
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:05,280
should anyone have an enquiring mind.

1285
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,080
Seemed to do the trick.

1286
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,200
And you thought your troubles were over.

1287
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,640
I was tired.

1288
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,760
Tired of the mess of it all.

1289
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,960
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.

1290
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,320
The hostages were killed.

1291
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,720
AGRA too.

1292
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,920
Or so I thought.

1293
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,360
My secret was safe.

1294
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,600
But...apparently not.

1295
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,360
Just a little peace.

1296
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,920
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?

1297
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:42,160
A family? Home?

1298
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,480
Really, I understand.

1299
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:50,000
So, just let me get out of here, right?

1300
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,800
Let me just walk away.

1301
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,360
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.

1302
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:57,840
What do you say?

1303
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,560
After what you did?!

1304
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,600
Mary, no!

1305
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,040
OK.

1306
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,560
London Aquarium. Yes, now.

1307
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,120
I was never a field agent.

1308
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,520
I always thought I'd be rather good.

1309
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,000
MARY SCOFFS

1310
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,760
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.

1311
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,040
Thanks.

1312
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,720
- For a secretary. 
- What?

1313
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,120
It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back,

1314
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,560
keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than

1315
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,760
most of the people in the room.

1316
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:31,800
- I didn't do this out of jealousy. 
- No?

1317
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,120
Same old drudge, day in, day out.

1318
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:39,240
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.

1319
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:42,440
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.

1320
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:45,720
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.

1321
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,880
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.

1322
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,360
- Yes, your little flat. 
- How do you know? 
- Well, on your salary,

1323
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,480
it would have to be modest,

1324
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,800
and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?

1325
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,680
And what are you, widowed or divorced?

1326
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,040
Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it

1327
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:01,000
to another finger. That means you're sentimentally attached to it,

1328
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,240
but you're not still married.

1329
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,960
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.

1330
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,920
- Sherlock... 
- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell,

1331
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,720
judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.

1332
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,880
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner,

1333
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,320
a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.

1334
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,680
- Sherlock, don't. 
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.

1335
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,320
There's clearly no-one new in your life,

1336
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,920
or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.

1337
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,560
That accounts for the drink problem too,

1338
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,880
the slight tremor in your hand,

1339
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,520
the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.

1340
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:28,320
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.

1341
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,400
To prove how good you are.

1342
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:35,800
To make up for the inadequacies of your...little life.

1343
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,240
Well, Mrs Norbury,

1344
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,120
I must admit this is unexpected.

1345
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,280
Vivian Norbury,

1346
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,160
who out-smarted them all.

1347
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,160
All except Sherlock Holmes.

1348
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:52,760
There's no way out.

1349
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,880
So it would seem.

1350
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,720
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.

1351
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:00,760
It's what I do.

1352
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,560
Maybe I can still surprise you.

1353
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,720
Now, come on, be sensible.

1354
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,040
Hmm, no, I don't think so.

1355
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,080
- Ah! 
- Surprise!

1356
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,840
MARY GASPS FOR AIR

1357
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,520
MARY GROANS

1358
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:32,360
Everything's fine. It's going to be OK.

1359
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,520
Get an ambulance!

1360
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:37,320
- It's all right, it's all right. 
- Mary! 
- John.

1361
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:41,480
All right, Mary? Mary? Stay with me, stay with me.

1362
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,320
- Oh, come on... 
- No, don't worry.

1363
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,680
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.

1364
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,840
Come on, Mary. Mary?

1365
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,760
Oh, God. John, I think this is it.

1366
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,200
No, no, no, no. It's not.

1367
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,920
- That's... 
- You made me so happy.

1368
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:57,040
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted...

1369
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,680
Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.

1370
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,560
- Look after Rosie. 
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.

1371
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,120
- Promise me. 
- I promise. 
- No... 
- Yes, I promise.

1372
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:08,040
- Promise me! 
- I promise, I promise. Ssh, ssh.

1373
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,560
Hey, Sherlock.

1374
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,600
Yes.

1375
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,000
I...

1376
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,600
so like you.

1377
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,000
Did I ever say?

1378
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,560
Yes, yes, you did.

1379
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:25,000
I'm sorry for...for shooting you that time. I'm really sorry.

1380
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,080
- It's all right. 
- I think we're even now, OK?

1381
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,600
OK.

1382
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,640
- Oh, I think we're... 
- Mary, Mary...

1383
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,680
- ..even, definitely even. 
- Ssh, ssh. 
- Ooh.

1384
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,760
You were my whole world.

1385
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,280
Being Mary Watson...

1386
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:53,720
..was the only life worth living.

1387
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,240
- Mary... 
- Thank you.

1388
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,040
Mary...

1389
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,760
HE BEWAILS

1390
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,560
Don't you dare!

1391
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,080
You made a vow.

1392
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:48,280
You swore it.

1393
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:07,760
PHONE BEEPS REPEATEDLY

1394
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:19,160
'You've been having dreams. A recurring dream?'

1395
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,800
CLOCK TICKS RHYTHMICALLY

1396
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,720
Do you want to talk about it?

1397
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,160
This is a two-way relationship, you know.

1398
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,160
SHE SIGHS

1399
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:55,040
The whole world has come crashing down around you.

1400
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,000
Everything's hopeless.

1401
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,040
Irretrievable.

1402
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,000
I know that's what you must feel...

1403
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:06,920
..but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.

1404
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,920
That's not really my style.

1405
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,280
I need to know what to do.

1406
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,160
Do?

1407
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,520
About John.

1408
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,120
BACK CRACKS, HE GROANS

1409
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:14,080
Put me through to Sherrinford, please. Yes, I'll wait.

1410
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,400
- SOBS: 
- But nothing will ever be the same again, will it?

1411
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,280
I'm afraid it won't.

1412
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:29,600
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.

1413
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,440
Look after little Rosie.

1414
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,640
I'm just going to, um...

1415
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:38,120
..look through these things. There might be a case.

1416
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:42,040
A case? Oh, you're not up to it, are you?

1417
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:46,440
Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.

1418
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:49,680
Yes. Yes, I expect you're right.

1419
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,720
I'll make some tea, shall I?

1420
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,400
- Mrs Hudson? 
- Yes, Sherlock?

1421
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:59,960
If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself,

1422
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:02,840
cocky or over-confident...

1423
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:06,200
- Yes? 
- ..would you just say the word Norbury to me? Would you?

1424
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,120
Norbury?

1425
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,160
Just that.

1426
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:12,400
I'd be very grateful.

1427
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:18,520
What's this?

1428
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,480
Oh, I brought that up. It was mixed up with my things.

1429
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,280
Oh, God! Is that...?

1430
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,040
- Must be. 
- Oh.

1431
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,160
I knew it wouldn't end like this.

1432
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:35,680
I knew Moriarty made plans.

1433
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,600
'I thought that would get your attention.

1434
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,600
'So, this is in case...

1435
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,520
'In case the day comes.

1436
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:52,800
'If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.

1437
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,880
'I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows?

1438
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:59,000
'Nothing's certain, nothing's written.

1439
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
'My old life...

1440
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,200
'..it was full of consequences.

1441
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:11,160
'The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.

1442
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,880
'You need to remember that. So...

1443
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:20,600
'..I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.

1444
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:25,120
'Might be the hardest case of your career.

1445
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:30,160
'When I'm...gone, if I'm gone...

1446
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:35,040
'..I need you to do something for me.'

1447
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,320
- BABY GURGLES 
- Hi.

1448
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,040
I just wondered how things were going and...

1449
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,400
..if there was anything I could do.

1450
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,800
It's, er, it's from John.

1451
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,440
- Right. 
- You don't need to read it now.

1452
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,240
I'm sorry, Sherlock.

1453
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:12,880
He says... John said if you were to come round asking after him,

1454
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,040
offering to help...

1455
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:17,760
Yes?

1456
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,920
He said he'd...

1457
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,520
..that he'd rather have anyone but you.

1458
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,480
Anyone.

1459
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,960
DOOR CLOSES

1460
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:45,160
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.

1461
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,480
'When I'm gone, if I'm...gone...

1462
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,800
'..I need you to do something for me.

1463
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,240
'Save John Watson.

1464
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:07,440
'Save him, Sherlock.

1465
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,160
'Save him.'

1466
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,760
'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet?

1467
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:28,920
'When does the road become a river with only one destination?'

1468
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:36,040
'Death waits for us all in Samarra.

1469
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,240
'But can Samarra be avoided?'

1470
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,720
'Go to hell, Sherlock.'
