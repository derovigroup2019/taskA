1
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,679
Hello.

2
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,199
Are you all right?

3
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,279
What is it, dear? Are you lost?

4
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:06,754
Sync and corrected by <font color="#ffff00">APOLLO</font>
<font color="#00ff00"> www.addic7ed.com</font>

5
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,159
Well, that was tedious.
You went on the tube like that?

6
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,200
None of the cabs would take me.

7
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,279
Nothing?

8
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,599
Military coup in Uganda.

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,199
Another photo of you
with the...

10
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,159
Well, um, Cabinet reshuffle?

11
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,719
Nothing of importance?

12
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,319
God!

13
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,199
John, I need some. Get me some.

14
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,999
No. Get me some.

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,519
No. Cold turkey we agreed,
no matter what.

16
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,999
Anyway, you've paid
everyone off, remember?

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,599
No-one within a two-mile radius
will sell you any.

18
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,279
Stupid idea. Whose idea was that?

19
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:40,240
Mrs Hudson!

20
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,399
Look, Sherlock, you're doing
really well, don't give up now!

21
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,600
Tell me where they are!

22
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:54,000
Please, tell me.

23
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,039
Please.

24
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,519
Can't help, sorry. I'll let you know
next week's lottery numbers.

25
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,760
It was worth a try.

26
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,439
My secret supply, what have you done
with my secret supply?

27
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,639
Cigarettes, what have you done
with them?

28
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,599
You never let me touch your things!
Chance would be a fine thing.

29
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,559
I thought you weren't
my housekeeper. I'm not.

30
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,999
How about a nice cuppa and perhaps
you could put away your harpoon?

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,400
I need something stronger than tea.
Seven percent stronger.

32
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,119
You've been to see Mr Chatterjee
again. Pardon?

33
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,540
Sandwich shop. That's a new dress,
but there's flour on the sleeve.

34
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,959
You wouldn't dress
like that for baking.

35
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,679
Sherlock...
Thumbnail. Tiny traces of foil.

36
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,839
Been at the scratch cards again.
We all know where that leads.

37
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,799
Kasbah Nights. Racy for a
Monday morning, wouldn't you agree?

38
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,159
I wrote a blog on the identification
of perfumes. You should look it up!

39
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,820
Please! Don't pin your hopes
on that cruise with Mr

40
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:58,479
Chatterjee, he's got a wife
nobody knows about. Sherlock!

41
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,660
Well, nobody except me.
I don't know what

42
00:04:00,661 --> 00:04:02,839
you're talking about,
I really don't!

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,599
What the bloody hell was all
that about? You don't understand.

44
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,920
Go after her and apologise.

45
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,759
Apologise?

46
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,320
John, I envy you so much.

47
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,159
You envy me?

48
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,239
Your mind, it's so placid,
straight-forward, barely used.

49
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,799
Mine's like an engine,
racing out of control.

50
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,560
A rocket, tearing
itself to pieces,

51
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:28,319
trapped on the launch pad.
I need a case!

52
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,879
You've just solved one, by harpooning
a dead pig, apparently!

53
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,519
That was this morning.

54
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,080
When's the next one?
Nothing on the website?

55
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,119
"Dear Mr Sherlock Holmes.
I can't find Bluebell anywhere.

56
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,359
"Please, please,
please can you help?"

57
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,359
Bluebell? A rabbit, John!
But there's more.

58
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,879
Before Bluebell disappeared,
it turned luminous.

59
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,000
"Like a fairy," according
to little Kirsty.

60
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,119
Then the next morning,
Bluebell was gone.

61
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,279
Hutch still locked,
no sign of a forced entry.

62
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,279
What am I saying, this is brilliant!
Phone Lestrade.

63
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,239
Tell him there's an escaped rabbit.
Are you serious? It's this or Cluedo.

64
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,599
No.
We are never playing that again.

65
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,359
Why not? It's not possible
for the victim to have done it.

66
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,119
It was the only possible solution.
It's not in the rules.

67
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,959
Well, then, the rules are wrong!

68
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,799
A single ring.

69
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,559
Maximum pressure,
just under the half second.

70
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,040
Client!

71
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,319
Dartmoor, it's always been
a place of myth and legend,

72
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,679
but is there something else
lurking out here?

73
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,879
Something very real.

74
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,759
Dartmoor is also home to one the
government's most secret of operations,

75
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,799
the chemical and biological weapons
research centre,

76
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,359
which is said to be even more
sensitive than Porton Down.

77
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,919
Since the end of
the Second World War,

78
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,559
there have been persistent stories
about the Baskerville experiments.

79
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,119
Genetic mutations,
animals grown for the battlefield.

80
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,840
There are many who
believe that within this

81
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:01,559
compound, in the heart of
this ancient wildness,

82
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,879
there are horrors beyond imagining.

83
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,039
But the real question is,
are all of them still inside?'

84
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,680
I was just a kid.

85
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,359
It was on the moor.

86
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,479
It was dark, but I know what I saw.

87
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,840
I know what killed my father.

88
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,720
What did you see?

89
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:27,279
I was just about to say.

90
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,079
Yes, in a TV interview.
I prefer to do my own editing.

91
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,880
Yes. Sorry, yes, of course.

92
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,199
Excuse me.

93
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,320
In your own time.

94
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:41,560
But quite quickly.

95
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,119
Do you know Dartmoor, Mr Holmes? No.

96
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,719
It's an amazing place,
it's like nowhere else,

97
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,279
it's sort of bleak, but beautiful.

98
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,440
Not interested. Moving on.

99
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,719
We used to go for walks,
after my mum died, my dad and me.

100
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,239
Every evening,
we'd go out onto the moor.

101
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,320
Good. Skipping to the
night that your dad was

102
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:08,400
violently killed, where
did that happen?

103
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,839
There's a place,

104
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,520
it's a sort of local landmark,
called Dewer's Hollow.

105
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,360
That's an ancient name
for the devil.

106
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,960
So?

107
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,200
Did you see the devil that night?

108
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,119
Yes.

109
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,679
It was huge.

110
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,160
Coal-black fur with red eyes.

111
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,039
It got him.

112
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,800
Tore at him, tore him apart.

113
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,999
I can't remember anything else.

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,919
They found me the next morning,
just wandering on the moor.

115
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,959
My dad's body was never found.

116
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,159
Red eyes, coal-black fur,
enormous...

117
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,599
A dog? Wolf?

118
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,160
Or a genetic experiment.

119
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,959
Are you laughing at me, Mr Holmes?

120
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,160
Why, are you joking?

121
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,239
My dad was always going on about the
things they were doing at Baskerville.

122
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,199
About the type of monsters
they were breeding there.

123
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,479
People used to laugh at him.

124
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,999
At least the TV people
took me seriously.

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,079
And I assume did wonders
for Devon tourism. Yeah...

126
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,439
Henry, whatever did happen
to your father, it was 20 years ago.

127
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,319
Why come to us now?

128
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,359
Not sure you can help me, Mr Holmes,
since you find it all so funny!

129
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,960
Because of what happened last night.
Why, what happened last night?

130
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,599
How... How do you know?

131
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,119
I didn't know, I noticed.

132
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,839
You came up from Devon
on the first train this morning.

133
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,240
You had a disappointing
breakfast and a black coffee.

134
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,639
The girl across the
aisle fancied you.

135
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,079
Though initially keen,
you've changed your mind.

136
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,879
You are anxious to have
your first cigarette of the day.

137
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,960
Sit down, Mr Knight, and do
please smoke. I'd be delighted.

138
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,519
How on Earth did you notice
all that? It's not important...

139
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,839
Punched out holes where your
ticket's been checked. Not now.

140
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,760
I've been cooped-up for ages!
You're showing off.

141
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:35,679
I am a show-off,
that's what we do.

142
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,160
Train napkin you used to mop up
the spilled coffee.

143
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,799
Strength of the stain shows
that you didn't take milk.

144
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,719
There are traces of ketchup on it
and on your lips and sleeve.

145
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,239
Cooked breakfast, or the nearest
thing those trains manage. Sandwich.

146
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,479
How did you know
it was disappointing?

147
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
Is there any other type of breakfast
on a train? The girl.

148
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,039
Female handwriting's distinctive,
wrote her number on the napkin.

149
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,599
I can tell from the angle she wrote
at that she was sat across from you.

150
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,460
After she got off, I
imagine you used the

151
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:04,319
napkin to mop up
your spilled coffee,

152
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,119
accidentally smudging the numbers.

153
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,160
You've been over the
last four digits in

154
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:10,199
another pen, so you wanted
to keep the number.

155
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,079
You used the napkin to blow your
nose, so you're not that into her.

156
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,759
Then there's the nicotine stains on
your shaking fingers. I know the signs.

157
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,820
No chance to smoke
when on the train, no

158
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:20,879
time to roll one before
you got a cab here.

159
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,519
It's just after 9.15,
you're desperate.

160
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,199
The first train from Exeter
to London leaves at 5.46am.

161
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,320
You got the first one,
so something important

162
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:30,440
must have happened last night.
Am I wrong?

163
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,959
No.

164
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,839
You're right.

165
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,199
You're completely, exactly right.

166
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,600
Bloody hell, I heard you were quick.
It's my job. Now shut up and smoke.

167
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,999
Em.

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,879
Henry, your parents both died
and you were what, seven years old?

169
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,519
I know, that...

170
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,119
That must be quite a trauma.

171
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,799
Now, have you ever thought that maybe
you invented this story, this...

172
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,959
to account for it?

173
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,359
That's what Dr Mortimer says.

174
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,399
Who? His therapist. My therapist.

175
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,759
Obviously.

176
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,119
Louise Mortimer.

177
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,719
She's the reason
I came back to Dartmoor.

178
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,919
She thinks I have to face my demons.

179
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,239
What happened when you went back
to Dewer's Hollow last night?

180
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,400
You went there on the
advice of your therapist

181
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:36,559
and now you're
consulting a detective.

182
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,480
What did you see that
changed everything?

183
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:40,399
It's a strange
place, the Hollow.

184
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,839
It makes you feel
so cold inside, so afraid.

185
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,320
Yes, if I wanted poetry,
I'd read John's emails to

186
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:49,799
his girlfriends, much funnier.
What did you see?

187
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,239
Footprints.

188
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,519
On the exact spot
where I saw my father torn apart.

189
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,959
Man's or a woman's?

190
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,879
Neither. They were... Is that it?
Nothing else? Footprints, is that all?

191
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,079
Yes. But they were...

192
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,759
Dr Mortimer wins. It's a childhood
trauma masked by an invented memory.

193
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,640
Boring. Goodbye, Mr Knight,
thank you for smoking.

194
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:14,519
What about the footprints?

195
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,039
They're probably paw prints, could
be anything, therefore nothing.

196
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,240
Off to Devon with you
and have a cream tea on me.

197
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:24,040
Mr Holmes, they were
the footprints of a gigantic hound.

198
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,679
Say that again.

199
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,520
I found footprints, they were big...

200
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:35,119
No, no, no, your exact words.

201
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,400
Repeat your exact words from a moment
ago, exactly as you said them.

202
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,639
Mr Holmes,

203
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:49,240
they were
the footprints of a gigantic hound.

204
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,479
I'll take the case. Sorry, what?

205
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,420
Thank you for bringing
this to my attention,

206
00:12:57,421 --> 00:12:59,359
it's very promising.
Sorry, what?

207
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,599
A minute ago, footprints were boring,
now they're very promising?

208
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,660
It's got nothing to do
with footprints, you

209
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:06,719
weren't listening.
Baskerville, heard of it?

210
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,759
Vaguely. It's very hush-hush.

211
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,359
Sounds like a good place to start.
You'll come down?

212
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,678
I can't leave London
at the moment, far too busy.

213
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,080
But don't worry,
I'm putting my best man onto it.

214
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:18,240
I can always rely on John
to send me the relevant

215
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:20,399
data, as he never
understands a word of it.

216
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,760
What are you talking about?
You don't have a case!

217
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,119
You were complaining...
I've got Bluebell!

218
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,960
The case of the vanishing
glow-in-the-dark rabbit.

219
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:30,800
NATO's in uproar.
You're not coming, then?

220
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,200
OK.

221
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,880
OK.

222
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,919
I don't need those any more,
I'm going to Dartmoor.

223
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,879
You go on ahead, Henry, we'll follow
later. Sorry, so you are coming?

224
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,559
20-year-old disappearance,
a monstrous hound?

225
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,840
I wouldn't miss this for the world!

226
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,439
..cruise together, you had
no intention of taking me on a boat!

227
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,439
Looks like Mrs Hudson
finally got to the wife in Doncaster.

228
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,480
Wait until she finds out
about the one in Islamabad.

229
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,880
Paddington Station, please.

230
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,640
There's Baskerville.

231
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,159
That's Grimpen Village.

232
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,759
So that must be...

233
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,599
Yes, Dewer's Hollow.

234
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,279
What's that?

235
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,919
A mine field?

236
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,519
Technically,
Baskerville's an army base,

237
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,439
so I guess they've always been keen
to keep people out.

238
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,840
Clearly.

239
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,439
Right, three tours a day.
Tell your friends, tell anyone.

240
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,719
Don't be strangers. And remember,
stay away from the moor at night,

241
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,039
if you value your lives!
Take care.

242
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,160
It's cold.

243
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,400
That part doesn't change.

244
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,600
What does?

245
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,160
There's something else.
It's a word.

246
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,319
Liberty.

247
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,439
Liberty?

248
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,480
And there's another word.

249
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,599
In.

250
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,040
I. N.

251
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,360
Liberty In.
What do you think it means?

252
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,439
Sorry we couldn't do
a double room for you boys.

253
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,119
That's fine. We're not...

254
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,039
There you go.

255
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,160
Ta. I'll just get your change.
Ta.

256
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,599
There you go.

257
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,119
I couldn't help noticing, on the map
of the moor, a skull and crossbones?

258
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,560
That.

259
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,759
Pirates? No. The Great Grimpen
Minefield, they call it. Right.

260
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,319
It's not what you think.
It's the Baskerville testing site.

261
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,119
It's been going for 80-odd years.

262
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,279
I'm not sure anyone really knows
what's there any more.

263
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,079
Explosives? Not just explosives.

264
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,300
Break into that place
and if you're lucky,

265
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,519
you just get blown
up, so they say.

266
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,199
In case you're planning
a wee stroll. Ta. I'll remember.

267
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,359
Aye. No, it buggers up tourism a bit,
so thank God for the demon hound.

268
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,319
Did you see that show? The
documentary? Quite recently, yeah.

269
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,680
God bless Henry Knight
and his monster from hell.

270
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:38,839
Ever seen it? The hound?
Me? No, no.

271
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,359
Fletcher has.

272
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,999
He runs the walks, the monster walks for
the tourists, you know. He's seen it.

273
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,679
That's handy for trade.

274
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,040
I'm just saying we've been
rushed off our feet, Billy.

275
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,399
Yeah, lots of monster hunters.

276
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,799
It don't take much these days,
one mention on Twitter and whoomph!

277
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,319
We're out of WKD.

278
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,319
Right. What with the monster
and the ruddy prison,

279
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,239
I don't know how we sleep nights.

280
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,759
Do you, Gary? Like a baby.

281
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,879
That's not true. He's a snorer.
Hey, ssh.

282
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,239
Is yours a snorer? Got any crisps?

283
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,200
Yeah. No. All right? Right,
take care. Bye. Take care, bye.

284
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,600
Mind if I join you?

285
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,719
It's not true, is it, you haven't
actually seen this hound thing?

286
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,559
Are you from the papers? No,
nothing like that, just curious.

287
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,119
Have you seen it? Maybe.

288
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,079
Got any proof?

289
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,799
Why would I tell you if I did?
Excuse me.

290
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,519
I called Henry. Bet's off John,
sorry. What? Bet?

291
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,820
My plan needs darkness.
We've got another

292
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,119
half an hour of light.
Wait, wait, what bet?

293
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,919
I bet John here 50 quid that you
couldn't prove you'd seen the hound.

294
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,839
Yeah, the guys in the pub
said you could.

295
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,320
Well, you're going to lose
your money, mate. Yeah?

296
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:05,039
Yeah. I seen it.

297
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,200
Only about a month ago.
Up at the Hollow.

298
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:09,359
It was foggy, mind,
couldn't make much out.

299
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,319
I see. No witnesses, I suppose.
No, but... Never are.

300
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,319
No, wait. There.

301
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,719
Is that it? It's not exactly proof,
is it? Sorry, John, I win.

302
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,119
Wait, wait, that's not all. People
don't like going up there, you know.

303
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,479
To the Hollow.

304
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,799
Gives them a bad sort of feeling.

305
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,039
Is it haunted?
Is that supposed to convince me?

306
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,639
Nah, don't be stupid!
Nothing like that.

307
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,399
But I reckon
there is something out there.

308
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,319
Something from Baskerville, escaped.

309
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,759
A clone? A super-dog? Maybe.

310
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,760
God knows what they've
been spraying on us

311
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:48,759
all these years, or
putting in the water.

312
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,879
I wouldn't trust them
as far as I could spit.

313
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,320
Is that the best you've got?

314
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,439
I had a mate once
who worked for the MOD.

315
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,479
One weekend we were meant to go
fishing, but he never showed up.

316
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,959
Well, not till late.

317
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,679
When he did,
he was white as a sheet.

318
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,559
I can see him now.

319
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,439
"I've seen things today,
Fletcher," he said,

320
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,639
"that I never want to see again.

321
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,479
"Terrible things."

322
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,479
He'd been sent to some secret
army place. Porton Down, maybe.

323
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,799
Maybe Baskerville,
or somewhere else.

324
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,959
In the labs there,
the really secret labs,

325
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,840
he said he'd seen terrible things.

326
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,479
Rats as big as dogs, he said.

327
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,880
And dogs, dogs the size of horses.

328
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,240
We did say 50.

329
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,240
Ta.

330
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,720
Pass, please.

331
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,759
Thank you.

332
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,319
You've got ID for Baskerville?!

333
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,639
How?

334
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,399
It's not specific to this place.
It's my brother's.

335
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,560
Access all areas. I, um, ahem,
acquired it ages ago. Just in case.

336
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,279
Brilliant. What's the matter?
We'll get caught. We won't!

337
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,319
Well, not yet.
Caught in five minutes.

338
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,799
"Hi, we thought we'd have a wander
around your top secret weapons base."

339
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,399
"Really? Great. Come in, kettle's
boiled." That's if we don't get shot.

340
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,640
Clear. Thanks very much. Thank you.

341
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,719
Straight through, sir.
Mycroft's name literally opens doors.

342
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,399
I've told you, he practically is
the British Government.

343
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,440
I reckon we've got about 20 minutes
before they realise something's wrong.

344
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,599
What is it? Are we in trouble?
Are we in trouble, sir.

345
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,639
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
You were expecting us?

346
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,959
Your ID showed up straight away,
Mr Holmes. Corporal Lyons, security.

347
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,740
Is there something wrong, sir?
I hope not,

348
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:06,519
Corporal, I hope not.
We don't get inspected here.

349
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,920
Ever heard of a spot check?

350
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:11,959
Captain John Watson,
Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. Sir.

351
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,239
Major Barrymore won't be pleased,
sir. He'll want to see you both.

352
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,799
I'm afraid we won't have time.
We need the full tour.

353
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,600
Right away. Carry on.
That's an order, Corporal. Yes, sir.

354
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,479
Nice touch.
Haven't pulled rank in ages.

355
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,160
Enjoy it? Yeah.

356
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,559
How many animals do you keep down
here? Lots, sir.

357
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,839
Any ever escape? They'd have to know
how to use that lift, sir.

358
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,879
We're not breeding them that clever.
Unless they have help.

359
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,119
And you are? It's all right,
Dr Frankland,

360
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,759
I'm just showing these gentlemen
around. New faces, how nice.

361
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,040
Careful you don't get stuck here,
though, I only came to fix a tap.

362
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,519
How far down does that lift go?
Quite a way, sir.

363
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,479
And what's down there?

364
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,199
Well, we have to keep
the bins somewhere, sir.

365
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,880
This way please, gentlemen.

366
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,239
So what exactly is it that you do
here?

367
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,159
I thought you'd know, sir,
this being an inspection.

368
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,679
Well, I'm not an expert, am I?

369
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,279
Everything from stem cell research to
trying to cure the common cold, sir.

370
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,559
But mostly weaponry?
Of one sort or another, yes.

371
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,719
Biological, chemical? One war ends,
another begins, sir.

372
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,879
New enemies to fight.
We have to be prepared.

373
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,399
OK, Michael,
let's try Harlow 3 next time.

374
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,319
Dr Stapleton... Stapleton?

375
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,239
Yes? Who's this?

376
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,239
Priority ultra, ma'am, orders from
on high. An inspection. Really?

377
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,460
We are to be accorded every
courtesy, Dr Stapleton.

378
00:26:43,461 --> 00:26:45,679
What's your role at Baskerville?

379
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,719
Accorded every courtesy,
isn't that the idea?

380
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,839
I'm not free to say.
Official secrets.

381
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,759
You most certainly are free,
and I suggest you remain that way.

382
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,199
I have a lot of fingers
in a lot of pies.

383
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,199
I like to mix things up.

384
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,839
Genes, mostly.
Now and again, actual fingers.

385
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,439
Stapleton! I knew I knew your name.

386
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,479
I doubt it.

387
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,959
People say there's no such thing
as coincidence.

388
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,520
Dull lives they must lead.

389
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,620
Have you been talking
to my daughter?

390
00:27:21,621 --> 00:27:23,559
Why did Bluebell have
to die, Dr Stapleton?

391
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,800
The rabbit?
Disappeared from inside a locked

392
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:28,039
hutch, which was always suggestive.
The rabbit?

393
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,920
Clearly an inside job.
You reckon?

394
00:27:29,921 --> 00:27:32,239
Why? Because it glowed in the dark.

395
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,719
I have absolutely no idea what
you're talking about. Who are you?

396
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,919
We've seen enough for now.
Thank you so much. That's it?

397
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,159
That's it. It's this way, isn't it?

398
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,679
Just a minute!

399
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,479
Did we just break into a military
base to investigate a rabbit?

400
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,480
Ha! 23 minutes.
Mycroft's getting slow.

401
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,520
Hello, again.

402
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,799
Major...

403
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,119
This is bloody outrageous!
Why wasn't I told?!

404
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,759
Major Barrymore, is it?
Yes, well, good.

405
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,479
Very good, we're very impressed.
Aren't we, Mr Holmes?

406
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,180
Hugely. The point of
Baskerville was to eliminate

407
00:28:50,181 --> 00:28:52,879
bureaucratic nonsense!
Sorry, Major. Inspections!

408
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,720
Can't remain unmonitored
for ever, goodness

409
00:28:55,721 --> 00:28:58,559
knows what you'd get up to.
Keep walking. Sir!

410
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,439
ID unauthorised, sir. What?
I've just had the call.

411
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,639
Is that right? Who are you?

412
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,119
Look, there's obviously been
some kind of mistake.

413
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,559
Clearly not, Mycroft Holmes.

414
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,320
Computer error.
It'll all have to go in the report.

415
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:15,079
What the hell's going on?

416
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,999
It's all right, Major,
I know who these gentlemen are.

417
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,719
You do? Yeah,
I'm getting a little slow on faces,

418
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,199
but Mr Holmes here isn't someone
I expected to show up in this place.

419
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,319
Well... Good to see you again,
Mycroft.

420
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,580
I had the honour of
meeting Mr Holmes at

421
00:29:31,581 --> 00:29:34,840
the WHO conference in...
Brussels, was it?

422
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,399
Vienna. Vienna, that's it.

423
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,600
This is Mr Mycroft Holmes, Major.
There's obviously been a mistake.

424
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,919
On your head be it, Dr Frankland.

425
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,800
I'll show them out, Corporal.
Very well, sir.

426
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,319
Thank you.

427
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,279
This is about Henry Knight,
isn't it? I thought so.

428
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,020
I knew he wanted help,
but I didn't realise

429
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:13,759
he was going to contact
Sherlock Holmes!

430
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,680
Don't worry, I know
who you really are.

431
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:17,599
I'm never off your website.

432
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,239
I thought you'd be wearing the hat.
That wasn't my hat.

433
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,999
I hardly recognise him
without the hat. It wasn't my hat.

434
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,159
I love the blog, too, Dr Watson.
Cheers.

435
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,119
The pink thing. And that one about
the aluminium crutch. Yes.

436
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,599
You know Henry Knight?
Well, I knew his dad better.

437
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,439
He had all sorts of mad theories
about this place.

438
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,479
Still, he was a good friend.

439
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,519
Listen, I can't really talk now.

440
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,719
Here's my cell number.

441
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,039
If I can help with Henry,
give me a call.

442
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,239
I never did ask, Dr Frankland,
what exactly is it that you do here?

443
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,239
Mr Holmes,
I would love to tell you,

444
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,159
but then, of course,
I'd have to kill you.

445
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,039
That would be tremendously ambitious
of you. Tell me about Dr Stapleton.

446
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,159
I never speak ill of a colleague.

447
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,639
But you'd speak well of one,
which you're clearly omitting to do.

448
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,759
I do seem to be, don't I?

449
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,360
I'll be in touch. Any time.

450
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,279
So? So?

451
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,359
What was all that about the rabbit?

452
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,199
Please,
can we not do this, this time?

453
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,199
Do what? You being all mysterious
with your... cheekbones,

454
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,359
and turning your coat collar up
so you look cool.

455
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,480
I don't do that. Yeah, you do.

456
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,999
So, the email from Kirsty.
The missing luminous rabbit.

457
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,079
Kirsty Stapleton, whose mother
specialises in genetic manipulation.

458
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,799
She made her daughter's rabbit
glow in the dark?

459
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,159
Probably a fluorescent gene.

460
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,599
Removed and spliced into the
specimen. Simple enough, these days.

461
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,159
So?

462
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:13,519
So we know that Dr Stapleton performs
secret genetic experiments on animals.

463
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,760
The question is, has she been working
on something deadlier than a rabbit?

464
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,120
To be fair,
that is quite a wide field.

465
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,959
Hi. Hi.

466
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,760
Come in, come in.

467
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,680
This is...

468
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,839
Are you, um, rich?

469
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,400
Yeah. Right.

470
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:12,359
There's a couple of words,
it's what I keep seeing.

471
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,159
Liberty.

472
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,360
Liberty? Liberty. And...

473
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,600
In.

474
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,319
It's just that.

475
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,760
Have you finished?

476
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,160
Mean anything to you?
Liberty in death, isn't

477
00:33:32,161 --> 00:33:34,640
that the expression?
The only true freedom.

478
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,679
What now, then?

479
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,519
Sherlock's... got a plan? Yes.

480
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,919
Right. We take you back out
onto the moor.

481
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,479
OK... And see if
anything attacks you. What?

482
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,399
That should bring things to a head.
At night?

483
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,159
You want me to go out there
at night? That's your plan?

484
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,679
Brilliant! Got any better ideas?
That's not a plan.

485
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,840
If there is a monster out
there, John, there's

486
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:05,000
only one thing to do.
Find out where it lives.

487
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,440
(Sherlock.)

488
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,520
(U, M, Q, R, A. Umqra?)

489
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,080
(Sherlock.)

490
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,519
(Sherlock.)

491
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,919
(Sherlock?)

492
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,519
Met a friend of yours? What?

493
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,239
Dr Frankland?

494
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,519
Right. Bob, yeah.

495
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,359
He seems pretty concerned about you.

496
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,959
He's a worrier, bless him.

497
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,119
He's been very kind to me
since I came back.

498
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,279
He knew your father? Yeah.

499
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,999
But he works at Baskerville. Didn't
your dad have a problem with that?

500
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,799
Well, mates are mates, aren't
they? I mean, look at you and John.

501
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,479
What about us?

502
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,839
Well, I mean, he's a pretty
straightforward bloke and you...

503
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:41,520
Well, they agreed never to talk
about work, Uncle Bob and my dad.

504
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,960
Dewer's Hollow.

505
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,360
(Sherlock.)

506
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,239
My god, my god,
my god! My god! My god!

507
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,120
Did you see it?

508
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,759
Did you hear that? We saw it.
We saw it!

509
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,520
No, I didn't see anything.

510
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,079
What? What are you talking about?

511
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,440
I didn't see anything.

512
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,959
Look, he must have seen it.

513
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,559
I saw it. He must have.
He must have.

514
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,759
I... Why? Why?
Why would he say that?

515
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,279
It was there, it was.

516
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,479
Henry, Henry, I need you
to sit down. Try and relax, please.

517
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,439
I'm OK, I feel OK. I'm going to give you
something to help you sleep. All right?

518
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,759
This is good news, John.

519
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,479
It's... it's... it's good.

520
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,239
I'm not crazy.

521
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:37,559
There is a hound there, there is.

522
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:43,360
And Sherlock, he saw it too.
No matter what he says, he saw it.

523
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,879
Well, he's in a pretty bad way.
He's manic.

524
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,839
Totally convinced there's some
mutant super-dog roaming the moors.

525
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,639
And there isn't, though, is there?

526
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,559
If people knew how to make
a mutant super-dog, we'd know.

527
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,839
It'd be for sale.
I mean, that's how it works.

528
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:15,159
Listen, on the moor I saw
someone signalling, Morse.

529
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,559
I guess it's Morse.
It doesn't seem to make much sense.

530
00:40:19,761 --> 00:40:24,840
U, M, Q, R, A,
does that mean anything?

531
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,359
So, OK, what have we got?

532
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,199
We know there's footprints,
because Henry found them,

533
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,599
and so did the tour guide bloke.

534
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,240
We all heard something.

535
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,439
Maybe we should just look for
whoever's got a big dog.

536
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,600
Henry's right. What?

537
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,799
I saw it, too.

538
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,959
What? I saw it too, John.

539
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,759
Just... just a minute, you saw what?

540
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,520
A hound. Out there in the Hollow.

541
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,960
A gigantic hound.

542
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:13,279
Look, Sherlock,
we have to be rational about this.

543
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,599
OK, now you,
of all people, can't just...

544
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,039
Let's just stick to what we know,
yes? Stick to the facts.

545
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,340
Once you've ruled out the
impossible, whatever

546
00:41:25,341 --> 00:41:27,639
remains, however
improbable, must be true.

547
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,480
What does that mean?

548
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,199
Look at me, I'm afraid, John.

549
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,879
Afraid.

550
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,039
Sherlock.

551
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,639
I've always been able to
keep myself distant.

552
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,239
Divorce myself from feelings.

553
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,199
But look, you see,
body's betraying me.

554
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,919
Interesting, yes, emotions.

555
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,679
The grit on the lens,
the fly in the ointment.

556
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,079
Yeah, all right, Spock,
just... take it easy.

557
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,959
You've been pretty wired lately,
you know you have.

558
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,239
I think you've just gone out there
and got yourself a bit worked up.

559
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,759
Worked up?

560
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,040
It was dark and scary.

561
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:18,240
Me? There's nothing wrong with me.

562
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,680
Sherlock...

563
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,280
Sherl... There is nothing wrong
with me! Do you understand!?

564
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,880
You want me to prove it, yes?

565
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,200
We're looking for a dog, yes?
A great big dog,

566
00:42:46,201 --> 00:42:48,479
that's your brilliant theory.
Cherchez le chien!

567
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,999
Where shall we start?
How about them?

568
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,159
The sentimental widow and her son,
the unemployed fisherman.

569
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,420
The answer's yes. Yes?
She's got a West Highland

570
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:58,679
Terrier called Whisky, not
what we're looking for!

571
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,460
For God's sake!
Look at his jumper, hardly worn.

572
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:02,239
Clearly he's uncomfortable.

573
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,039
Could be the material or the hideous
pattern, suggests it's a present.

574
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,679
He wants into his mother's
good books. Why? Probably money.

575
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,359
He's treating her to a meal,
but his own portion is small.

576
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,400
He wants to impress her,
but he's trying to

577
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:15,439
economise on his own food.
Maybe he's not hungry.

578
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,680
No, small plate, starter.
He's practically licked it clean.

579
00:43:17,681 --> 00:43:19,919
She's nearly finished
her pavlova.

580
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,240
If she'd treated him,
he'd have had as much as he wanted.

581
00:43:22,241 --> 00:43:25,479
He's hungry and not well-off, you
can tell by his cuffs and shoes.

582
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,199
Only a mother would give him
a Christmas present like that.

583
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,079
It could be an aunt or older
sister, but mother's more likely.

584
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,239
He was a fisherman, the scarring on
his hands is distinctive, fish hooks.

585
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,599
They're old,
suggesting long-term unemployment.

586
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,919
Not much industry here, so he's turned
to his widowed mother for help. Widowed?

587
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,780
She's got a man's
wedding ring on a chain

588
00:43:41,781 --> 00:43:43,639
around her neck, clearly
her late husband's

589
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,380
and too big for her finger.

590
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:47,119
She's well-dressed, but
her jewellery is cheap.

591
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,560
She could afford better,
but she's kept it, sentimental.

592
00:43:49,561 --> 00:43:52,639
The dog? There are tiny hairs on her
leg but none above the knees,

593
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,199
suggesting it's a small dog,
probably a terrier.

594
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,479
It is a West Highland Terrier called
Whisky. "How do you know that?"

595
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,420
She was on the same
train as us and I heard

596
00:44:00,421 --> 00:44:02,359
her call its name.
That's listening.

597
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,039
I use my senses, unlike some people,
so you see, I am fine.

598
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,040
In fact, I've never been better,
so just leave me alone!

599
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,560
Yeah, OK.

600
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,480
OK.

601
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,079
Why would you listen to me? I'm just
your friend. I don't have friends.

602
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,560
No.

603
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,720
I wonder why.

604
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,360
Mr Selden,
you've done it again!

605
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,999
I keep catching it with my belt.

606
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,080
God!

607
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,560
So?

608
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,640
You're a bad man.

609
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,960
That's so mean!

610
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,039
More wine, doctor? Are you
trying to get me drunk, doctor?

611
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,359
The thought never occurred.

612
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,660
Because a while ago I thought
you were chatting me up.

613
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:12,959
Where did I go wrong?

614
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,900
When you started asking
about my patients.

615
00:48:14,901 --> 00:48:16,839
Well, I am one of
Henry's oldest friends.

616
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,599
Yeah, and he's one of my
patients, so I can't talk about him.

617
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,719
Although he has told me
about all his oldest friends.

618
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,360
Which one are you? A new one?

619
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,959
OK, what about his father?
He wasn't one of your patients.

620
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,119
Wasn't he some sort of
conspiracy nutter... theorist?

621
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,119
You're only a nutter if
you're wrong. And was he wrong?

622
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,519
I should think so. But he got
fixated on Baskerville, didn't he?

623
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,799
With what they were doing in there.

624
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,239
Couldn't Henry have gone the
same way, started imagining a hound?

625
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,319
Why do you think
I'll talk about this?

626
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:51,999
Because I think you're worried about
him and because I'm a doctor too.

627
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,600
And because I have another friend
who might be having the same problem.

628
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,719
Dr Watson! Hi. Hello.

629
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,159
How's the investigation going?
Hello.

630
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,479
What, investigation?

631
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,719
Didn't you know? Don't you read
the blog? Sherlock Holmes.

632
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,799
It's... Sherlock who?

633
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,999
Private detective. This is his PA.

634
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,079
PA? Well, live-in PA. Perfect!

635
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,399
Live-in..?

636
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,119
This is Dr Mortimer,
Henry's therapist.

637
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,599
Hello. Bob Frankland.

638
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,279
Listen, tell Sherlock I've been
keeping an eye on Stapleton.

639
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,719
Any time he wants a little chat.
All right?

640
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,720
Why don't you buy him a drink?
I think he likes you.

641
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,039
Morning!
How are you feeling?

642
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,799
I...

643
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,079
I didn't sleep very well.
That's a shame.

644
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,840
Shall I make us some coffee?
Look, you've got damp!

645
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,840
Listen, last night...

646
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,319
Why did you say
you hadn't seen anything?

647
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,519
I mean, I only saw the hound
for a minute, but... Hound?

648
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,399
What? Why do you call it a hound?
Why a hound?

649
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,519
Why? What do you mean?
It's odd, isn't it?

650
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,599
It's a strange choice of words,
archaic.

651
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,780
That's why I took the case.
"Mr Holmes, they

652
00:51:00,781 --> 00:51:02,959
were the footprints
of a gigantic hound."

653
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,039
Why say "hound"?

654
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,720
I don't know, I've never...

655
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,720
Actually, I'd better skip
the coffee.

656
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,359
Did you get anywhere
with that Morse code?

657
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,679
Nah.

658
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,879
U, M, Q, R, A, wasn't it? Umqra.

659
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,799
Nothing. Qra...

660
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,879
Look, forget it. I thought
I was onto something, I wasn't.

661
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,559
Sure? Yeah.

662
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,719
How about Louise Mortimer,
did you get anywhere with her? No.

663
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,679
Too bad.
But did you get any information?

664
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,239
You're being funny now?

665
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,279
Thought it might break the ice,
a bit.

666
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,919
Funny doesn't suit you.
Let's stick to ice.

667
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,559
John... It's fine.

668
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,740
Wait, something happened
to me last night,

669
00:52:10,741 --> 00:52:12,919
something I've not
experienced before.

670
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,380
Yes, you said. Fear, Sherlock
Holmes got scared, you said.

671
00:52:15,381 --> 00:52:17,839
It was more than that, John.
It was doubt.

672
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,439
I felt doubt.

673
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,580
I've always been able
to trust my senses, the

674
00:52:21,581 --> 00:52:23,719
evidence of my own eyes,
until last night.

675
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,220
You can't actually believe
that you saw some

676
00:52:26,221 --> 00:52:28,719
kind of monster?
No, I can't believe that.

677
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,400
But I did see it,
so the question is, how? How?

678
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,279
Yes.

679
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,079
Yeah, right, good.

680
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:41,080
So you've got something to
go on, then. Good luck with that.

681
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,559
Listen, what I said before, John,
I meant it.

682
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,239
I don't have friends.

683
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,480
I've just got one.

684
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,720
Right.

685
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,440
John.

686
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,919
John! You are amazing!
You are fantastic!

687
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,159
Yes, all right,
you don't have to overdo it.

688
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,760
You may not be the most
luminous of people, but as a

689
00:53:09,761 --> 00:53:12,359
- conductor of light, you are unbeatable.
- Cheers What?

690
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,700
Some people who aren't
geniuses have an ability

691
00:53:14,701 --> 00:53:17,039
to stimulate it in others.
You were saying sorry.

692
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,440
Don't spoil it. So what have I done
that's so bloody stimulating?

693
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,039
Yeah?

694
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,879
What if it's not a word,
what if it is individual letters?

695
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,679
You think it's an acronym?

696
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,600
Absolutely no idea, but...

697
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,999
- What the hell are you doing here?!
- Nice to see you too

698
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,039
I'm on holiday, would you believe?
No, I wouldn't.

699
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,399
Hello, John. Greg.

700
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,600
I heard you were in the area.
What are you up to?

701
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:45,759
Are you after this Hound of Hell,
like on the telly?

702
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,980
I'm waiting for an explanation,
Inspector, why are you here?

703
00:53:47,981 --> 00:53:50,199
I've told you, I'm on holiday.

704
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,560
You're brown as a nut.
You're clearly just back

705
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:54,919
from your holidays.
I fancied another one.

706
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,399
This is Mycroft, isn't it?
Now, look... Of course it is.

707
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,159
One mention of Baskerville and he sends
down my handler to spy on me, incognito.

708
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,479
Is that why you're calling
yourself "Greg"? That's his name.

709
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,519
Is it? Yes.
If you'd ever bothered to find out.

710
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,960
Look, I'm not your handler.

711
00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:13,519
And I just don't do
what your brother tells me.

712
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,879
Actually, you could be just the man
we want. Why?

713
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,079
Well, I've not been idle, Sherlock.

714
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,999
I think I might have found something.
Here.

715
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,719
I didn't know if it was relevant.

716
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,860
Starting to look
like it might be.

717
00:54:25,861 --> 00:54:27,999
That is an awful lot of meat
for a vegetarian restaurant.

718
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,079
Excellent.

719
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,680
A nice, scary inspector
from Scotland Yard, who

720
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:34,279
can put in a few calls,
might come in very handy.

721
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,560
Shop.

722
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,639
What's this?

723
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,159
Coffee. I made coffee.
You never make coffee.

724
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,320
Don't you want it?
You don't have to keep apologising.

725
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,160
Thanks.

726
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,120
I don't take sugar.

727
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,399
These records go back
nearly two months.

728
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,079
That's nice. It's good.

729
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,119
Is that when you had the idea,
after the TV show went out?

730
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,039
It's me. It was me.

731
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,159
I'm sorry, Gary. I couldn't help it.

732
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,999
I had a bacon sandwich at Cal's wedding
and one thing led to another. Nice try.

733
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,279
Look, we were just trying to give
things a bit of a boost, you know?

734
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,119
Let a great big dog run wild up
on the moor, it was heaven-sent.

735
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,799
It was like us
having our own Loch Ness monster.

736
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,919
And where do you keep it? There's
an old mine shaft. It's not too far.

737
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,079
He was all right there. Was?

738
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,720
We couldn't control
the bloody thing. It was vicious.

739
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,639
And then, a month ago,

740
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:01,919
Billy took him to the vet
and, you know...

741
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,080
He's dead?

742
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,319
Put down.

743
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,999
Yeah. No choice.

744
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,679
So it's over.

745
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,839
It was just a joke, you know.

746
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,359
Yeah, hilarious

747
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:17,120
You've nearly driven
a man out of his mind.

748
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:38,119
You know he's actually pleased
you're here? Secretly pleased.

749
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,559
Is he?

750
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,199
That's nice.

751
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,519
I suppose he likes having
all the same faces back together.

752
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:48,199
Appeals to his... his...

753
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,919
Asperger's?

754
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,239
So, you believe them about having
the dog destroyed? No reason not to.

755
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,479
Well, hopefully
there's no harm done.

756
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,780
I'm not quite sure what I'd
charge them with, anyway.

757
00:56:57,781 --> 00:57:00,079
I'll have a word with
the local force.

758
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,199
Right, that's that, then.
Catch you later.

759
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:07,039
I'm enjoying this. It's nice
to get London out of your lungs.

760
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,399
So that was their dog that people
saw out on the moor? Looks like it.

761
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,479
But that wasn't what you saw,
that wasn't just an ordinary dog.

762
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,680
No. It was immense.

763
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,239
It had burning red eyes,
and it was glowing, John,

764
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,400
its whole body was glowing.

765
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:27,119
I've got a theory, but I need to get
back into Baskerville to test it.

766
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,119
How? Can't pull off
the ID trick again.

767
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,360
Might not have to.

768
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,520
Hello, brother, dear. How ARE you?

769
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,799
Afternoon, sir.
Can you turn the engine off?

770
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,839
Thank you.

771
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,439
I need to see Major Barrymore
as soon as we get inside.

772
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,159
Right. Which means you'll have to
start the search for the hound. OK.

773
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,599
In the labs.

774
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,559
Stapleton's first.

775
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,120
It could be dangerous.

776
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,840
You know I'd love to

777
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:35,119
I'd love to give you unlimited
access to this place. Why not?

778
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,919
It's a simple enough request, Major.
I've never heard of anything so bizarre.

779
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:43,799
You're to give me 24 hours, it's what
I negotiated, not a second more.

780
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,039
I may have to comply with this
order, but I don't have to like it.

781
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,140
I don't know what the hell you
expect to find here, anyway.

782
00:58:49,141 --> 00:58:51,239
Perhaps the truth. About what?

783
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,479
I see.

784
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,359
The big coat should have told me.

785
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,439
You're one of the conspiracy lot,
aren't you?

786
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,240
Well, then, go ahead, seek them out,

787
00:59:00,241 --> 00:59:03,959
the monsters, the death rays,
the aliens.

788
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,079
Have you got any of those?

789
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,480
Just wondering.

790
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:12,599
A couple.
Crash landed here in the '60s.

791
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,919
We call them Abbott and Costello.

792
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,000
Good luck, Mr Holmes.

793
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,599
God!

794
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,400
God!

795
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,280
Come on.

796
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,840
Hello?

797
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,439
No, come on. Come on.

798
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,039
(No... Don't be ridiculous.)

799
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,519
(Pick up.)

800
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,000
Damn it.

801
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,560
(Right.)

802
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,839
(It's here. It's in here with me.)

803
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,999
'Where are you?'

804
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,759
(Get me out, Sherlock,
you've got to get me out.)

805
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,320
(The big lab,
the first lab that we saw.)

806
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,719
'John... John?'

807
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,680
(Now, Sherlock! Please!)

808
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,359
'All right, I'll find you.
Keep talking.'

809
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,279
(I can't, it'll hear me.)

810
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:25,600
'Keep talking. What are you seeing?

811
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,919
'John?'

812
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,279
(Yes, I'm here.)

813
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,800
'What can you see?'

814
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:42,360
(I don't know. I don't know,
but I can hear it now.)

815
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,439
(Did you hear that?)

816
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,600
'Stay calm, stay calm.
Can you see it?

817
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,999
'Can you see it?'

818
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,599
(No, I can't.)

819
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,680
I can see it.

820
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,560
(I can see it.)

821
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,680
(It's here.)

822
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,639
Are you all right? John?

823
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,159
Jesus Christ! It was the hound!

824
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,879
Sherlock, it was here, I swear it,
Sherlock, it must, it must...

825
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,079
Did-did you see it? You must have!

826
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,319
It's all right, it's OK now.

827
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:29,039
NO, IT'S NOT! IT'S NOT OK!

828
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,519
I saw it, I was wrong!

829
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,439
Well, let's not jump
to conclusions. What?

830
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,759
What did you see? I told you, I saw
the hound? Huge, red eyes? Yes.

831
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,919
Glowing? Yeah.

832
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,359
No. What?

833
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,159
I made up the bit about glowing.

834
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,799
You saw what you expected to see
because I told you.

835
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,759
You have been drugged.
We have all been drugged. Drugged?

836
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,660
Can you walk?
Of course I can walk.

837
01:06:48,661 --> 01:06:50,560
Come on, then.
It's time to lay this ghost.

838
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:02,239
Back again?
What's on your mind this time?

839
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,679
Murder, Dr Stapleton.

840
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,720
Refined, cold-blooded murder.

841
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:14,520
Will you tell little Kirsty what
happened to Bluebell, or shall I?

842
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,879
OK. What do you want?

843
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,920
Can I borrow your microscope?

844
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,439
Are you sure you're OK?
You look very peaky.

845
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,960
No, I'm all right.

846
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:47,879
It was the GFP gene from a jellyfish,
in case you're interested. What?

847
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,439
In the rabbits. Right, yeah.

848
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:53,799
Aequorea victoria,
if you really want to know.

849
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,319
Why? Why not?

850
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:59,239
We don't ask questions like that
here. It isn't done.

851
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:03,079
It was a mix-up, anyway. My daughter
ended up with one of the lab specimens,

852
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:06,119
so poor Bluebell had to go.

853
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:09,559
Your compassion is overwhelming!
I know.

854
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,000
I hate myself sometimes.

855
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:16,079
So, come on, then, you can trust me,
I'm a doctor,

856
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,879
what else have you got
hidden away up here?

857
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,239
Listen, if you can imagine it,

858
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:26,679
someone is probably doing it
somewhere. Of course they are.

859
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:30,439
Cloning? Yes, of course.
Dolly the Sheep, remember?

860
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,440
Human cloning? Why not?

861
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:38,400
And what about animals? Not sheep.

862
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,959
Big animals.

863
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,239
Size isn't a problem. Not at all.

864
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,820
The only limits are
ethics and the law and

865
01:08:46,821 --> 01:08:49,399
both those things can
be very flexible.

866
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,559
But not here, not at Baskerville.
It's not there!

867
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,479
Jesus! Nothing there!
It doesn't make any sense!

868
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,079
What were you expecting to find?

869
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,199
A drug, of course.
It has to be a drug.

870
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,879
An hallucinogenic
or a deliriant of some kind.

871
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,999
There's no trace of anything
in the sugar. Sugar? Sugar, yes.

872
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,580
A simple process of elimination.
I saw the hound,

873
01:09:07,581 --> 01:09:10,159
saw it as my imagination
expected me to see it.

874
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,999
A genetically engineered monster.

875
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,559
I knew I couldn't believe my eyes, so
there were seven possible reasons,

876
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,999
the most possible being narcotics.

877
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,839
Henry Knight, he saw it too, but
you didn't, John. You didn't see it.

878
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,860
We have eaten and drunk
the same things since

879
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:27,879
we got to Grimpen,
apart from one thing.

880
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,159
You don't take sugar in your coffee.
I see, so?

881
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:33,999
I took it from Henry's kitchen,
his sugar.

882
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,999
It's perfectly all right.

883
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,360
But maybe it's not a drug.
No, it has to be a drug.

884
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:43,080
How did it get into our systems?
How?

885
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,999
There has to be something,
something...

886
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,800
Something...

887
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,479
Something buried deep.

888
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,999
Get out. What?

889
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,160
Get out, I need to go to
my mind palace. Your what?

890
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:05,839
He's not going to be doing much talking
for a while, we may as well go.

891
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,319
His what? His "mind palace".

892
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,639
It's a memory technique,
a sort of mental map.

893
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,879
You plot a map with a location,
it doesn't have to be a real place.

894
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,439
You deposit memories there.

895
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,380
Theoretically, you
never forget anything.

896
01:10:20,381 --> 01:10:22,319
All you do is find
your way back to it.

897
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,799
So this imaginary location could be
anything, a house or a street? Yeah.

898
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,680
But he said "palace", he
said it was a palace?

899
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:29,560
Yeah, well, he would,
wouldn't he?

900
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:14,920
? You ain't nothing... ?

901
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,240
Hound.

902
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,439
My god!

903
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:05,760
My god! My god! I am so...
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

904
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,199
John? Yeah, I'm on it.

905
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:30,599
Project HOUND. I must have
read about it, stored it away.

906
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,599
An experiment in
a CIA facility in Liberty, Indiana.

907
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,880
H-O-U-N-D.

908
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,879
That's as far as my access goes,
I'm afraid.

909
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,879
There must be an override,
a password?

910
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,160
I imagine so,
but that'd be Major Barrymore's.

911
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,679
Password, password. Password.

912
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,680
He sat here when he thought it up.

913
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,919
Describe him to me? You've seen him.
But describe him.

914
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:11,759
He's a bloody martinet, a throw-back,
the sort they'd have sent into Suez.

915
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,340
Good, excellent, old-fashioned.
Traditionalist.

916
01:13:14,341 --> 01:13:16,919
Not the sort to use his
children's name as a password.

917
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,719
He loves his job, proud of it and this
is work-related. So what's at eye level?

918
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,359
Books.

919
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,399
Jane's Defence Weekly, bound copies.
Hannibal.

920
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,880
Wellington. Rommel.
Churchill's History of the

921
01:13:27,881 --> 01:13:30,359
English-Speaking Peoples,
all four volumes.

922
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:33,439
Churchill, he's fond of Churchill.

923
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,420
Copy of The Downing Street
Years, one to five.

924
01:13:35,421 --> 01:13:37,399
Separate biographies
of Thatcher.

925
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,439
Mid-1980s, at a guess.
Father and son.

926
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,740
Barrymore Senior, medals,
Distinguished Service Order.

927
01:13:42,741 --> 01:13:45,039
That date, I'd say
Falklands veteran.

928
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:48,839
Right, Thatcher's a more likely bet
than Churchill. That's the password?

929
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,400
No! With a man like Major Barrymore,
only first name terms would do.

930
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,279
Hound.

931
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,720
Jesus.

932
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,120
Project HOUND.
A new deliriant drug which

933
01:14:50,121 --> 01:14:53,279
rendered its users
incredibly suggestible.

934
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,580
They wanted to use it
as an anti-personnel

935
01:14:55,581 --> 01:14:57,879
weapon, to totally
disorientate the enemy

936
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:00,000
using fear and stimulus.

937
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:02,119
But they shut it down and
hid it away in 1986.

938
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,140
Because of what it did to the
subjects they tested it on.

939
01:15:04,141 --> 01:15:06,159
And what they did to others.

940
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,640
Prolonged exposure
drove them insane.

941
01:15:08,641 --> 01:15:11,119
Made them almost
uncontrollably aggressive.

942
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,799
So, someone's been doing it again?
Carrying on the experiments?

943
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,359
Attempting to refine it, perhaps.
For the last 20 years. Who?

944
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,839
Those names mean anything to you?

945
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,799
No, not a thing.

946
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,839
Five principal scientists.

947
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,600
20 years ago.

948
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,079
Maybe our friend's somewhere
in the back of the picture?

949
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:37,400
Someone old enough to be there at
the time of the experiments in 1986?

950
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,480
Maybe somebody who says
"cell phone" because of

951
01:15:41,481 --> 01:15:44,439
time spent in America?
You remember, John? -mm.

952
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,319
Here's my, cell number.

953
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,679
He gave us his number,
in case we needed him.

954
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,679
My god, Bob Frankland.

955
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,460
But Bob doesn't work on...
He's a virologist.

956
01:15:52,461 --> 01:15:54,239
This is chemical warfare.

957
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:57,479
That's where he started, though.

958
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,180
He's never lost the
certainty, the obsession

959
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:02,879
that that drug
really could work.

960
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,400
Nice of him to give us his number.
Let's arrange a little meeting.

961
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,319
Hello?

962
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,999
Who's this? You've got to find Henry.

963
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,919
It's Louise Mortimer.

964
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,359
Louise, what's wrong?

965
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,640
Henry was, was remembering. Then...

966
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,559
He tried...

967
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:38,039
He's got a gun, he went
for the gun and tried to... What?

968
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:43,519
He's gone. But you've got to stop
him, I don't know what he might do.

969
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,559
Where, where are you?

970
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,559
His house. I'm OK. I'm OK.

971
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,479
Right, stay there.
We'll get someone to you, OK?

972
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,399
Henry? He's attacked her. Gone?

973
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,079
There's only one place he'll go,
back to where it started.

974
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:00,040
Lestrade? Get to the Hollow. Dewer's
Hollow, now! And bring a gun.

975
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,440
I'm sorry.

976
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,840
I'm so sorry, Dad.

977
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,599
No, Henry, no, no! Get back!

978
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,879
Get away from me!
Easy, Henry, easy. Just relax.

979
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,599
I know what I am,
I know what I tried to do.

980
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,159
Just put the gun down, it's OK.
No, no! I know what I am!

981
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,759
Yes, I'm sure you do, Henry.

982
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:11,999
It's all been explained to you,
hasn't it?

983
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,919
Explained very carefully. What?

984
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:17,559
Someone needed to keep you quiet,

985
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,999
needed to keep you as a child, to
reassert the dream you both clung on to,

986
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,839
because you had started to remember.

987
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,780
Remember now, Henry,
you've got to remember

988
01:18:26,781 --> 01:18:29,719
what happened here when
you were a little boy.

989
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:33,599
I thought it had got my dad.

990
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,319
The hound. I thought... Jesus!

991
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,399
I don't... I don't know any more!
I don't!

992
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,540
No, Henry!
Henry, for God's sake!

993
01:18:41,541 --> 01:18:43,679
Henry, remember.
"Liberty In." Two words.

994
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,000
Two words a frightened little
boy saw here 20 years ago.

995
01:18:46,001 --> 01:18:48,319
You'd started to piece
things together.

996
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,999
Remember what happened here
that night.

997
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,439
It wasn't an animal, was it, Henry?

998
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,600
Not a monster.

999
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,400
A man.

1000
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:45,079
You couldn't cope.
You were just a child.

1001
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:48,119
So you rationalised it
into something very different.

1002
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:51,159
Then you started to remember,
so you had to be stopped.

1003
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:55,199
Driven out of your mind so that no-one
would believe a word that you said.

1004
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,639
Sherlock!

1005
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,399
It's OK.

1006
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,519
It's OK, mate.

1007
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:04,719
But we saw it, the hound,
last night. We did, we s...

1008
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:07,359
No, but there was a dog, Henry,

1009
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:11,479
leaving footprints, scaring witnesses,
but nothing more than an ordinary dog.

1010
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:15,239
We both saw it, saw it as our
drugged minds wanted us to see it.

1011
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,640
Fear and stimulus,
that's how it works.

1012
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,559
But there never was any monster.

1013
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,039
Sherlock?

1014
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:31,679
No! No, no, no, no!
Henry, Henry... Sherlock!

1015
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,399
No, no! No, no, no, noooo!

1016
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,920
Henry.

1017
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,719
Sherlock, are you seeing this?

1018
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,620
Right, he is not drugged,
Sherlock, so what's that?

1019
01:20:43,621 --> 01:20:45,519
No! What is it?!

1020
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,119
All right, it's still here.

1021
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:52,359
But it's just a dog, Henry. It's
nothing more than an ordinary dog.

1022
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,439
My god!

1023
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,600
Christ!

1024
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,280
No. No!

1025
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,759
It's not you, not you!

1026
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,960
.. Urgh...

1027
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,559
The fog. What? It's the fog,
the drug, it's in the fog!

1028
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,620
Aerosol dispersant, that's
what it said in the records.

1029
01:21:37,621 --> 01:21:39,679
Project HOUND, it's the fog!

1030
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,479
A chemical minefield.

1031
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:45,879
For God's sake, kill it! Kill it!

1032
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,919
Look at it, Henry.

1033
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:03,160
No, no, no. Come on, look at it!

1034
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,519
You bastard.

1035
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:14,119
You... bastard!

1036
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,040
20 years! 20 years of my
life, making no sense!

1037
01:22:16,041 --> 01:22:17,959
It's all over now, come on.

1038
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,919
Why didn't you just kill me?

1039
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:23,519
Because dead men get listened to,
he needed to do more than kill you.

1040
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,839
He had to discredit every word
you ever said about your father.

1041
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,399
And he had the means
right at his feet.

1042
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:33,239
A chemical minefield,
pressure pads in the ground,

1043
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,759
dosing you up every time
that you came back here.

1044
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,279
Murder weapon
and scene of the crime all at once.

1045
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:42,359
This case, Henry.
Thank you.

1046
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,440
It's been brilliant! Sherlock. What?

1047
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,000
Timing.

1048
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,639
Not good? No, no, it's OK.

1049
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:56,519
It's fine. Because this means...

1050
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,199
this means that my dad was right.

1051
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,679
He'd found something out, hadn't he?

1052
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:06,959
And that's why you killed him,
because he was right,

1053
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:13,119
and he'd found you right
in the middle of an experiment!

1054
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,720
Frankland!

1055
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,760
Frankland! Keep running.

1056
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,039
Come on, keep up!

1057
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,040
It's no use, Frankland.

1058
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,640
Thanks, Bill.

1059
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:45,039
So they didn't have it put down
then, the dog? Obviously.

1060
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:48,079
I suppose they just couldn't
bring themselves to do it.

1061
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,480
I see.

1062
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,000
No, you don't.

1063
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,880
No, I don't. Sentiment? Sentiment.

1064
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:00,360
Listen, what happened to me
in the lab?

1065
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,639
Do you want some sauce with that?

1066
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,860
I hadn't been to the Hollow.
How come I heard

1067
01:25:05,861 --> 01:25:08,079
those things there?
Fear and stimulus, you said?

1068
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:11,159
You must have been dosed with it
elsewhere. In the lab, maybe?

1069
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,999
You saw those pipes,
pretty ancient, leaky as a sieve.

1070
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,559
And they were carrying the gas, so...
Ketchup was it, or brown? Hang on.

1071
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,999
You thought it was in the sugar. You
were convinced it was in the sugar.

1072
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I'd better get going,
there's a train

1073
01:25:24,001 --> 01:25:25,999
leaving in half an hour,
so if you want...

1074
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,839
God! It was you.

1075
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:31,319
You locked me in that bloody lab.

1076
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:34,839
I had to, it was an experiment.
An experiment?! Ssh.

1077
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:37,320
I was terrified, scared to death!
I thought the drug

1078
01:25:37,321 --> 01:25:39,799
was in the sugar, so I
put some in your coffee.

1079
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,480
Then I arranged everything
with Major Barrymore.

1080
01:25:42,481 --> 01:25:45,160
Totally scientific, laboratory
conditions, literally.

1081
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:54,439
(It's in here with me.) All right,
keep talking, I'll find you.

1082
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:58,399
Keep talking. (I can't, it'll hear
me.) Tell me what you're seeing.

1083
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:04,279
I don't know, but I can hear it now.

1084
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:07,020
I knew what effect it
had had on a superior

1085
01:26:07,021 --> 01:26:09,759
mind, so I needed to try
it on an average one.

1086
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,359
You know what I mean.

1087
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:16,159
But it wasn't in the sugar. No, well,

1088
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,560
I wasn't to know you'd already
been exposed to the gas.

1089
01:26:18,561 --> 01:26:20,959
So you got it wrong. No.

1090
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,200
You were wrong. It wasn't in
the sugar, you got it wrong. A bit.

1091
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:28,440
It won't happen again.

1092
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,079
Any long-term effects?

1093
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:37,160
None at all. You'll be fine once
you've excreted it. We all will.

1094
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:41,280
I think I might have taken care
of that already.

1095
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,080
Where are you going?
I won't be a minute.

1096
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,640
Got to see a man about a dog.

1097
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:12,400
All right, let him go.

1098
