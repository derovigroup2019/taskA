1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,040
Why today?

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,599
Do you want to hear me say it?
18 months since our last appointment.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,880
You read the papers?

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,920
Sometimes... And you watch telly?

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,640
You know why I'm here.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,920
I'm here because...

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,400
What happened, John?

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,080
Sherl...

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,840
You need to get it out.

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,760
My best friend... Sherlock Holmes...

11
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,520
..is dead.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Sherlock 2x03
"The Reichenbach Fall"

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd

14
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,079
Falls Of The Reichenbach.
Turner's masterpiece.

15
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,839
Thankfully recovered,

16
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,800
owing to the prodigious talent
of Mr Sherlock Holmes.

17
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,240
A small token of our gratitude.

18
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,639
Diamond cufflinks...
All my cuffs have buttons.

19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,960
He means thank you. Do I?

20
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:01,799
Just say it. Thank you.

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,240
Hang on.

22
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,599
Back together with my family,
after my terrifying ordeal.

23
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,879
And we have one person to thank
for my deliverance...

24
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,040
Sherlock Holmes.

25
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,280
Tie pin. I don't wear ties. Shhh.

26
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,399
Peter Ricoletti... Number one on
Interpol's most wanted list since 1982.

27
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,580
We got him, and there's one person we have

28
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:38,759
to thank for giving us the decisive leads.

29
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,399
With all his customary diplomacy and tact.

30
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,000
Sarcasm. Yes.

31
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,560
We all chipped in.

32
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,519
Oh... Put the hat on. Put the hat on.

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,799
Yes, Sherlock, put it on.

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,160
Just get it over with.

35
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,999
"Boffin!"

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,559
"Boffin Sherlock Holmes!"

37
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,838
Everybody gets one.

38
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,320
One what? Tabloid nickname.

39
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:20,740
SuBo, Nasty Nick.
I'll probably get one soon.

40
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:23,159
Page five, column six, first sentence.

41
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,199
Why is it always the hat photograph?!

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,040
"Bachelor John Watson.
" What kind of hat is it?

43
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,879
What are they implying?!

44
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,879
Is it a cap? Why has it
got two fronts? It's a deerstalker.

45
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,200
"Frequently seen in the company
of bachelor John Watson.

46
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:37,519
" What are you going to do, throw it?

47
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,199
"Confirmed bachelor John Watson."
A death frisbee! This is too much,

48
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,580
we need to be more careful. It's got flaps.

49
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:45,959
Ear flaps, it's an ear hat, John.

50
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,759
What do you mean, more careful?

51
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,999
I mean, this isn't a deerstalker
now, it's a Sherlock Holmes hat.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,839
I mean, you're not exactly
a private detective any more.

53
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,039
You're this far from famous.
Oh, it'll pass.

54
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,740
It better pass.
The press will turn, Sherlock,

55
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:03,439
they always turn and they'll turn on you.

56
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,239
It really bothers you.
What? What people say. Yes.

57
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,360
About me? why would it upset YOU?

58
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,640
Just try to keep a low profile. Find
yourself a little case this week.

59
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,880
Stay out of the news.

60
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,959
That's your phone.

61
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,200
Hmm, it keeps doing that.

62
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,679
So, did you just talk to him
for a really long time?

63
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,799
Oh, Henry Fishguard
never committed suicide.

64
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,279
Bow Street runners missed everything.

65
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,799
Pressing case, is it? They're all
pressing until they're solved.

66
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Put your key back please.
Thank you.

67
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,279
Excuse me, sir.

68
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,040
Any metal objects, keys, mobile phones?

69
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,879
You can go through.

70
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,080
Thank you.

71
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,520
Fancy a cuppa then, mate?

72
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah, why not?

73
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,039
Gilts at seven.

74
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,960
Dutch Telecoms in free-fall.
Thank you, Harvey.

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,120
What are you saying?

76
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:27,999
Refuse them all parole
and bring back the rope?

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,600
Let's begin.

78
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,839
This is an emergency. Please leave.

79
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,400
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

80
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,199
Sir, there's been a break-in.

81
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,240
Not our division.

82
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:11,680
You'll want it.

83
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,440
The vault!

84
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,159
Hacked into the Tower of bloody
London's security?! How?!

85
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,980
Tell them we're on our way!

86
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:38,799
There's been another one, another break-in.

87
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,280
Bank of England!

88
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,320
Sir! Security's down, sir.
It's failing.

89
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,840
What is it now?

90
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:07,599
Pentonville Prison.

91
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,320
Oh no!

92
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,320
No rush.

93
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,720
I'll get it, shall I?

94
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,879
Here. Not now, I'm busy.

95
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,720
Sherlock... Not now! He's back.

96
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,679
That glass is tougher than anything.

97
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,480
Not tougher than crystallised
carbon. He used a diamond.

98
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,199
# Oh, sinnerman, where you gonna run to?

99
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,160
# Sinnerman, where you gonna run to?

100
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,159
# Where you gonna run to?

101
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,439
# All on that day

102
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,519
# Well, I run to the rock... #

103
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,520
Ready? Yes.

104
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,199
Stand back. Stand back.
Mr Holmes. Mr Holmes.

105
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,560
Let them through.
Thank you. Get in.

106
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,760
# Oh, Lord... # Please help me, Lord

107
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,400
# Don't you see me praying

108
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,959
# Don't you see me down here praying

109
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,039
# But the Lord said

110
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,759
# Go to the devil The Lord said

111
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,240
# Go to the devil

112
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,079
# He said Go to the devil

113
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,599
# All on that day

114
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,999
# So I ran to the devil

115
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,919
# He was waiting... #

116
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,480
Remember... Yes.

117
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,360
Remember... Yes.

118
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,119
Remember what they told you.
Don't try to be clever. No.

119
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,580
Please, keep it simple and brief.
God forbid the

120
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:38,039
star witness at the trial
should appear intelligent.

121
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,439
Intelligent, fine. Let's give
"smart-arse" a wide berth.

122
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,640
I'll just be myself.
Are you listening to me?

123
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,759
Today, outside the Old Bailey...

124
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,159
This is the trial of the century...
The trial of James Moriarty...

125
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,519
James Moriarty, earlier today accused of...

126
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,519
..attempting to steal
the Crown Jewels.

127
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,760
At the Old Bailey we have
Reichenbach hero Sherlock Holmes...

128
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,040
Would you mind slipping your hand
into my pocket?

129
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,279
Thanks.

130
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,319
# It was boiling, I ran to the sea

131
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,679
# It was boiling
I ran to the sea... #

132
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,240
Crown v Moriarty,
please proceed to Court 10.

133
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,920
You're him.

134
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,559
Wrong toilet. I'm a big fan.
Evidently.

135
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,679
I read your cases, follow them all.

136
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,600
Sign my shirt, would you?

137
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,400
There are two types of fans. Oh?

138
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,359
Catch me before I kill again,
Type A. Uh-huh.

139
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,919
What's Type B? Your bedroom's
just a taxi ride away. Hmm.

140
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,280
Guess which one I am?

141
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,279
Neither. Really?
No, you're not a fan at all.

142
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,599
Those marks on your forearm,
edge of a desk.

143
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,479
You've been typing in a hurry, probably,
pressure on, facing a deadline.

144
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,999
That all?

145
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,239
There's an ink smudge on your wrist,
a bulge in your jacket pocket.

146
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,380
Bit of a giveaway? The smudge is deliberate,

147
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:38,519
to see if I'm as good as they say I am.

148
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,799
Hmm. Oil-based,
used in newspaper print.

149
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,719
But drawn on with an index finger,
your finger. Hmm.

150
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,640
Journalist. Unlikely you
get your hands dirty at the press.

151
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,079
You put that there to test me.
Wow! I'm liking you.

152
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,599
I'd make a great feature, "Sherlock
Holmes, the man beneath the hat".

153
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,719
Kitty... Riley. Pleased to meet you.

154
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,160
I'm saving you the job of asking.

155
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:06,599
I won't give you an interview.
No, I don't want the money.

156
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,800
You and John Watson, just platonic?

157
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:10,999
Can I put you down for
a "no" there as well

158
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,319
There's all sorts of gossip
in the press about you.

159
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,159
Sooner or later, you're going
to need someone on your side.

160
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,440
Someone to set the record straight.

161
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,399
You think you're
the girl for that job, do you?

162
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm smart and you can trust me...

163
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,959
..totally.

164
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,679
Smart? OK, investigative
journalist.

165
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,800
Good. Well, look at me
and tell me what you see.

166
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,279
If you're that skilful,
you don't need an interview,

167
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,440
you can just read what you need.

168
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,879
No? OK, my turn.

169
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,040
I see someone who's waiting for their first

170
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,199
scoop, so their editor will notice them.

171
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,860
You're wearing an expensive
skirt, that's been

172
00:14:58,861 --> 00:15:01,519
rehemmed twice. Only posh skirt you've got.

173
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,440
Your nails, you can't afford
to do them that often.

174
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:05,359
I see someone who's hungry,

175
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,820
I don't see smart. I don't see trustworthy.

176
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:10,280
I'll give you a quote.
if you like. Three little words.

177
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,360
You repel me.

178
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,519
"A consulting criminal." Yes.

179
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,960
Your words.
Can you expand on that answer?

180
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,439
James Moriarty is for hire.
A tradesman?

181
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,639
Yes. But not the sort
who'd fix your heating?

182
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,679
No, the sort who'd plant a bomb
or stage an assassination.

183
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,239
But I'm sure he'd make a decent job
of your boiler.

184
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,799
Would you describe him as...

185
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,279
Leading. What?
You're leading the witness.

186
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,759
He'll object and the judge'll
uphold. Mr Holmes.

187
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,560
Ask me how, HOW would I describe him?

188
00:15:56,561 --> 00:16:00,319
What opinion have I formed of him?
Do they not teach you this?

189
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,519
Mr Holmes, we are fine without your help.

190
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,479
HOW would you describe this man,
his character?

191
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,959
First mistake.

192
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,799
James Moriarty isn't a man at all.

193
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,480
He's a spider.

194
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,439
A spider at the centre of a web, a
criminal web with a thousand threads

195
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,440
and he knows precisely how each
and every single one of them dances.

196
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,359
And how long...?
No, no. Don't, don't do that.

197
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,079
That's really not a good question.
Mr Holmes!

198
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,879
How long have I known him?
Not your best line of enquiry.

199
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,119
We met twice, five minutes in total.

200
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,439
I pulled a gun, he tried to blow me up.

201
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,599
I felt we had a special something.

202
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,039
Miss Sorrel, are you seriously
claiming this man is an expert?

203
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,079
After knowing the accused
for just five minutes?

204
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,119
Two minutes would have made me
an expert, five was ample.

205
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,280
Mr Holmes, that's a matter
for the jury. Oh, really?

206
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,439
One librarian, two teachers,

207
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,719
two high-pressure jobs,
probably the City.

208
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,060
The foreman's a medical secretary, trained

209
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:05,399
abroad, judging by her shorthand. Mr Holmes?

210
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,519
Seven are married, two are having
an affair with each other.

211
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,740
Oh, they've just had tea and biscuits.

212
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:12,959
Would you like to know who ate the wafer?
Mr Holmes!

213
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,719
You've been called here
to answer Miss Sorrel's questions,

214
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,359
not to give us a display
of your intellectual prowess.

215
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,079
Keep your answers brief and to the point.

216
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,239
Anything else will be treated as contempt.

217
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,320
Do you think you could survive
for just a few minutes...

218
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,399
What did I say?
I said don't get clever.

219
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,479
I can't just turn it on and off
like a tap. Well? Well, what?

220
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,999
You were there for the whole thing,
up in the gallery, start to finish.

221
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,599
Like you said it would be - sat
on his backside, never even stirred.

222
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,759
Moriarty is not mounting any defence.

223
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,679
Bank of England, Tower of London,
Pentonville.

224
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,279
Three of the most secure places
in the country

225
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,359
and six weeks ago, Moriarty breaks in,

226
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,079
no-one knows how or why.

227
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,880
All we know is...
He ended up in custody.

228
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,959
Don't do that. Do what?

229
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,140
The look. Look? You're doing the look again.

230
00:18:26,141 --> 00:18:28,319
Well, I can't see it, can I?

231
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,799
It's my face.

232
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,399
Yes and you're doing a "We both know
what's really going on here" face.

233
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,479
We do. No, I don't, which is why
I find the face so annoying.

234
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,839
If Moriarty wanted the jewels,
he'd have them.

235
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,759
If he wanted the prisoners freed,
they'd be on the streets.

236
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,399
The reason he's still in a prison
cell is cos he chose to be there.

237
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,200
Somehow this is part of his scheme.

238
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,680
Mr Crayhill,
can we have your first witness?

239
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,079
Your Honour,
we're not calling any witnesses.

240
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,599
I don't follow.

241
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,079
You've entered a plea of not guilty.

242
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,959
Nevertheless,
my client is offering no evidence.

243
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,720
The defence...rests.

244
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,599
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
James Moriarty stands accused...

245
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,080
of several counts of attempted burglary.

246
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,759
Crimes which, if he's found guilty,

247
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,679
will elicit a very long custodial sentence,

248
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,399
and yet...his legal team...

249
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,159
has chosen to offer no evidence whatsoever

250
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,239
to support their plea.

251
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,839
I find myself in the unusual position

252
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,959
of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly.

253
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,880
You must find him guilty.

254
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,359
Guilty.

255
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,280
You must find him guilty.

256
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,399
They're coming back.
That's six minutes.

257
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,359
Surprised it took them
that long, to be honest.

258
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,440
There's a queue for the loo!

259
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,320
Have you reached a verdict
on which you all agree?

260
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,279
Not guilty, they found him not guilty.

261
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,280
No defence and Moriarty's walked free.

262
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,599
Sherlock?

263
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,240
Are you listening? He's out, you know
he'll be coming after you. Sherl...

264
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,880
Most people knock.

265
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,800
But then, you're not most people,
I suppose.

266
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,960
Kettle's just boiled.

267
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,640
Johann Sebastian would be appalled.

268
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,800
May I? Please.

269
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,399
You know when he was on his deathbed, Bach,

270
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,279
he heard his son at the piano
playing one of his...pieces.

271
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,159
The boy stopped before he got to the end.

272
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,319
The dying man jumped out of bed,
ran to the piano and finished it.

273
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,480
Couldn't cope with an unfinished melody.

274
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:28,639
Neither can you, that's why you've come.

275
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,719
Be honest, you're a tiny bit
pleased. What, with the verdict?

276
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,960
With me, back on the streets.

277
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,960
Every fairy tale needs
a good old-fashioned villain.

278
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,120
You need me or you're nothing.

279
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,959
Because we're just alike, you and I,

280
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,480
except you're boring.

281
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,839
You're on the side of the angels.

282
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,680
You got to the jury, of course.

283
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,919
I got into the Tower of London,

284
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,320
you think I can't worm my way
into 12 hotel rooms?

285
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,519
Cable network.

286
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,760
Every hotel bedroom
has a personalised TV screen.

287
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,959
And every person has their pressure point.

288
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,240
Someone that they want
to protect from harm.

289
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,559
Easy peasy.

290
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,560
So how are you going to do it?

291
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,759
Burn me?

292
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,040
Ah, that's the problem, the final problem.

293
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,520
Have you worked out what it is yet?

294
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,439
What's the final problem?

295
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,200
I did tell you...
but did you listen?

296
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,000
How hard do you find it,
having to say "I don't know"?

297
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,279
I don't know. Oh, that's clever,
very clever, awfully clever.

298
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,959
Speaking of clever, have you
told your little friends yet?

299
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,200
Told them what?

300
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:05,239
Why I broke into all those places
and never took anything? No.

301
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,279
But you understand? Obviously.
Off you go, then.

302
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,519
Tell you what you already know?
No, prove that you know it.

303
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,799
You didn't take anything
because you don't need to. Good.

304
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,279
You'll never need to take anything
ever again. Very good, because?

305
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,559
Because nothing in the Bank of England,

306
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,959
the Tower of London or Pentonville
Prison could possibly match

307
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,639
the value of the key
that could get you into all three.

308
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,679
I can open any door anywhere with
a few tiny lines of computer code.

309
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,999
No such thing as a private bank
account now, they're all mine.

310
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,160
No such thing as secrecy, I OWN secrecy.

311
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,319
Nuclear codes?

312
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,839
I could blow up NATO in alphabetical order.

313
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,959
In a world of locked rooms,
the man with the key is king.

314
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,040
And honey, you should see me in a crown.

315
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,359
You were advertising all through the trial,

316
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,559
you were showing the world what you can do.

317
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,039
And you were helping.

318
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,839
Big client list - rogue governments,
intelligence communities,

319
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,480
terrorist cells.

320
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,439
They all want me.

321
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,639
Suddenly, I'm Mr Sex.

322
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,439
If you can break any bank, what do
you care about the highest bidder?

323
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,279
I don't, I just like to watch them
all competing.

324
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,079
"Daddy loves me the best."
Aren't ordinary people adorable?

325
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,559
Well, you know, you've got John.
I should get myself a live-in one.

326
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,279
Why are you doing all of this?
It must be so funny.

327
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,719
You don't want money or power, not really.

328
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,119
What is it all for?

329
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,840
I want to solve the problem.

330
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,559
Our problem.

331
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,040
The final problem.

332
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,280
It's going to start
very soon, Sherlock...the fall.

333
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,719
But don't be scared,
falling is just like flying,

334
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,440
except there's a more
permanent destination.

335
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,640
Never liked riddles.

336
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,600
Learn to.

337
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,160
Because I owe you a fall, Sherlock.

338
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,520
I...owe...you.

339
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,720
Er, excuse me,
I'm looking for Mycroft Holmes?

340
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,959
Would you happen to know
if he's around at all?

341
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,399
Can you not hear me?

342
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,199
Yes, all right. Anyone?

343
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,519
Anyone at all know...

344
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,039
where Mycroft Holmes is,
I've been asked to meet him here?

345
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,999
No takers, right. Am I invisible,
can you actually see me?

346
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,560
Ah, thanks, gents. I've been asked to
meet Mycroft Holmes. What the hell?!

347
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,439
Tradition, John, our traditions define us.

348
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,599
So total silence is traditional, is it?

349
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,439
You can't even say pass the sugar?

350
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,599
Three-quarters
of the diplomatic service

351
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,919
and half the government front bench
all sharing one tea trolley,

352
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,599
it's for the best, believe me.

353
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,039
We don't want a repeat of...1972.

354
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,839
But we can talk in here.
You read this stuff?

355
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,279
Caught my eye. Mm-hm.

356
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,599
Saturday, they're doing a big expose.

357
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,399
I'd love to know
where she got her information.

358
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,359
Someone called Brook.
Recognise the name?

359
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,239
School friend, maybe?

360
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,840
Of Sherlock's?

361
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,280
But that's not why I asked you here.

362
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,759
Who's that? Don't know? No.
Never seen his face before?

363
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,159
Um... He's taken a flat in Baker
Street, two doors down from you.

364
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,319
Hm, I was thinking of doing
a drinks thing for the neighbours.

365
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,879
I'm not sure you'll want to.

366
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,639
Sulejmani, Albanian hit squad,
expertly trained killer,

367
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,239
living less than 20 feet
from your front door.

368
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,359
Well, it's a great location.
Jubilee line's handy.

369
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,679
John... What's it got to do with me?

370
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,719
Dyachenko. Ludmila.

371
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,120
Oh...

372
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,079
Actually, I think I have seen her.
Russian killer.

373
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,359
She's taken the flat opposite.

374
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,560
OK.

375
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,799
I'm sensing a pattern here.

376
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,559
In fact, four top
international assassins relocate

377
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,440
to within spitting distance of 221b.

378
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,639
Anything you'd care to share with me?

379
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,319
I'm moving? It's not hard to guess
the common denominator, is it?

380
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,039
You think this is Moriarty?

381
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,639
He promised Sherlock he'd come back.

382
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,120
If this was Moriarty, we'd be dead
already. If not Moriarty, then who?

383
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,839
Why don't you talk to Sherlock,
if you're so concerned about him?

384
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,479
Oh, God, don't tell me.

385
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,359
Too much history between us, John.

386
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,559
Old scores, resentments.

387
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,120
Nicked all his Smurfs?
Broke his Action Man?

388
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,880
Finished.

389
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,279
We both know what's coming, John.

390
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,559
Moriarty is obsessed, he's sworn
to destroy his only rival.

391
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,500
So you want me to watch out for your

392
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,439
brother because he won't accept your help?

393
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,600
If it's not too much trouble?

394
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,720
Excuse me. Sorry.

395
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,399
Sherlock, something weird... What's
going on? Kidnapping. Rufus Bruhl.

396
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,919
The ambassador to the US.
He's in Washington, isn't he?

397
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,999
Not him, his children. Max
and Claudette, age seven and nine.

398
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,839
They're at St Aldates.
Posh boarding place in Surrey.

399
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,879
School broke up, the boarders went home.

400
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,840
A few kids remained, including those two.

401
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:54,799
The kids have vanished.

402
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,440
The ambassador's asked for you
personally. The Reichenbach hero.

403
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,920
Isn't it great
to be working with a celebrity?

404
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,399
We shouldn't need to keep you
for much longer. Thank you.

405
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,879
It's all right. Miss Mackenzie,
House Mistress. Go easy.

406
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,519
Miss Mackenzie,
you're in charge of pupil welfare,

407
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,839
yet you left this place
wide open last night.

408
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,999
What are you, an idiot, a drunk or
a criminal?! Quickly, tell me!

409
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,719
All the doors and windows
were properly bolted.

410
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,359
No-one, not even me,
went into their room last night.

411
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,479
You have to believe me! I do,
I just wanted you to speak quickly.

412
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,960
Miss Mackenzie will need
to breath into a bag now.

413
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,199
Six grand a term, you'd expect them
to keep the kids safe for you.

414
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,959
You said the other kids
had all left on their holidays.

415
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,399
They were the only two
sleeping on this floor.

416
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,639
There's absolutely
no sign of a break-in.

417
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,160
The intruder must have been
hidden inside some place.

418
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,760
Show me where the brother slept.

419
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,480
The boy sleeps there every night.

420
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,319
Gazing at the only light source
outside in the corridor.

421
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,799
He'd recognise every shape, every outline,

422
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,199
the silhouette of everyone
who came to the door.

423
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,199
OK, so? So if someone approaches
the door who he doesn't recognise,

424
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,080
an intruder, maybe he can even see
the outline of a weapon.

425
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,319
What would he do?

426
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,239
In the precious few seconds
before they came into the room,

427
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,719
how would he use them if not to cry out?

428
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,599
This little boy,
this particular little boy,

429
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,079
who reads all of those spy books,
what would he do?

430
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,240
He'd leave a sign?

431
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,120
Get Anderson!

432
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,720
Linseed oil.

433
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,599
Not much use, it doesn't lead us to
the kidnapper. Brilliant, Anderson.

434
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,400
Really? Yes, brilliant
impression of an idiot.

435
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,840
Floor.

436
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,759
He...made a trail for us. The boy
was made to walk ahead of them.

437
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,559
On what, tiptoe? Indicates anxiety.

438
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,000
Gun held to his head.

439
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,479
The girl was pulled beside him,
dragged sideways.

440
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,080
He had his left arm cradled about her neck.

441
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,519
That's the end of it, we don't know
where they went from here.

442
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,719
Tells us nothing after all.

443
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,240
You're right, Anderson, nothing.

444
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,960
Except his shoe size, his height,
his gait, his walking pace.

445
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,960
Having fun? Starting to.

446
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,920
Maybe don't do the smiling.
Kidnapped children?

447
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,759
How could he get past the CCTV?
If all the doors were locked.

448
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,839
He walked in when they weren't locked.

449
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,719
But a stranger can't just
walk into a school like that.

450
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,279
Anyone can walk in anywhere
if they pick the right moment.

451
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,759
Yesterday, end of term, parents
milling around, chauffeurs, staff.

452
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,800
What's one more stranger among that lot?

453
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,920
He was waiting for them.

454
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,120
All he had to do was find a place to hide.

455
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,239
Molly!

456
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,399
Hello, I'm just going out. No,
you're not. I've got a lunch date.

457
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,039
Cancel it, have lunch with me.
What? I need your help.

458
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,679
One of your old boyfriends,
we're tracking him down.

459
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,479
He's been naughty. Moriarty?
Of course it's Moriarty!

460
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,479
Jim wasn't my boyfriend,
we went out three times. I ended it.

461
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,960
Then he stole the Crown
Jewels, broke into the

462
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:22,439
Bank of England and
organised a prison break.

463
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,820
For the sake of law and
order, I suggest you avoid

464
00:36:24,821 --> 00:36:27,200
all future attempts at
a relationship, Molly.

465
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,239
Oil, John. The oil
in the kidnapper's footprint.

466
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,119
It'll lead us to Moriarty.

467
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,839
All the chemical traces on his shoe
have been preserved.

468
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,240
The sole of the shoe is like a passport.

469
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,640
If we're lucky, we'll see
everything he's been up to.

470
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,960
I need that analysis.

471
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,799
Alkaline.

472
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Thank you, John. Molly. Yes.

473
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,680
I...O...U.

474
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,680
Glycerol molecule.

475
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,920
What are you?

476
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,080
What did you mean, IOU?

477
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,280
You said IOU.

478
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,720
You were muttering it while you were
working. Nothing, mental note.

479
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,279
You're a bit like my dad. He's dead.
No, sorry.

480
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,340
Molly, please don't feel the need to make

481
00:37:51,341 --> 00:37:53,399
conversation, it's really not your area.

482
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,239
When he was dying, he was
always cheerful, he was lovely,

483
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,200
except when he thought
no-one could see.

484
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,040
I saw him once, he looked sad.
Molly.

485
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,160
You look sad,
when you think he can't see you.

486
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,119
Are you OK? And don't just say you
are, because I know what that means,

487
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,600
looking sad when you think
no-one can see you.

488
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,680
You can see me. I don't count.

489
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,359
What I'm trying to say is,
that if there's anything I can do,

490
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,159
anything you need, anything at all,
you can have me.

491
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:37,800
No, I just mean, I mean, if there's
anything you need, it's fine.

492
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,840
But what can I need from you?

493
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,439
Nothing. I don't know.

494
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,600
You could probably say thank you, actually.

495
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,559
Thank you?

496
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,639
I'm just going to go and get
some crisps. Do you want anything?

497
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,319
It's OK, I know you don't.

498
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,400
Well, actually, maybe I'll...
I know you don't.

499
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,079
Sherlock? Hmm?

500
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:18,679
This envelope that was in her trunk,
there's another one. What?

501
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:23,720
On our doorstep. Found it today.
Yes, and look at that.

502
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,000
Look at that, exactly the same seal.

503
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,759
Breadcrumbs. Uh-huh.
It was there when I got back.

504
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,999
A little trace of breadcrumbs.

505
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,200
Hardback copy of Fairy Tales.

506
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,620
Two children led into the forest by a wicked

507
00:39:44,621 --> 00:39:46,959
father, follow a little
trail of breadcrumbs.

508
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,959
That's Hansel and Gretel.
What sort of kidnapper leaves clues?

509
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,599
The sort that likes to boast,
that thinks it's a game.

510
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,839
He sat in our flat and he said
these exact words to me...

511
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,600
"All fairy tales need
a good old-fashioned villain."

512
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,640
The fifth substance, it's part of
the tale. The witch's house. What?

513
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,800
The glycerol molecule.

514
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,720
PGPR! What's that?
It's used in making chocolate.

515
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,680
This fax arrived an hour ago.

516
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,280
What have you got for us?

517
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:32,140
We need to find a place in the city where

518
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:33,999
all five of these things intersect.

519
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,239
Chalk, asphalt, brick dust, vegetation.

520
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,119
What - chocolate?! I think we're
looking for a disused sweet factory.

521
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,559
We need to narrow that down.
A sweet factory with asphalt?

522
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,719
No, too general.
Something more specific.

523
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,680
Chalk, chalky clay. That's a far
thinner band of geology.

524
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,640
Brick dust?

525
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,039
Building site.
Bricks from the 1950s.

526
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,599
There's thousands of building sites
in London.

527
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,999
I've got people out looking.
So have I!

528
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,439
Homeless network, faster than the police,

529
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,120
far more relaxed about taking bribes.

530
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,919
John.

531
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,480
Rhododendron ponticum. Matches.

532
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,680
Addlestone. What?

533
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:34,959
A mile of disused factories between the
river and the park, matches everything.

534
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,400
Right, come on. Come on!

535
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,919
OK, you look over there.

536
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,000
Look everywhere.

537
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:54,480
OK, spread out, please, spread out.

538
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,520
Quietly, quietly!

539
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,799
This was alight moments ago.
They're still here! Sweet wrappers?

540
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,560
What's he been feeding you?
Hansel and Gretel.

541
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,759
Ugh!

542
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,119
Mercury. What?

543
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,759
The papers, they're painted
with mercury, lethal.

544
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,880
The more they ate...

545
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:29,559
It was killing them. But it's not
enough to kill them on its own.

546
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,199
Taken in large enough quantities,
eventually it would kill them.

547
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,159
He didn't need to be there
for the execution.

548
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,000
Murder by remote control,
he could be 1,000 miles away.

549
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,359
The hungrier they got, the more they
ate, the faster they died. Neat.

550
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,600
Sherlock. Over here!

551
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,880
I've got him, don't worry.

552
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,599
Right then, the professionals are finished.

553
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,000
If the amateurs want to go in
and have their turn.

554
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,119
Now remember, she's in shock
and she's just seven years old,

555
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,199
so, anything you can do to...

556
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,600
Not be myself?
Yeah, might be helpful.

557
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,679
Claudette, I...

558
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,519
No, no, I know it's been hard for you.

559
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,320
Claudette, listen to me.
Out. Get out!

560
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,999
Makes no sense.
Kid's traumatised.

561
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,079
Something about Sherlock reminds her
of the kidnapper. What's she said?

562
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,759
Hasn't uttered another syllable.
And the boy? No, he's unconscious.

563
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,880
He's still in intensive care.

564
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,880
Don't let it get to you,

565
00:44:01,881 --> 00:44:04,599
I always feel like screaming
when you walk into a room.

566
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,240
In fact, so do most people.

567
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,440
Come on.

568
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,239
Brilliant work you did finding
those kids from just a footprint,

569
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,400
it's really amazing.

570
00:44:17,401 --> 00:44:18,559
Thank you.

571
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,920
Unbelievable.

572
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,480
Ah.

573
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,680
You OK? Thinking.

574
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,480
This is my cab, you get the next
one. Why? You might talk.

575
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,199
'Is this chocolate?' 'We're looking
for a disused sweet factory.'

576
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,919
'Get out!'

577
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,480
'Aaaargh!'

578
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,520
Problem?

579
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,959
'..this stunning evening wear set
from us at London Taxi Shopping.

580
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,119
Can you turn this off, please? 'The
set comprises of a beautiful...'

581
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,079
Can you turn this off?!

582
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,320
'Accompanied by four
spangly diamond bracelets...'

583
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,679
Hello.

584
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,639
Are you ready for the story?

585
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,200
This is the story
of Sir Boast-a-lot.

586
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,719
A footprint, it's all he had.

587
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,719
A footprint.

588
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,359
Yeah, well, you know what he's like.
CSI Baker Street.

589
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,519
Well, our boys couldn't have done it.

590
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,799
Well, that's why we need him,
he's better. That's one explanation.

591
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,479
And what's the other?

592
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,679
Sir Boast-a-lot was the bravest and
cleverest knight at the round table.

593
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,519
But soon the other knights began
to grow tired of his stories

594
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,760
about how brave he was
and how many dragons he'd slain.

595
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:12,919
And soon they began to wonder, "Are
Sir Boast-a-lot's stories even true?"

596
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,000
Only he could have found that evidence.

597
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,439
Oh, no.

598
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,380
The girl screams her head off when she sees

599
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:21,319
him - a man she has never seen before,

600
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,999
unless she had seen him before.
What's your point?

601
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,879
You know what it is, you just
don't want to think about it.

602
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,159
So, all of the knights
went to King Arthur and said,

603
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,719
"I don't believe
Sir Boast-a-lot's stories.

604
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:39,880
"He's just a big old liar who makes
things up to make himself look good."

605
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,239
You're not seriously suggesting
he's involved, are you?

606
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,320
We have to entertain the possibility.

607
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,000
And then, even the King began to wonder.

608
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,760
But that wasn't the end
of Sir Boast-a-lot's problem.

609
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,080
No.

610
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,040
That wasn't the final problem.

611
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,560
The end.

612
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,119
Stop the cab.

613
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,719
Stop the cab!

614
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,880
What was that?!

615
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,959
What was that?

616
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,000
No charge.

617
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,840
Watch out!

618
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,040
Thank you.

619
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,240
Sherlock!

620
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,559
That is him. It's him.

621
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,439
Sulejmani or something,
Mycroft showed me his file.

622
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,359
He's a big Albanian gangster,
lives two doors down from us.

623
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,320
He died because I shook his hand.
What?

624
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:10,880
He saved my life,
but he couldn't touch me. Why?

625
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,039
Four assassins
living right on our doorstep.

626
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,959
They haven't come here to kill me.

627
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,559
They have to keep me alive.

628
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,879
I've got something that all of them want.

629
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,640
But if one of them approaches me...

630
00:48:23,641 --> 00:48:25,920
The others kill them
before they can get it.

631
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,720
All of the attention is focused on me.

632
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,359
There's a surveillance web
closing in on us right now.

633
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,640
So what have you got that's so important?

634
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,999
I need to ask about the dusting.

635
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,279
Precise details, in the last week,
what's been cleaned?

636
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,319
Tuesday, I did your lino. No, this
room, this is where we'll find it.

637
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,300
Any break in the dust line.

638
00:48:51,301 --> 00:48:53,279
You can put back anything but dust.
Dust is eloquent.

639
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,760
What's he on about?

640
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,999
Cameras, we're being watched.

641
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,599
What?! Cameras? Here?

642
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,560
I'm in my nightie!

643
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,399
No, Inspector. Why?

644
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,839
The answer's no.
You've not heard the question!

645
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:28,319
You want to take me to the station.
Saving you the trouble of asking.

646
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,079
Sherlock.

647
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,199
The scream? Yeah.

648
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,359
Who was it? Donovan?
I bet it was Donovan.

649
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,759
"Am I somehow responsible
for the kidnapping?"

650
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,359
Ha ha, Moriarty is smart.

651
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:42,279
He planted that doubt in her head.
That little nagging sensation.

652
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,559
You're going to have to be strong
to resist.

653
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,079
You can't kill an idea, can you?

654
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,320
Not once it's made a home...there.

655
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,759
Will you come? One photograph,
that's his next move.

656
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,199
Moriarty's game.

657
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,119
First the scream, then a photograph
of me being taken in for questioning.

658
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,279
He wants to destroy me inch by inch.

659
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,520
It is a game, Lestrade,
and not one I'm willing to play.

660
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,880
Give my regards to Sergeant Donovan.

661
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,479
They'll be deciding. Deciding?

662
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,959
Whether to come back with a warrant
and arrest me. You think?

663
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,599
Standard procedure. You should have
gone with him. People'll think...

664
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,559
I don't care what people think.

665
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,599
You'd care if they thought
you were stupid or wrong.

666
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,999
No, that would just make them
stupid or wrong.

667
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,720
Sherlock, I don't want the world
believing you're...

668
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,280
That I am what?

669
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,880
A fraud.

670
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,960
You're worried they're right. What?

671
00:51:14,961 --> 00:51:17,319
That they're right about me.
No. That's why you're upset.

672
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,079
You can't entertain the possibility
they may be right.

673
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,439
You're afraid you've been taken in.
I'm not.

674
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,120
Moriarty is playing with your mind,
too. Can't you SEE what's going on?!

675
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,399
No, I know you for real.
100 percent?

676
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,880
Well, nobody could fake being such
an annoying dick all the time.

677
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,919
Sherlock Holmes? Yes, sir.

678
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,159
That bloke that's been in the press?

679
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,480
Mm-hm.

680
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,799
I thought he was some sort of private eye.

681
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,279
He is. We've been consulting with
him, that's what you're telling me?

682
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,399
Not used him on any proper cases
though, have we?

683
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,640
Well, one or two.

684
00:51:58,641 --> 00:52:00,279
Or 20 or 30.

685
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,719
What?!

686
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,039
I'm not the only senior officer
who did this. Gregson... Shut up!

687
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,839
An amateur detective given access to
all sorts of classified information.

688
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,959
And now he's a suspect in a case.

689
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,839
With all due respect...
You're a bloody idiot, Lestrade!

690
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,560
Now go and fetch him in, right now.

691
00:52:17,561 --> 00:52:19,120
Do it!

692
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,079
Proud of yourselves? Well,
what if it's not just this case?

693
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,960
What if he's done this to us
every single time?

694
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,119
So, still got some friends
on the force. It's Lestrade.

695
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,078
Says they're all coming over here now.

696
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,920
Queuing up to slap on the handcuffs.

697
00:52:49,921 --> 00:52:52,359
Every officer
you've ever made feel like a tit,

698
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,640
which is a lot of people.

699
00:52:53,641 --> 00:52:55,479
Yoo-hoo.

700
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,399
Oh, sorry, am I interrupting?

701
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,359
Some chap delivered a parcel,
I forgot, marked perishable.

702
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,799
I had to sign for it.

703
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,600
Funny name, German, like the fairy tales.

704
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,000
Burnt to a crisp.

705
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,959
What does it mean?

706
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,799
'Police!' I'll go.

707
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,359
'Sherlock.

708
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,839
'Excuse me, Mrs Hudson.
We need to talk to you.

709
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,200
'You can't just barge in like that!'

710
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,479
- 'Have you got a warrant?
- Have you?'

711
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,960
'Leave it, John.

712
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,039
'Eh? Manners!'

713
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,879
Sherlock Holmes, I'm arresting you on
suspicion of abduction and kidnapping.

714
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,639
It's OK, John. He's not resisting.

715
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,879
No, it's not all right, this is ridiculous.

716
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,199
Get him downstairs now.

717
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,480
You don't have to do this.

718
00:53:48,481 --> 00:53:51,000
Don't try to interfere
or I shall arrest you too.

719
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,319
You done?

720
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,400
I said it. Hmm?

721
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,439
First time we met. Don't bother.

722
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,279
Solving crimes won't be enough.
One day he'll cross the line.

723
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,439
Now ask yourself, what sort of man
would kidnap those kids

724
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,679
just so he can impress us all
by finding them?

725
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,159
Donovan? Sir? Got our man?
Er, yes, sir.

726
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,439
Looked a bit of a weirdo, if you ask me.

727
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,920
Often are, these vigilante types.

728
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,200
What are you looking at?

729
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,960
Are you all right, sir?

730
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,879
Joining me? Yeah.

731
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,119
Well, apparently it's against the law
to chin the Chief Superintendent.

732
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,079
Hmm. Bit awkward this.

733
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,399
There's no-one to bail us.

734
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,799
I was thinking more about
our imminent and daring escape.

735
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,199
'All units to 27.' What?

736
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,759
'All units to 2...'

737
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,239
Aah!

738
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,400
Ladies and gentlemen, will you all
please get on your knees?

739
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,920
NOW would be good! Do as he says!

740
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,599
Just so you're aware, the gun
is his idea, I'm just a...you know.

741
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,839
My hostage. Hostage, yes,
that works. That works.

742
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,279
So what now?

743
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,320
Doing what Moriarty wants,
becoming a fugitive. Run!

744
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,320
Get after him, Lestrade!

745
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,120
Take my hand.

746
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,520
Now people will definitely talk.
The gun! Leave it!

747
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,160
Sherlock, wait!

748
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,480
We're going to need to coordinate.

749
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,200
Go to your right. Huh?
Go to your right.

750
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,479
Everybody wants to believe it,
that's what makes it so clever.

751
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,360
A lie that's preferable to the truth.

752
00:55:54,361 --> 00:55:56,420
My deductions were a sham.

753
00:55:56,421 --> 00:55:58,479
No-one feels inadequate,
Sherlock's an ordinary man.

754
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,639
Mycroft, he could help us.

755
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,440
Big family reconciliation,
now's not really the moment.

756
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,359
Sherlock...we're being followed.
I knew we couldn't outrun the police.

757
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,879
That's not the police, it's one of
my new neighbours from Baker Street.

758
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,240
Let's see if he can give us some answers.

759
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,839
Where are we going?

760
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,080
We're going to jump in front of that bus.

761
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,800
Oof!

762
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,840
Oh...

763
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,479
Tell me what you want from me.

764
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,399
Tell me!

765
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,799
He left it at your flat.

766
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,079
Who? Moriarty.

767
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,559
What?

768
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,759
The computer key code. Of course.

769
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,320
He's selling it. The programme
he used to break into the Tower.

770
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,920
He planted it when he came around.

771
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,399
It's a game-changer.

772
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,839
It's a key, it can break into any system

773
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,599
and it's sitting in our flat right now.

774
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,640
That's why he left that message, telling

775
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:23,679
everyone where to come, "Get Sherlock!"

776
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,159
We need to get back into the flat
and search. CID will be camped out.

777
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,599
Why plant it on you?

778
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,879
It's another subtle way
of smearing my name,

779
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,160
now I'm best pals with all those criminals.

780
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,239
Yeah, well, have you seen this?

781
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,159
A kiss-and-tell.

782
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,120
Some bloke called Rich Brook.

783
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,600
Who is he?

784
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,320
Too late to go on the record?

785
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,759
Congratulations,
"The Truth About Sherlock Holmes."

786
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,919
The scoop that everybody wanted
and you got it. Bravo!

787
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,879
I gave you your opportunity.

788
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,079
I wanted to be on your side, remember?

789
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,360
You turned me down, so...

790
00:58:25,361 --> 00:58:28,239
Then lo and behold,
someone spills all the beans.

791
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,479
How utterly convenient.
Who is Brook?

792
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,799
Oh, come on, Kitty, no-one trusts
the voice at the end of a phone.

793
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,879
All those little meetings in cafes,

794
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,439
those sessions in the hotel room when
he gabbled into your Dictaphone.

795
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,679
How do you know that you can trust him?

796
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,959
A man turns up
with the Holy Grail in his pockets.

797
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,440
What were his credentials?

798
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,760
Darling, they didn't have any
ground coffee, so I just got normal.

799
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:04,559
You said that they wouldn't find me
here, you said that I'd be safe here.

800
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,599
You are safe.

801
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,039
Richard, I'm a witness, they wouldn't
harm you in front of witnesses.

802
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,439
So that's your source?
Moriarty is Richard Brook?

803
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,199
Of course he's Richard Brook,
there is no Moriarty.

804
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,039
There never has been. What are you
talking about? Look him up.

805
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:23,760
Rich Brook, an actor Sherlock Holmes
hired to be Moriarty.

806
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,439
Dr Watson, I know you're a good man,

807
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,799
don't, don't, don't hurt me.

808
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,799
No, you are Moriarty!
He's Moriarty!

809
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,799
We've met, remember?
You were going to blow me up!

810
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,279
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

811
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,919
He paid me, I needed the work.
I'm an actor, I was out of work.

812
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,159
Sherlock, you'd better explain,
because I am not getting this.

813
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,879
I'll be doing the explaining, in print.

814
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,640
It's all here, conclusive proof.

815
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,639
You invented James Moriarty, your nemesis.

816
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,479
Invented him?! Mm-hm.

817
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,919
He invented all the crimes, actually.

818
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,439
And to cap it all,
he made up a master villain.

819
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,079
Don't be ridiculous! Ask him.
He's right here. Just ask him.

820
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,359
Tell him, Richard. For God's sake,
this man was on trial!

821
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:17,199
Yes, and you paid him to take the
rap. Promised you'd rig the jury.

822
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,639
Not exactly a West End role,
but I'll bet the money was good.

823
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,519
But not so good he didn't
want to sell his story.

824
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,079
I am sorry. I am. I am sorry.

825
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,719
So this is the story
you're going to publish?

826
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,919
The big conclusion of it all,
Moriarty's an actor? He knows I am.

827
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,919
I have proof. Show them...
Kitty, show them something.

828
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,920
Yeah, show me something.

829
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:46,280
I'm on TV. I'm on kids' TV.
I'm the story-teller.

830
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,640
I'm the story-teller. It's on DVD.

831
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,079
Just tell him.
It's all coming out. It's all over.

832
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,559
Just tell them. Just tell them.
Tell them! It's all over now!

833
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,599
No! Don't you touch me!
Don't you lay a finger on me!

834
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,639
Stop it now!

835
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,199
Don't hurt me!
Don't let him get away!

836
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,520
Leave him alone!

837
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,519
No, no, no. He'll have back-up.

838
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,479
Do you know what, Sherlock Holmes?

839
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:29,000
I look at you know and I can
read you...and you repel me.

840
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,479
Can he do that?

841
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,359
Completely change his identity,
make you the criminal?

842
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,279
He's got my whole life story.

843
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,359
That's what you do when you sell a big lie,

844
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,999
you wrap it up in the truth
to make it more palatable.

845
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,839
It'll be your word against his.

846
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,039
He's been sowing doubt into
people's minds for 24 hours.

847
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:54,040
There's only one thing he needs to
do to complete his game and that...

848
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,480
Sherlock?

849
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,600
There's something I need to do.
What? Can I help? No, on my own.

850
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,280
You're wrong, you know?

851
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,480
You do count.

852
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,000
You've always counted
and I've always trusted you.

853
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,320
But you were right.

854
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,119
I'm not OK.

855
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,400
Tell me what's wrong.

856
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,680
Molly, I think I'm going to die.

857
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:48,119
What do you need? If I wasn't
everything that you think I am,

858
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,320
everything that I think I am...

859
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,640
..would you still want to help me?

860
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,440
What do you need?

861
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,360
You.

862
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:24,039
She has really done her homework,
Miss Riley,

863
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:28,040
and it's things that only someone
close to Sherlock could know.

864
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:32,519
Ah. Have you seen your brother's
address book lately?

865
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:36,039
Two names - yours and mine...

866
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:39,039
and Moriarty didn't get this stuff from me.

867
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:42,559
John... So how does it work,
your relationship?

868
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:46,239
Do you go out for a coffee
now and then, you and Jim?

869
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,439
Your own brother

870
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:54,320
and you blabbed about his entire
life to this maniac.

871
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,039
I never intend...I never dreamt...

872
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:03,119
This...this is what you were
trying to tell me, isn't it?

873
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,040
"Watch his back
because I've made a mistake."

874
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,600
How did you meet him?

875
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:19,360
People like him,
we know about them, we watch them.

876
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,040
But James Moriarty...

877
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,319
..the most dangerous criminal mind
the world has ever seen,

878
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,439
and, in his pocket, the ultimate weapon.

879
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,559
The key code.

880
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:38,520
A few lines of computer code
that can unlock any door.

881
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:44,040
And you abducted him
to try and find the key code?

882
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,559
Interrogated him for weeks.

883
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:50,600
And? He wouldn't play along.

884
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,279
He just sat there

885
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:57,040
staring into the darkness.

886
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,040
The only thing that made him open up...

887
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,040
I could get him to talk, just a little.

888
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,279
But...

889
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,840
In return you had to offer him
Sherlock's life story.

890
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,320
So, one big lie...

891
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,359
..Sherlock's a fraud,

892
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:28,160
and people will swallow it
because the rest of it's true.

893
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,679
Moriarty wanted Sherlock destroyed, right,

894
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:38,040
and you have given him
the perfect ammunition.

895
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,040
John.

896
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,759
I'm sorry.

897
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,680
Oh, please!

898
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,520
Tell him, would you?

899
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,759
I got your message.

900
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,359
The computer code is the key to
this. We find it, we can use it.

901
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:16,279
Use it? He used it to create
a false identity

902
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:19,119
so we can break into the records
and destroy Richard Brook.

903
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,799
Bring back Jim Moriarty again.

904
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,880
Somewhere in 221b,

905
01:06:21,881 --> 01:06:24,679
somewhere on the day of the verdict
he left it hidden.

906
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,040
Uh-huh.

907
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,919
What did he touch?
An apple, nothing else.

908
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,640
Did he write anything down?
No.

909
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,040
Oh.

910
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,679
Yeah, speaking.

911
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:27,959
What?

912
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,879
What happened? Is she OK?

913
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,439
Oh, my God! Right, yes, I'm coming.

914
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,639
What is it? Paramedics.
Mrs Hudson's been shot.

915
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,919
How? Probably one of the killers
you managed to attract. Jesus!

916
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,759
She's dying, Sherlock. Let's go.
You go. I'm busy.

917
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,319
Busy?!
Thinking. I need to think.

918
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,959
You need to...?
Doesn't she mean anything to you?

919
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,879
You once half-killed a man
because he laid a finger on her.

920
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,719
She's my landlady.
She's dying...you machine!

921
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,039
Sod this. Sod this! You stay here
if you want, on your own.

922
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,559
Alone is what I have.
Alone protects me.

923
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,640
No, friends protect people.

924
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,799
# I've been kicked around since I was born

925
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,239
# But now it's all right, it's OK

926
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,279
# You can look the other way

927
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,479
# We can try to understand

928
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,999
# The New York Times' effect on man

929
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,919
# Whether you're a brother
or whether you're a mother

930
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,039
# You're stayin' alive... #

931
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:43,039
Well...here we are at last.

932
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,159
You and me, Sherlock.

933
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,679
And our problem - the final problem.

934
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,760
Staying alive!

935
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,120
It's so boring, isn't it?

936
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,520
It's just staying.

937
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,519
All my life I've been searching
for distractions

938
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,599
and you were the best distraction
and now I don't even have you

939
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,959
because I've beaten you.

940
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,040
And you know what?
In the end, it was easy.

941
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,119
It was easy.

942
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,399
Now I've got to go back to playing
with the ordinary people,

943
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,520
and it turns out you're ordinary,
just like all of them.

944
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,440
Ah, well.

945
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:32,679
Did you almost start to wonder
if I was real?

946
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:35,359
Did I nearly get you?

947
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,719
Richard Brook.

948
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:41,799
Nobody seems to get the joke, but you do.

949
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,879
Of course. Attaboy.

950
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,599
Richard Brook in German is Reichenbach.

951
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,680
The case that made my name.
Just trying to have some fun.

952
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:58,120
Good. You got that too.

953
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,039
Beats like digits.

954
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:06,039
Every beat is a one, every rest is a zero.

955
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,719
Binary code.

956
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,559
That's why all those assassins
tried to save my life.

957
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,239
It was hidden on me, hidden inside my head.

958
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:16,679
A few simple lines of computer code
that can break into any system.

959
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:21,159
Told all my clients,
last one to Sherlock is a sissy.

960
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:26,040
But now that it's up here, I can
use it to alter all the records.

961
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:31,000
I can kill Rich Brook
and bring back Jim Moriarty.

962
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,319
No, no, no, no, no.
This is too easy.

963
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,239
This is too easy.

964
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,720
There is no key, doofus!

965
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,159
Those digits are meaningless.
They're utterly meaningless.

966
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,759
You don't really think a couple
of lines of computer code

967
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,439
are going to crash the world
around our ears?

968
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:57,119
I'm disappointed in you, ordinary Sherlock.

969
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:02,679
But the rhythm... Partita no 1!
Thank you, Johann Sebastian Bach.

970
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,740
But then how did you...? How did I break

971
01:11:04,741 --> 01:11:06,799
into the bank, to the Tower, to the prison?

972
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,040
Daylight robbery! All it takes
is some willing participants.

973
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,839
I knew you'd fall for it.
That's your weakness.

974
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,279
You always want everything to be clever.

975
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,959
Shall we finish the game?
One final act.

976
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,399
Glad you chose a tall building.
Nice way to do it.

977
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,440
Do it? Do what?

978
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,040
Yes, of course.

979
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,559
My suicide.

980
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,119
Genius detective proved to be a fraud.

981
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,879
I read it in the paper so it must be true.

982
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,319
I love newspapers.

983
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,400
Fairy tales.

984
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,040
And pretty grim ones too.

985
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:06,199
Oh, God, John, you made me jump.
Is everything OK with the police?

986
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,840
Has Sherlock sorted it all out?

987
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,360
Oh, my God.

988
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:17,720
Taxi!

989
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,319
Taxi!
No, no, no. Police...sort of!

990
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,319
Thanks, mate. Thanks a lot!

991
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:27,359
I can prove that you created
an entirely false identity.

992
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,520
Oh, just kill yourself.
It's a lot less effort.

993
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,879
Go on.

994
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,319
For me.

995
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,040
Please!

996
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,720
You're insane.

997
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:47,359
You're just getting that now?
Wo-wo-wo!

998
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,040
OK.

999
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:53,879
Let me give you a little extra incentive.

1000
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,040
Your friends will die if you don't.

1001
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,319
John?

1002
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,520
Not just John. Everyone.

1003
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,439
Mrs Hudson? Everyone.

1004
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:10,319
Lestrade? Three bullets,
three gunmen, three victims.

1005
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,760
There's no stopping them now...

1006
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,280
..unless my people see you jump.

1007
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,439
You can have me arrested,
you can torture me,

1008
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:31,039
you can do anything you like with me,

1009
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:34,639
but nothing's going to prevent them
from pulling the trigger.

1010
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,919
Your only three friends in the world
will die unless...

1011
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,040
Unless I kill myself
and complete your story.

1012
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,839
You've got to admit, that's sexier.

1013
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:49,519
And I die in disgrace. Of course.
That's the point of this.

1014
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,600
Oh. You've got an audience now.

1015
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,040
Off you pop.

1016
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,440
Go on.

1017
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,600
I told you how this ends.

1018
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,759
Your death is the only thing that's
going to call off the killers.

1019
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,040
I'm certainly not going to do it.

1020
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,800
Would you give me one moment, please?

1021
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,920
One moment of privacy.

1022
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,440
Please.

1023
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,320
Of course.

1024
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,759
What?!

1025
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,960
What is it?

1026
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,040
What did I miss?

1027
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,439
You're not going to do it.

1028
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,439
So the killers can be called off,

1029
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,440
then there's a recall code
or a word or a number.

1030
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:15,359
I don't have to die if I've got you.

1031
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,000
Oh!

1032
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,679
You think you can make me stop the order?

1033
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,039
You think you can make me do that?
Yes.

1034
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,959
So do you. Sherlock, your big
brother and all the King's horses

1035
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,479
couldn't make me do a thing
I didn't want to.

1036
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,840
Yes, but I'm not my brother, remember?

1037
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,039
I am you.

1038
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,239
Prepared to do anything.

1039
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,439
Prepared to burn.

1040
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:44,119
Prepared to do what ordinary
people won't do.

1041
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:48,960
You want me to shake hands with you
in hell? I shall not disappoint you.

1042
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,640
Nah.

1043
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,199
You talk big.

1044
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,199
Nah.

1045
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,279
You're ordinary.

1046
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,239
You're ordinary.
You're on the side of the angels.

1047
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:05,319
Oh, I may be on the side of the angels,

1048
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:11,040
but don't think for one second
that I am one of them.

1049
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,800
No...

1050
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,520
..you're not.

1051
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I see.

1052
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,799
You're not ordinary.

1053
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,320
No.

1054
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,600
You're me.

1055
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,240
You're me.

1056
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,200
Thank you...

1057
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,240
..Sherlock Holmes.

1058
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,200
Thank you.

1059
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,040
Bless you.

1060
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,040
As long as I'm alive, you can save
your friends, you've got a way out.

1061
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,160
Well, good luck with that.

1062
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,040
No.

1063
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,880
Yes, sir. Thank you. Bye.

1064
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,319
Hello?

1065
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,759
John.
Hey, Sherlock. Are you OK?

1066
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:46,079
Turn around and walk back
the way you came. I'm coming in.

1067
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,239
Just do as I ask!

1068
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:49,639
Please.

1069
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,360
Where?

1070
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,559
Stop there.

1071
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,720
Sherlock?
OK, look up. I'm on the rooftop.

1072
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:01,319
Oh, God.

1073
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:05,799
I...I can't come down, so we'll
just have to do it like this.

1074
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,999
What's going on?

1075
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,960
An apology.

1076
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,039
It's all true.

1077
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,039
What?

1078
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:21,280
Everything they said about me.
I invented Moriarty.

1079
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,360
Why are you saying this?

1080
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,319
I'm a fake.

1081
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:37,999
Sherlock...
The newspapers were right all along.

1082
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,039
I want you to tell Lestrade,

1083
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,799
I want you to tell Mrs Hudson and Molly.

1084
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,760
In fact, tell anyone who will
listen to you...

1085
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,520
..that I created Moriarty
for my own purposes.

1086
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,119
OK, shut up Sherlock. Shut up.

1087
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,999
The first time we met...
the first time we met,

1088
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,519
you knew all about my sister, right?
Nobody could be that clever.

1089
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,400
You could.

1090
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,440
I researched you.

1091
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,639
Before we met, I discovered
everything that I could

1092
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,920
to impress you.

1093
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,639
It's a trick. Just a magic trick.

1094
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,959
No. All right, stop it now.

1095
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,520
No. Stay exactly where you are.

1096
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,440
Don't move. All right.

1097
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,119
Keep your eyes fixed on me.

1098
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,479
Please, will you do this for me?
Do what?

1099
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,160
This phone call, it's...

1100
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:45,040
..it's my note.

1101
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,840
It's what people do, don't they?

1102
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,680
Leave a note?

1103
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,439
Leave a note when?

1104
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,400
Goodbye, John. No. Don't...

1105
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,960
Sherlock!

1106
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,840
Sherlock.

1107
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,320
Sherlock...Sherlock.

1108
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:12,159
I'm a doctor, let me come through.
Let me come through, please.

1109
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,600
He's my friend. He's my friend...
Please.

1110
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,920
Please, let me just...

1111
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,439
Oh, Jesus!

1112
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,119
No.

1113
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,800
God, no.

1114
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,440
There's stuff that you wanted to say...

1115
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:31,040
..but didn't say it. Yeah.

1116
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,720
Say it now.

1117
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,320
Sorry, I can't.

1118
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:58,039
There's all the stuff.
All the science equipment.

1119
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:01,519
I left it all in boxes.
I don't know what needs doing.

1120
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,040
I thought I'd take it to a school.

1121
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:10,040
Would you...? I can't go back to
the flat again, not at the moment.

1122
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,519
I'm angry.

1123
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:17,439
It's OK, John.
There's nothing unusual in that.

1124
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,999
That's the way he made everyone feel.

1125
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,679
All the marks on my table and the noise,

1126
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:26,999
firing guns at half past one
in the morning... Yeah.

1127
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,399
..bloody specimens in my fridge.

1128
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:32,519
Imagine, keeping bodies
where there's food. Yes.

1129
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:36,559
And the fighting! Drove me up
the wall with all his carryings-on.

1130
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,239
Listen, I'm not actually that angry, OK?

1131
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:43,280
OK. I'll leave you alone to,
you know...

1132
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,680
Erm...

1133
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,039
Hmm.

1134
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:01,040
You...you told me once...

1135
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,399
..that you weren't a hero.

1136
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:08,199
Erm, there were times I didn't
even think you were human,

1137
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,319
but let me tell you this, you were...

1138
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,999
the best man...

1139
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,999
the most human...human being
that I've ever known

1140
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,040
and no-one will ever convince me
that you told me a lie, so...

1141
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,240
..there.

1142
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,280
I was so alone...

1143
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,040
..and I owe you so much.

1144
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:46,079
But, please, there's just one
more thing, one more thing,

1145
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,480
one more miracle, Sherlock,
for me, don't be...

1146
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,519
..dead.

1147
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,999
Would you do that just for me?

1148
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,360
Just stop it. Stop this.

1149
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:13,360
