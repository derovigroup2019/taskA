1
00:00:00,103 --> 00:00:02,582
Mr Magnussen, please state your
full name for the record.

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,718
Charles Augustus Magnussen.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,926
Mr Magnussen,

4
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:12,126
how would you describe your
influence over the Prime Minister?

5
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:13,686
The British Prime Minister?

6
00:00:13,687 --> 00:00:16,766
Any of the British Prime Ministers
you have known.

7
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,926
I never had the slightest
influence over any of them.

8
00:00:19,927 --> 00:00:21,407
Why would I?

9
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:28,486
I notice you've had seven meetings
at Downing Street this year.

10
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,286
Why?

11
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:32,886
Because I was invited.

12
00:00:32,887 --> 00:00:35,686
Can you recall the subjects
under discussion?

13
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:39,366
Not without being more indiscreet
than I believe is appropriate.

14
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:41,846
Do you think it right that
a newspaper proprietor,

15
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:45,606
a private individual,
and in fact a foreign national,

16
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:49,127
should have such regular access
to our Prime Minister?

17
00:00:51,527 --> 00:00:54,766
I don't think it's wrong that
a private individual should

18
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:56,726
accept an invitation.

19
00:00:56,727 --> 00:01:00,126
However, you have my sincere
apologies for being foreign.

20
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:03,206
That's not what I meant. That is
not in any way...

21
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:05,326
Mr Magnussen,
can you recall an occasion

22
00:01:05,327 --> 00:01:08,886
when your remarks could have
influenced government policy?

23
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:11,567
Or the Prime Minister's
thinking in any way?

24
00:01:12,927 --> 00:01:14,446
No.

25
00:01:14,447 --> 00:01:15,647
Are you sure?

26
00:01:28,207 --> 00:01:30,127
I have an excellent memory.

27
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:45,087
Your car is waiting outside...
See you tomorrow.

28
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:56,686
May I join you?

29
00:02:56,687 --> 00:02:58,726
I don't think it's appropriate.

30
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:02,566
It isn't. Mr Magnussen, outside the
inquiry, we can have no contact,

31
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:04,007
no communication at all.

32
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:07,326
Please don't do that.

33
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:12,366
In 1982, your husband corresponded
with Helen Catherine Driscoll.

34
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:13,766
That was before I knew him.

35
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:16,326
The letters were lively, loving...

36
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:18,286
some would say explicit.

37
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:20,446
And currently in my possession.

38
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:22,366
Will you please move your hand?

39
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:27,286
"I long, my darling, to know
the touch of your... body."

40
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:29,286
I know what was in the letters.

41
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:30,727
She was 15.

42
00:03:32,847 --> 00:03:34,447
She looked older.

43
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:40,206
Oh, she looked delicious.
We have photographs too.

44
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:41,847
The ones she sent him.

45
00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:44,686
Yum-yum.

46
00:03:44,687 --> 00:03:46,646
He was unaware of her age.

47
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:48,806
He met her only
once before the letters began.

48
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:51,686
When he discovered the truth,
he stopped immediately.

49
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:53,406
Those are the facts.

50
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:56,166
Facts are for history books.
I work in news.

51
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:57,846
Your hand is sweating.

52
00:03:57,847 --> 00:04:00,606
Always, I'm afraid.
I have a condition.

53
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,927
It's disgusting.

54
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,686
I'm used to it.

55
00:04:04,687 --> 00:04:07,766
The whole world is wet to my touch.

56
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:10,646
I will call someone,
I will have you removed.

57
00:04:10,647 --> 00:04:12,047
What is that?

58
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:18,687
Claire de la Lune?

59
00:04:19,887 --> 00:04:21,527
A bit young for you, isn't it?

60
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:27,086
You want to hit me now?
Could you, still?

61
00:04:27,087 --> 00:04:28,926
Little old lady now.

62
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:32,687
Perhaps you should
settle for calling someone.

63
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:37,766
Well, go on.

64
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:39,166
No?

65
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:41,326
Because now there are consequences.

66
00:04:41,327 --> 00:04:43,726
I have the letters
and therefore I have you.

67
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:45,406
This is blackmail.

68
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:46,966
Of course it isn't blackmail.

69
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:49,286
This is...

70
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:50,446
ownership.

71
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:52,487
You do not own me.

72
00:05:05,207 --> 00:05:06,687
Claire de la Lune.

73
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:14,127
It never tastes like it smells,
does it?

74
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,686
Lady Smallwood's bill is on me.
See to it.

75
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:25,087
Yes, Mr Magnussen.

76
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:36,287
Oh, God! Oh!

77
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:38,886
You all right, ma'am?

78
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:40,007
Fine, yes.

79
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,807
Magnussen!

80
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:45,766
No-one stands up to him.

81
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:48,086
No-one dares, no-one even tries.

82
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:51,126
There isn't a man or woman
in England capable of stopping

83
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:52,727
that disgusting creature...

84
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:56,966
Ma'am?

85
00:05:56,967 --> 00:06:00,447
Turn the car around. We're going
back into town. Turn around.

86
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,887
Where are we going, ma'am?

87
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:06,047
Baker Street.

88
00:06:06,426 --> 00:06:38,309
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

89
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:48,166
'You've seen a lot of injuries,
then? Violent deaths?'

90
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:50,566
'Enough for a lifetime.'
'Want to see some more?'

91
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:52,127
'Oh, God, yes.'

92
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:55,207
'The game is on.'

93
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:03,967
I know it's early.
Really, I'm sorry.

94
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:08,046
Is that Kate?
Yeah, it's Kate.

95
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:09,526
Invite her in?

96
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:11,567
Er, sorry, yes,
do you want to come in, Kate?

97
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:15,166
Hey!

98
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:16,487
It's hard.

99
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:22,206
There you go. It's Isaac.
Oh, your husband? Son. Son, yeah.

100
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:25,726
He's gone missing again.
Didn't come home last night.

101
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:26,966
The usual.

102
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:28,846
He's the drugs one, yeah?

103
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:30,966
Er, yeah, nicely put, John.

104
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:33,926
But is it Sherlock Holmes you want?
Because I've not seen him in ages.

105
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:36,006
About a month.
Who is Sherlock Holmes?

106
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:37,726
See, that does happen.

107
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:42,247
There's a place they all go to,
him and his friends.

108
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,207
They all do whatever they do.

109
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:50,526
Shoot up, whatever you call it.

110
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,246
Where is he? It's a house, it's a
dump. It's practically falling down.

111
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:57,366
No, the address? Where, exactly?

112
00:07:57,367 --> 00:07:58,766
Seriously? Why not?

113
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:01,126
She's not going to the police,
someone's got to get him.

114
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:03,366
Why you? I'm being neighbourly.
Since when?

115
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:06,006
Ha, since now.
Since this exact minute.

116
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:08,526
Why are you being so...? What?

117
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:10,326
I don't know,
what's the matter with you?

118
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:12,326
There is NOTHING the matter with me.

119
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:15,126
Imagine I said that without
shouting. I'm trying.

120
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,126
No, you can't come, you're pregnant.

121
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:18,727
You can't go, I'm pregnant!

122
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,846
What is that?!

123
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:32,966
It's a tyre lever. Why? Cos there
were loads of smackheads in there

124
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:34,966
and one of them
might need help with a tyre.

125
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:37,486
If there's any trouble,
just go, I'll be fine.

126
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:39,287
John, John, John, John...

127
00:08:40,407 --> 00:08:42,366
It is a tiny bit sexy.

128
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:43,847
Yeah, I know.

129
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:48,327
Hello?

130
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,127
What do you want? Excuse me.

131
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:57,926
Oh, no, you can't come in here!

132
00:08:57,927 --> 00:09:02,446
I'm looking for a friend.
A very specific... friend.

133
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:03,966
I'm not just browsing.

134
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:07,406
You've got to go.
No-one's allowed here.

135
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:10,246
Isaac Whitney, you seen him?

136
00:09:10,247 --> 00:09:13,086
I'm asking you
if you've seen Isaac Whitney

137
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:14,526
and now you're showing me a knife.

138
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:17,926
Is it a clue? Are you doing a mime?

139
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:20,966
Go. Or I'll cut you.

140
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:23,487
Oh, not from there. Let me help.

141
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:30,126
Now, concentrate. Isaac... Whitney?

142
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:31,607
OK, you asked for it.

143
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:37,446
Agh! Ohh!

144
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:40,326
Right. Are you concentrating yet?

145
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:41,886
You broke my arm!

146
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,206
No, I sprained it.

147
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,886
It feels squishy.
Is it supposed to feel squishy?

148
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,966
Feel that! Yeah, it's a sprain.

149
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,966
I'm a doctor,
I know how to sprain people.

150
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:53,086
Now where is Isaac Whitney?

151
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:56,206
I don't know! Maybe upstairs.

152
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:58,447
There you go. Wasn't that easy?

153
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,926
No, it was really sore.

154
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:03,446
Mental, you are!

155
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:06,207
No, just used to a better
class of criminal.

156
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:20,527
Isaac? Isaac Whitney?

157
00:10:22,807 --> 00:10:23,887
Isaac?

158
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:30,047
Hello, mate. Sit up for me, sit up.

159
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:33,726
Dr Watson? Yep.

160
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:35,166
Where am I?

161
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,806
Arse-end of the universe with
the scum of the earth. Look at me.

162
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:40,206
Have you come for me?

163
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,886
Do you think
I know a lot of people here?

164
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:45,246
Hey, all right?

165
00:10:45,247 --> 00:10:49,647
Oh, hello, John.
Didn't expect to see you here.

166
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:54,407
Come for me too?

167
00:10:56,567 --> 00:11:00,686
Hello, Isaac. Mrs Watson,
can I, can I get in, please?

168
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:03,726
Yes, of course, get in. Where's
John? They're having a fight.

169
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:05,126
Who is?!

170
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:07,646
For God sakes, John, I'm on a case!

171
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,086
A month. That's all it took.

172
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:10,926
One! I'm working.

173
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:13,446
"Sherlock Holmes in a drug den."
How's that going to look?!

174
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:15,366
I'm undercover. No, you're not!

175
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:17,606
Well, I'm not now!

176
00:11:17,607 --> 00:11:20,007
In, both of you, quickly!

177
00:11:25,327 --> 00:11:28,806
Please, can I come?
I think I've got a broken arm.

178
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:32,327
No, go away. No, let him. Why?
Yeah, just get in. It's a sprain.

179
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:36,767
Anyone else? I mean, are we taking
everybody home, are we?

180
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:39,526
All right, Shezza?

181
00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:41,686
"Shezza"? I WAS undercover!

182
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:43,206
Seriously, Shezza, though?

183
00:11:43,207 --> 00:11:46,166
We're not going home, we're going to
Bart's. I'm calling Molly. Why?

184
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:49,367
Because Sherlock Holmes needs
to pee in a jar.

185
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,807
Well? Is he clean?

186
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:05,087
Clean?

187
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:17,286
How dare you throw away the
beautiful gifts you were born with!

188
00:12:17,287 --> 00:12:19,406
And how dare you betray
the love of your friends!

189
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:20,686
Say you're sorry.

190
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:24,126
Sorry your engagement's over. Though
I'm fairly grateful for the lack of a ring.

191
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:27,486
Stop it. Just stop it!

192
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:29,926
If you were anywhere near this
kind of thing again,

193
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:32,206
you could have called,
you could have talked to me.

194
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:34,166
Please, do relax.
This is all for a case.

195
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:36,166
What kind of case would need
you doing this?

196
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:39,006
I might as well ask you why you've
started cycling to work?

197
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:40,966
No, we're not playing this game.

198
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:43,486
Quite recently, I'd say,
you're very determined about it.

199
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:45,686
Not interested. I am. Ow!

200
00:12:45,687 --> 00:12:48,326
Oh, sorry, you moved,
but it is just a sprain.

201
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:50,847
Yeah, somebody hit me. Huh?

202
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:54,647
Yeah, just some guy.

203
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:58,727
Yeah, it was probably just
an addict in need of a fix.

204
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:01,407
Yes, I think in a way it was.

205
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,686
Is it his shirt? I'm sorry?

206
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:07,607
Well, it's the creases, isn't it?

207
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:11,926
The two creases down the front.

208
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:14,406
It's been recently folded,
but it's not new.

209
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:16,926
You must have dressed in a hurry
this morning.

210
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,247
So all your shirts must be
kept like that.

211
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:22,526
But why?

212
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:25,286
Maybe cos you cycle to work
every morning, shower

213
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:28,726
when you get there and then dress
in the clothes you brought with you.

214
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:32,447
You keep your shirts folded,
ready to pack.

215
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:34,846
Not bad.

216
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,367
And I further deduce...

217
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:42,166
you've only started recently
because you've got a bit of chafing.

218
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:43,886
No, he's always walked like that.

219
00:13:43,887 --> 00:13:45,526
Remind me, what's your name again?

220
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:48,246
They call me the Wig.
No, they don't.

221
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:50,246
Well, they... they call me Wiggy.

222
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,367
Nope.

223
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:56,446
Bill. Bill Wiggins.

224
00:13:56,447 --> 00:13:58,727
Nice observational skills, Billy.

225
00:14:00,847 --> 00:14:03,526
Ah, finally!

226
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:05,726
Finally what? Good news?

227
00:14:05,727 --> 00:14:08,286
Oh, excellent news, the best.

228
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:11,246
There's every chance that my drug
habit might hit the newspapers.

229
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:15,327
The game is on.
Excuse me... for a second.

230
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:21,206
You've heard of Charles Augustus
Magnussen, of course?

231
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:24,606
Yeah. Owns some newspapers.
Ones I don't read.

232
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,886
Hang on, weren't there other people?

233
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:30,126
Mary's taking the boys home,
I'm taking you, we did discuss it.

234
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:33,566
People were talking, none of them
were me, I must have filtered.

235
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,966
I noticed. I have to filter out
a lot of witless babble.

236
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:38,527
I've got Mrs Hudson
on semi-permanent mute.

237
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:44,406
What is my brother doing here?

238
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:46,606
So I'll just pay, then, shall I?

239
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:48,286
He's straightened the knocker.

240
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,726
He always corrects it, it's OCD,
doesn't even know he's doing it.

241
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:55,127
Why do you do that? Do what?
Nothing.

242
00:14:58,007 --> 00:15:00,846
Well then, Sherlock,
back on the sauce?

243
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:02,886
What are you doing here?
I phoned him.

244
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:06,646
The siren call of old habits.
How very like Uncle Rudy.

245
00:15:06,647 --> 00:15:10,686
Though in many ways, cross-dressing would have
been a wiser path for you. You phoned him.

246
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:13,046
Of course I bloody phoned him.
Of course he bloody did.

247
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:15,766
Now save me a little time -
where should we be looking?

248
00:15:15,767 --> 00:15:17,607
Mr Holmes?

249
00:15:19,247 --> 00:15:20,767
For God's sake!

250
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:28,166
Anderson?! Sorry, Sherlock,
it's for your own good.

251
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:31,926
Oh, that's him, isn't it?
You said he'd be taller.

252
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:35,526
Some members of your little fan
club. Do be polite.

253
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:38,166
They're entirely trustworthy
and even willing to search

254
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:41,326
through the toxic waste dump that
you are pleased to call a flat.

255
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:43,446
You're a celebrity these days,
Sherlock.

256
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:45,006
You can't afford a drug habit.

257
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:48,726
- I do not have a drug habit.
- Hey, what happened to my chair?

258
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:50,966
It was blocking my view to the
kitchen.

259
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:52,366
Well, it's good to be missed!

260
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:55,686
You were gone, I saw an opportunity.
No, you saw the kitchen.

261
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:57,646
What have you found so far?
Clearly, nothing.

262
00:15:57,647 --> 00:15:59,246
There's nothing to find!

263
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:02,166
Your bedroom door is shut.
You haven't been home all night.

264
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:05,406
So, why would a man who has never
knowingly closed a door without

265
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:08,726
the direct orders of his mother
bother to do so on this occasion?

266
00:16:08,727 --> 00:16:11,886
OK, stop, just stop! Point made.

267
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,366
Jesus, Sherlock!

268
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:17,006
I shall have to phone our parents,
of course. In Oklahoma.

269
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:19,726
It won't be the first time that
your substance abuse

270
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:22,207
has wreaked
havoc with their line dancing.

271
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:27,486
This is not what you think.
This is for a case.

272
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,606
What case could possibly
justify this?

273
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:31,526
Magnussen.

274
00:16:31,527 --> 00:16:33,967
Charles Augustus Magnussen.

275
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:42,086
That name you think you may have
just heard, you were mistaken.

276
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:44,526
If you ever mention hearing that
name in this room,

277
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:47,206
in this context,
I guarantee you, on behalf

278
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:50,126
of the British Security Services,
that materials will be found on

279
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:54,086
your computer hard-drives, resulting
in your immediate incarceration.

280
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:56,927
Don't reply, just look frightened
and scuttle.

281
00:16:59,487 --> 00:17:02,127
I hope I won't have to
threaten you as well.

282
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:07,086
Well, I think we'd both find
that embarrassing.

283
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:08,686
Magnussen is not your business.

284
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:11,686
Oh, you mean he's yours? You may
consider him under my protection.

285
00:17:11,687 --> 00:17:13,446
I consider you under his thumb.

286
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:15,366
If you go against Magnussen,

287
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,606
then you will find yourself
going against me.

288
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:19,926
OK. I'll let you know if I notice.

289
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:22,806
Um, what was I going to say?
Oh, yeah.

290
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:24,407
Bye-bye.

291
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:30,646
Unwise, brother mine.

292
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,846
Ohh! Ugh!

293
00:17:32,847 --> 00:17:34,007
Brother mine...

294
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,806
don't appal me when I'm high.

295
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,646
Mycroft, don't say another word,
just go.

296
00:17:40,647 --> 00:17:43,006
He could snap you in two
and right now,

297
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:45,607
I'm slightly worried that he might.

298
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:49,647
Don't speak, just leave.

299
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:53,127
Oh.

300
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:04,246
Er, Magnussen?

301
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:07,166
What time is it? About eight.

302
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:09,806
I'll be meeting him in three hours.
I need a bath.

303
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:12,806
It's for a case, you say? Yep.
What sort of case?

304
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:15,606
Too big and dangerous for any sane
individual to get involved in.

305
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:18,366
You trying to put me off? God, no.

306
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:19,687
Trying to recruit you.

307
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,007
And stay out of my bedroom.

308
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:36,526
Oh, John, hi. How are you?

309
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:37,646
Janine?

310
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:40,806
Sorry, not dressed.
Has everybody gone?

311
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:43,206
I heard shouting.
Yes, they're gone.

312
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,366
God, look at the time. I'll be late.

313
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:48,486
It sounded like an argument.
Was it Mike? Mike?

314
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:51,606
Mike, yeah. His brother, Mike.
They're always fighting.

315
00:18:51,607 --> 00:18:52,846
Mycroft.

316
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:54,406
Do people actually call him that?

317
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:55,606
Yeah. Huh!

318
00:18:55,607 --> 00:18:57,726
Oh, could you be a love
and put some coffee on?

319
00:18:57,727 --> 00:18:59,166
Sure, right, yeah.

320
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:02,806
Thanks. Oh, how is Mary?
How's married life?

321
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:05,326
She's fine. We're both fine. Yeah.

322
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:08,286
Oh, it's over there now.
Where's Sherl?

323
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:10,366
Sherl!

324
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:13,246
Er, he's just having a bath.
I'm sure he'll be out in a minute.

325
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:15,207
Oh, like he ever is! Yeah.

326
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:21,087
Morning. Room for a little one?

327
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:26,367
Morning.

328
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,526
Ooh!

329
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:33,486
So, it's just a guess, but you've
probably got some questions?

330
00:19:33,487 --> 00:19:35,846
Yeah, one or two. Pretty much.

331
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:37,247
Naturally.

332
00:19:43,087 --> 00:19:45,527
You have a girlfriend? Yes, I have.

333
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,166
Now, Magnussen.
Magnussen is like a shark.

334
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,966
It's the only way
I can describe him.

335
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:54,886
Have you ever been to the shark
tank at the London Aquarium, John?
Stood up close to the glass?

336
00:19:54,887 --> 00:20:00,327
Those floating, flat faces,
those dead eyes. That's what he is.

337
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:04,846
I've dealt with murderers,
psychopaths,

338
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:07,126
terrorists, serial killers.

339
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:11,967
None of them can turn my stomach
like Charles Augustus Magnussen.

340
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:15,086
Yes, you have?

341
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:16,446
Sorry, what?

342
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:19,566
You have a girlfriend? What? Yes,
yes, I'm going out with Janine.

343
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:22,367
I thought that was fairly obvious.
Yes. Well, yes.

344
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:27,246
You... You... You are
in a relationship?

345
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:29,046
Yes, I am.

346
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:31,886
You and Janine? Hmm.
Yes, me and Janine.

347
00:20:31,887 --> 00:20:33,007
Care to elaborate?

348
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:37,806
Well, we're in a good place.
It's, um...

349
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:40,086
very affirming.
You got that from a book.

350
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:42,486
Everyone got that from a book.

351
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:46,246
OK, you two bad boys.
Behave yourselves.

352
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:49,446
You, Sherl, you're going to have to
tell me where you were last night.

353
00:20:49,447 --> 00:20:52,366
Working. Working? Of course.

354
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:55,526
I'm the only one who really knows
what you're like, remember?

355
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:57,247
Well, don't you go letting on.

356
00:20:58,487 --> 00:20:59,887
I might just, actually.

357
00:21:02,047 --> 00:21:04,046
I haven't told Mary about this.

358
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:07,206
I kind of wanted to surprise her.
Yeah, I think you probably will.

359
00:21:07,207 --> 00:21:09,726
But we should have you two
over for dinner, really soon.

360
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,966
Yeah. My place though,
not the scuzz-dump.

361
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:14,886
Great, yeah.

362
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:16,566
Dinner, yeah.

363
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:20,007
I'd better dash. It was
brilliant to see you. You too.

364
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:26,046
Have a lovely day. Call me later.

365
00:21:26,047 --> 00:21:28,886
I might do. I might call you.

366
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,927
Unless I meet someone prettier.

367
00:21:38,727 --> 00:21:40,727
Solve me a crime, Sherlock Holmes.

368
00:21:46,287 --> 00:21:48,526
You know Magnussen
as a newspaper owner,

369
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:50,246
but he is so much more than that.

370
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:52,806
He uses his power and wealth
to gain information.

371
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:55,846
The more he acquires,
the greater his wealth and power.

372
00:21:55,847 --> 00:22:00,406
And I'm not exaggerating when I say
that he knows the critical pressure
point on every person of note

373
00:22:00,407 --> 00:22:03,886
or influence in the whole of the
Western World and probably beyond.

374
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:06,526
He is the Napoleon of blackmail.

375
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:11,486
And he has created an unassailable
architecture of forbidden knowledge.

376
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:13,446
Its name...

377
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:15,247
is Appledore.

378
00:22:16,527 --> 00:22:18,566
Dinner? Sorry, what dinner?

379
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:21,686
Me and Mary coming for dinner with...

380
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:23,326
wine and...

381
00:22:23,327 --> 00:22:25,526
sitting.

382
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:28,446
Seriously? I have just told you that
the Western World is run

383
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,807
from this house and you want to talk
about dinner? Fine. Talk about the house.

384
00:22:34,447 --> 00:22:37,126
It is the greatest repository
of sensitive and dangerous

385
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:38,846
information anywhere in the world,

386
00:22:38,847 --> 00:22:41,606
the Alexandrian Library
of secrets and scandals

387
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:43,726
and none of it is on a computer.

388
00:22:43,727 --> 00:22:45,646
He's smart. Computers can be hacked.

389
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:48,446
It's all on hard copy, in vaults,
underneath that house.

390
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:51,126
And as long as it is,
the personal freedom of anyone

391
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:53,007
you've ever met is a fantasy.

392
00:22:54,927 --> 00:22:56,926
That was the doorbell.
Couldn't you hear it?

393
00:22:56,927 --> 00:22:59,886
It's in the fridge. It kept ringing.
Oh, that's not a fault, Sherlock!

394
00:22:59,887 --> 00:23:01,607
Who is it?

395
00:23:06,487 --> 00:23:09,047
Mr Holmes said you can go right up.

396
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:19,727
Oh. Go ahead.

397
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:23,486
Sir?

398
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,766
Can I have a moment?

399
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:27,087
He's fine.

400
00:23:29,447 --> 00:23:33,086
Look, I... Right.
I should probably tell you...

401
00:23:33,087 --> 00:23:34,686
OK, I...

402
00:23:34,687 --> 00:23:35,767
There.

403
00:23:42,127 --> 00:23:44,366
Doesn't mean I'm not
pleased to see you.

404
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:46,406
I can vouch for this man.
He is a doctor.

405
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:49,246
If you know who I am,
then you know who he is.

406
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:50,927
Don't you, Mr Magnussen?

407
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:57,166
I understood we were meeting
at YOUR office.

408
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,567
This is my office.

409
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:07,047
Well, it is now.

410
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:14,486
Mr Magnussen, I have been
asked to intercede with you

411
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,566
by Lady Elizabeth Smallwood

412
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:19,366
on the matter
of her husband's letters.

413
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:23,727
Some time ago you put pressure
on her concerning those letters.

414
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:26,847
She would like those letters back.

415
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:32,846
Obviously, the letters no longer
have any practical use to you,

416
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,487
so with that in mind...

417
00:24:36,847 --> 00:24:38,046
Something I said?

418
00:24:38,047 --> 00:24:39,927
No, no. I was reading.

419
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:44,807
There's rather a lot.

420
00:24:47,247 --> 00:24:49,167
Redbeard?

421
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:55,446
Sorry. Sorry, you were
probably talking.

422
00:24:55,447 --> 00:24:57,126
I...

423
00:24:57,127 --> 00:25:01,006
I was trying to explain that I have
been asked to act on behalf of...

424
00:25:01,007 --> 00:25:04,046
Bathroom?
Along from the kitchen, sir.

425
00:25:04,047 --> 00:25:08,086
OK. I've been asked to negotiate
the return of those letters.

426
00:25:08,087 --> 00:25:11,126
I am aware you do not make copies
of sensitive documents.

427
00:25:11,127 --> 00:25:15,526
Is it like the rest of the flat?
Sir? The bathroom?

428
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:18,406
Yes, sir. Maybe not then.

429
00:25:18,407 --> 00:25:21,127
Am I acceptable to you
as an intermediary?

430
00:25:24,327 --> 00:25:27,126
Lady Elizabeth Smallwood...

431
00:25:27,127 --> 00:25:28,527
I like her.

432
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:33,606
Mr Magnussen,
am I acceptable to you

433
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:35,446
as an intermediary?

434
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:37,047
She's English with a spine.

435
00:25:41,047 --> 00:25:44,087
Best thing about the English...

436
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:49,366
you're so domesticated.

437
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:52,527
All standing around, apologising...

438
00:25:53,727 --> 00:25:56,447
keeping your little heads down.

439
00:25:58,127 --> 00:26:02,406
You can do what you like here.
No-one's ever going to stop you.

440
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:04,927
A nation of herbivores.

441
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:09,486
I have interests
all over the world but...

442
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:11,287
everything starts in England.

443
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:14,687
If it works here...

444
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,207
I try it in a real country.

445
00:26:22,487 --> 00:26:24,846
The United Kingdom,

446
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:27,327
Petri dish to the Western World.

447
00:26:28,407 --> 00:26:33,286
Tell Lady Elizabeth I might need
those letters so...

448
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:34,567
I'm keeping them.

449
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:38,846
Goodbye.

450
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,807
Anyway...

451
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:45,007
they're funny.

452
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:52,326
Jesus!

453
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:55,287
Did you notice the one
extraordinary thing he did?

454
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:59,326
There was a moment that
kind of stuck in the mind, yeah.

455
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:01,727
Exactly. When he showed us
the letters.

456
00:27:03,047 --> 00:27:05,366
OK. So, he's brought
the letters to London,

457
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:07,526
so no matter what he says,
he's ready to make a deal.

458
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:11,086
Now, Magnussen only makes a deal once
he's established a person's weaknesses,

459
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,766
the pressure point, he calls it.
So, clearly he believes

460
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:17,686
I'm a drug addict
and no serious threat.

461
00:27:17,687 --> 00:27:21,886
And of course, because he's in
town tonight, the letters will be in
his safe in his London office

462
00:27:21,887 --> 00:27:25,086
while he's out to dinner with the Marketing
Group of GB from seven till ten.

463
00:27:25,087 --> 00:27:27,966
How do you know his schedule? Because
I do. I'll see you tonight.

464
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:30,206
I've got some shopping to do.
What's tonight?

465
00:27:30,207 --> 00:27:31,446
I'll text instructions.

466
00:27:31,447 --> 00:27:35,046
Yeah, I'll text YOU if I'm available.
You are, I checked.

467
00:27:35,047 --> 00:27:37,806
Don't bring a gun.
Why would I bring a gun?

468
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:40,966
Or a knife or a tyre lever. Probably
best not to do any arm-spraining,

469
00:27:40,967 --> 00:27:44,046
but we'll see how the night goes.
Are you just assuming I'm coming along?

470
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:49,007
Time you got out of the house, John.
You've put on 7lbs since you married
and the cycling isn't doing it.

471
00:27:50,007 --> 00:27:54,167
It's actually 4lbs. Mary and I
think seven. See you later.

472
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:10,846
And breaking news now.

473
00:28:10,847 --> 00:28:14,486
John Garvie MP has been arrested
today on charges of corruption.

474
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:16,487
This follows an investigation...

475
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:23,926
Magnussen's office is on the top
floor, just below his private flat.

476
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:26,526
There are 14 layers of security
between us and him,

477
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:29,166
two of which aren't even
legal in this country.

478
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:33,447
Want to know how we're going to
break in? Is that what we're doing?
Of course it's what we're doing.

479
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:36,526
Magnussen's private lift.

480
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:40,086
Goes straight to his penthouse
and office. Only he uses it

481
00:28:40,087 --> 00:28:42,286
and only his keycard calls the lift.

482
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:45,966
If anyone else even tries,
security is automatically informed.

483
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:48,286
Standard keycard for the building.

484
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:50,927
Nicked it yesterday. Only gets us
as far as the canteen.

485
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:55,766
Here we go then. If I was to use
this card on that lift now,

486
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:59,366
what happens?
Well, the alarms would go off

487
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:01,446
and you'd be dragged away
by security. Exactly.

488
00:29:01,447 --> 00:29:05,086
Get taken to a small room somewhere
and your head kicked in.

489
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:07,927
Do we really need so much colour?
It passes the time.

490
00:29:09,607 --> 00:29:10,726
But if I do this...

491
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:13,566
If you press a keycard against
your mobile phone for long enough,

492
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:16,126
it corrupts the magnetic strip.
The card stops working.

493
00:29:16,127 --> 00:29:18,846
It's a common problem. Never put
your keycard with your phone.

494
00:29:18,847 --> 00:29:21,646
What happens if I use the card now?

495
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:23,406
It still doesn't work.

496
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:25,886
But it doesn't read
as the wrong card now.

497
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:27,846
It registers as corrupted.

498
00:29:27,847 --> 00:29:31,966
But if it's corrupted, how
do they know it's not Magnussen?

499
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:35,086
Would they risk dragging him off?
Probably not.

500
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:37,406
So, what do they do?
What do they have to do?

501
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:39,606
Check if it's him or not.

502
00:29:39,607 --> 00:29:42,687
There's a camera at eye height
to the right of the door.

503
00:29:47,207 --> 00:29:50,086
A live picture of the card user
is relayed directly

504
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:52,286
to Magnussen's personal staff
in his office,

505
00:29:52,287 --> 00:29:55,046
the only people trusted
to make a positive ID.

506
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:59,006
At this hour,
almost certainly his PA.

507
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,007
So, how does that help us?

508
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:03,646
Human error.

509
00:30:03,647 --> 00:30:04,767
I've been shopping.

510
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:10,246
Here we go then.

511
00:30:10,247 --> 00:30:13,166
You realise you don't exactly
look like Magnussen?

512
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:15,927
Which in this case is
a considerable advantage.

513
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:28,886
Sherlock, you complete loon.
What are you doing?!
Hang on, was that...?

514
00:30:28,887 --> 00:30:30,446
Hi, Janine.

515
00:30:30,447 --> 00:30:32,566
Go on, let me in.

516
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:35,846
I can't. You know I can't.
Don't be silly.

517
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:37,847
Don't make me do it out here.

518
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:41,246
Not in front of everyone.

519
00:30:41,247 --> 00:30:42,967
Do what in front of everyone?

520
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:02,006
You see, as long as there's people,
there's always a weak spot.
That was Janine.

521
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:04,006
Yes, of course it was.
She's Magnussen's PA.

522
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:08,486
That's the whole point. Did you just
get engaged to break into an office?
Yeah. Stroke of luck meeting her

523
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:12,006
at your wedding. You can take
some of the credit. Jesus!

524
00:31:12,007 --> 00:31:16,567
Sherlock, she loves you.
Yes. Like I said, human error.

525
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:22,286
What are you going to do? Well, not
actually marry her, obviously.

526
00:31:22,287 --> 00:31:25,446
There's only so far you can go.
So, what will you tell her?

527
00:31:25,447 --> 00:31:28,606
Well, I'll tell her that our entire
relationship was a ruse

528
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:31,406
to break into her boss's office.
I imagine she'll want to stop

529
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:34,127
seeing me at that point,
but you're the expert on women.

530
00:31:42,647 --> 00:31:44,126
So, where did she go?

531
00:31:44,127 --> 00:31:46,806
That's a bit rude.
I just proposed to her.

532
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:48,126
Sherlock.

533
00:31:48,127 --> 00:31:50,206
Did she faint?

534
00:31:50,207 --> 00:31:52,046
Do they really do that?!

535
00:31:52,047 --> 00:31:54,086
It's a blow to the head.

536
00:31:54,087 --> 00:31:55,726
She's breathing.

537
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:56,766
Janine?

538
00:31:56,767 --> 00:32:00,006
Another in here.

539
00:32:00,007 --> 00:32:02,246
Security.

540
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:03,487
Does he need help?

541
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:11,086
Ex-con. White supremacist
by the tattoos, so who cares?

542
00:32:11,087 --> 00:32:12,207
Stick with Janine.

543
00:32:13,647 --> 00:32:17,487
Janine, focus on my voice.
Can you hear me?

544
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:28,126
Hey, they must still be here.

545
00:32:28,127 --> 00:32:30,006
So is Magnussen.
His seat's still warm.

546
00:32:30,007 --> 00:32:32,966
He should be at dinner,
but he's still in the building.

547
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:35,886
Upstairs. We should call the police.
During our own burglary?

548
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,846
You're really not a natural
at this, are you?

549
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:40,487
No, wait. Sssh.

550
00:32:42,887 --> 00:32:44,967
Perfume and not Janine's.

551
00:32:46,647 --> 00:32:49,686
Claire de la Lune.
Why do I know it?

552
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:52,927
Mary wears it. No, not Mary.
Somebody else.

553
00:32:55,447 --> 00:32:56,967
Sherlock!

554
00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:08,166
What would your husband think?

555
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:11,406
Your lovely husband,
upright and honourable,

556
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:14,686
so English. What would
he say to you now?

557
00:33:14,687 --> 00:33:16,447
No, no!

558
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:20,606
You're doing this to protect
him from the truth?

559
00:33:20,607 --> 00:33:23,166
Well, is this the protection
he would want?

560
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,286
Additionally, if you're
going to commit murder,

561
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:29,087
you might consider changing
your perfume, Lady Smallwood.

562
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:33,007
Sorry. Who?

563
00:33:37,887 --> 00:33:42,247
That's... not Lady Smallwood,
Mr Holmes.

564
00:33:54,647 --> 00:33:57,286
Is John with you? He's, um...

565
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:58,327
Is John here?

566
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:00,927
He's downstairs.

567
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:06,206
So, what do you do now?

568
00:34:06,207 --> 00:34:07,926
Kill us both?

569
00:34:07,927 --> 00:34:12,486
Mary, whatever he's got on you,
let me help.

570
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:15,846
Oh, Sherlock, if you take one more
step, I swear I will kill you.

571
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:18,326
No, Mrs Watson...

572
00:34:18,327 --> 00:34:19,927
you won't.

573
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:29,366
I'm sorry, Sherlock.

574
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,127
I truly am.

575
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:34,927
Mary?

576
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:43,926
It's not like it is in the movies.

577
00:34:43,927 --> 00:34:48,166
There's not a great big spurt of
blood and you go flying backwards.

578
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:50,886
The impact isn't spread
over a wide area.

579
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:53,726
It's tightly focused so there's
little or no energy transfer.

580
00:34:53,727 --> 00:34:56,646
You stay still
and the bullet pushes through.

581
00:34:56,647 --> 00:35:00,287
You're almost certainly going
to die, so we need to focus.

582
00:35:03,087 --> 00:35:04,887
I said, "Focus!"

583
00:35:07,127 --> 00:35:09,126
It's all well and clever
having a mind palace,

584
00:35:09,127 --> 00:35:11,806
but you've only three seconds
of consciousness left to use it.

585
00:35:11,807 --> 00:35:14,446
So, come on.
What's going to kill you?

586
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:18,286
Blood loss. Exactly.
So, it's all about one thing now -

587
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:20,566
forwards or backwards?

588
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:22,926
We need to decide which way
you're going to fall.

589
00:35:22,927 --> 00:35:26,886
One hole or two? Sorry?
Is the bullet still inside you?

590
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:29,566
Or is there an exit wound?
It'll depend on the gun.

591
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:31,766
That one, I think.

592
00:35:31,767 --> 00:35:33,327
Or that one.

593
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:38,246
Oh, for God's sake, Sherlock.
It doesn't matter about the gun.

594
00:35:38,247 --> 00:35:40,006
Don't be stupid.

595
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:42,366
You always were so stupid.

596
00:35:42,367 --> 00:35:44,526
Such a disappointment.

597
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:46,126
I'm not stupid.

598
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:48,606
You're a very stupid little boy.

599
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:50,806
Mummy and Daddy are very cross

600
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:54,246
because it doesn't matter
about the gun.

601
00:35:54,247 --> 00:35:55,526
Why not?

602
00:35:55,527 --> 00:35:57,726
You saw the whole room
when you entered it.

603
00:35:57,727 --> 00:36:00,326
What was directly behind you
when you were murdered?

604
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:02,566
I've not been murdered YET.

605
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:04,767
Balance of probability,
little brother.

606
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:11,326
If the bullet had passed through
you, what would you have heard?

607
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:12,766
The mirror shattering.

608
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:14,287
You didn't. Therefore...?

609
00:36:15,447 --> 00:36:17,926
The bullet's still inside me.

610
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,966
So we need to take him
down backwards.

611
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:22,926
I agree. Sherlock,
you need to fall on your back.

612
00:36:22,927 --> 00:36:25,166
Right now the bullet is
the cork in a bottle.

613
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:27,726
The bullet itself is blocking
most of the blood flow.

614
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:31,086
But any pressure or impact on the
entrance wound could dislodge it.

615
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:34,606
Plus, on your back, gravity's
working for us.

616
00:36:34,607 --> 00:36:35,926
Fall...

617
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,167
now.

618
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:54,927
What the hell is that?!
What's happening?!

619
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:59,166
You're going into shock. It's the
next thing that's going to kill you.

620
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:02,126
What do I do? Don't go
into shock, obviously.

621
00:37:02,127 --> 00:37:05,286
Must be something in this ridiculous
memory palace of yours

622
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:06,727
that can calm you down.

623
00:37:08,447 --> 00:37:09,487
Find it.

624
00:37:10,767 --> 00:37:13,886
The East Wind is coming, Sherlock.

625
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:15,567
It's coming to get you.

626
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:22,207
Find it.

627
00:37:24,847 --> 00:37:27,126
Hello, Redbeard. Here, boy.

628
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:29,726
Come on. Come to me.

629
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:31,526
It's OK. It's all right.

630
00:37:31,527 --> 00:37:33,566
Come on.
It's me. It's me.

631
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:34,766
Come on.

632
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:36,686
Good boy. Clever boy.

633
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,166
Good boy.

634
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:41,047
Hello, Redbeard. They're putting
me down too now.

635
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,646
It's no fun, is it?

636
00:37:44,647 --> 00:37:46,327
Redbeard.

637
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:55,366
That was shock. You're going
to feel the pain.

638
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:58,606
There's a hole ripped through you.

639
00:37:58,607 --> 00:38:00,806
Massive internal bleeding.

640
00:38:00,807 --> 00:38:03,087
You have to control the pain.

641
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:09,007
Control. Control. Control.

642
00:38:12,087 --> 00:38:13,487
You...

643
00:38:15,287 --> 00:38:17,447
You never felt pain, did you?

644
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:21,246
Why did you never feel pain?

645
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:23,967
You always feel it, Sherlock.

646
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:32,887
But you don't have to fear it!

647
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:41,527
Pain...

648
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:44,687
heartbreak...

649
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:47,447
loss...

650
00:38:49,407 --> 00:38:51,926
death...

651
00:38:51,927 --> 00:38:53,487
it's all good.

652
00:38:55,647 --> 00:38:57,046
It's all good.

653
00:38:57,047 --> 00:39:00,006
Sherlock! Sherlock. Can you hear me?

654
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,486
What happened?

655
00:39:01,487 --> 00:39:02,726
He got shot.

656
00:39:02,727 --> 00:39:03,846
Jesus!

657
00:39:03,847 --> 00:39:05,166
Sherlock.

658
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:06,766
Oh, my!

659
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:07,966
Who shot him?!

660
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:10,206
'Emergency. Which service
do you require?'

661
00:39:10,207 --> 00:39:12,406
? It's raining

662
00:39:12,407 --> 00:39:15,406
? It's pouring

663
00:39:15,407 --> 00:39:20,167
? Sherlock is boring

664
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:23,686
? I'm laughing

665
00:39:23,687 --> 00:39:26,286
? I'm crying

666
00:39:26,287 --> 00:39:30,086
? Sherlock is dying. ?

667
00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:31,807
Sherlock!

668
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:35,047
We're losing you. Sherlock!

669
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:41,047
Come on, Sherlock.
Just die, why can't you?

670
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:44,446
One little push

671
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:45,967
and off you pop.

672
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,687
You're going to love being dead,
Sherlock. No-one ever bothers you.

673
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:03,606
Mrs Hudson will cry...

674
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:05,926
and Mummy and Daddy will cry...

675
00:40:05,927 --> 00:40:10,166
and the woman will cry and John
will cry buckets and buckets.

676
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:14,246
It's him that I worry about
the most. That wife!

677
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:16,486
You're letting him down, Sherlock.

678
00:40:16,487 --> 00:40:19,447
John Watson is definitely in danger.

679
00:40:34,287 --> 00:40:36,326
Oh, you're not getting
better, are you?

680
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:37,967
Was it something I said, huh?

681
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:45,167
Sherlock!

682
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:37,486
Mary. Hey.

683
00:41:37,487 --> 00:41:39,206
He's only bloody woken up.

684
00:41:39,207 --> 00:41:42,566
He's pulled through. Really?
Yeah. Seriously? You...

685
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:45,326
Mrs Watson, you're in big trouble.

686
00:41:45,327 --> 00:41:46,726
Really? Why?

687
00:41:46,727 --> 00:41:48,686
His first word when he woke up...

688
00:41:48,687 --> 00:41:49,927
"Mary."

689
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:10,647
You don't tell him.

690
00:42:12,527 --> 00:42:14,167
Sherlock?

691
00:42:16,127 --> 00:42:17,727
You don't tell John.

692
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,967
Bad girl.

693
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,727
Bad, bad girl.

694
00:42:30,887 --> 00:42:32,167
Look at me...

695
00:42:33,407 --> 00:42:35,687
and tell me you're not
going to tell him.

696
00:42:44,127 --> 00:42:46,007
I'm buying a cottage.

697
00:42:47,127 --> 00:42:49,486
I've made a lot of money
out of you, mister.

698
00:42:49,487 --> 00:42:51,846
Nothing hits the spot
like revenge with profits.

699
00:42:51,847 --> 00:42:54,326
You didn't give those stories
to Magnussen, did you?

700
00:42:54,327 --> 00:42:57,526
God, no. One of his rivals.
He was spitting.

701
00:42:57,527 --> 00:42:59,126
Hmm.

702
00:42:59,127 --> 00:43:01,606
Sherlock Holmes, you are
a back-stabbing, heartless,

703
00:43:01,607 --> 00:43:03,366
manipulative bastard.

704
00:43:03,367 --> 00:43:06,526
And you, as it turns out,
are a grasping, opportunistic,

705
00:43:06,527 --> 00:43:09,006
publicity-hungry, tabloid whore.

706
00:43:09,007 --> 00:43:10,486
So, we're good then?

707
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,526
Yeah, of course.

708
00:43:12,527 --> 00:43:15,286
Where's the cottage? Sussex Downs.

709
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:17,206
Nice. It's gorgeous.

710
00:43:17,207 --> 00:43:19,606
There's beehives,
but I'm getting rid of those.

711
00:43:19,607 --> 00:43:22,926
Oh, it hurts, does it?

712
00:43:22,927 --> 00:43:25,006
Probably want to restart
your morphine.

713
00:43:25,007 --> 00:43:26,646
I might have fiddled with the taps.

714
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:30,166
How much more revenge are you going
to need? Just the occasional top-up.

715
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:32,326
Dream come true for you, this place.

716
00:43:32,327 --> 00:43:34,526
They actually attach
the drugs to you.

717
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,166
Not good for working.

718
00:43:36,167 --> 00:43:38,726
You won't be working
for a while, Sherl.

719
00:43:38,727 --> 00:43:40,646
You lied to me.

720
00:43:40,647 --> 00:43:42,966
You lied and lied.

721
00:43:42,967 --> 00:43:45,766
I exploited the fact
of our connection.

722
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:47,047
When?

723
00:43:48,567 --> 00:43:50,566
Just once would have been nice.

724
00:43:50,567 --> 00:43:52,126
Oh.

725
00:43:52,127 --> 00:43:54,486
I was waiting till we got married.

726
00:43:54,487 --> 00:43:56,607
That was never going to happen.

727
00:43:59,967 --> 00:44:01,367
Got to go.

728
00:44:03,447 --> 00:44:05,526
I'm not supposed
to keep you talking.

729
00:44:05,527 --> 00:44:08,166
And also, I have an interview
with The One Show

730
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:10,567
and I haven't made it up yet.

731
00:44:11,887 --> 00:44:14,286
Just one thing...

732
00:44:14,287 --> 00:44:16,806
you shouldn't have lied to me.

733
00:44:16,807 --> 00:44:19,286
I know what kind of man you are,

734
00:44:19,287 --> 00:44:22,006
but we could have been friends.

735
00:44:22,007 --> 00:44:24,127
I'll give your love
to John and Mary.

736
00:44:42,967 --> 00:44:45,486
You don't tell him.

737
00:44:45,487 --> 00:44:47,846
You don't tell John.

738
00:44:47,847 --> 00:44:49,207
So...

739
00:44:51,047 --> 00:44:53,207
Mary Watson...

740
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:57,687
who are you?

741
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:05,807
Mary Watson.

742
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:16,606
I don't know how much sense
you'll get out of him.

743
00:45:16,607 --> 00:45:18,806
He's drugged up,
so he's pretty much babbling.

744
00:45:18,807 --> 00:45:21,006
Oh, they won't let you use
that in here, you know?

745
00:45:21,007 --> 00:45:24,447
No, I'm not going to use the phone.
I just want to take a video.

746
00:45:30,447 --> 00:45:31,767
Oh, Jesus!

747
00:45:34,287 --> 00:45:35,846
So, where would he go?

748
00:45:35,847 --> 00:45:37,526
Oh, Christ knows!

749
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:40,007
Try finding Sherlock in London.

750
00:45:41,927 --> 00:45:44,326
He's got three known bolt-holes.

751
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:47,326
Parliament Hill, Camden Lock
and Dagmar Court.

752
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,966
Five known bolt holes.

753
00:45:48,967 --> 00:45:51,246
There's the blind greenhouse
in Kew Gardens

754
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:53,326
and the leaning tomb
in Hampstead Cemetery.

755
00:45:53,327 --> 00:45:54,806
Just the spare bedroom.

756
00:45:54,807 --> 00:45:57,086
Well, my bedroom.

757
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,727
We agreed he needs the space.

758
00:46:02,007 --> 00:46:04,486
Behind the clock face of Big Ben.

759
00:46:04,487 --> 00:46:06,126
I think he was probably joking.

760
00:46:06,127 --> 00:46:07,406
No, I don't think so.

761
00:46:07,407 --> 00:46:11,606
Leinster Gardens. It's his number
one bolt hole. Top, top secret.

762
00:46:11,607 --> 00:46:13,846
He only knows about it
cos he stalked him one night.

763
00:46:13,847 --> 00:46:16,726
Followed! Followed, yeah.

764
00:46:16,727 --> 00:46:18,686
He knew who shot him.

765
00:46:18,687 --> 00:46:21,566
The bullet wound was here,
so he was facing whoever it was.

766
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:25,326
So, why not tell us? Because he's
tracking them down himself.

767
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:27,646
Or protecting them.
Protecting the shooter, why?

768
00:46:27,647 --> 00:46:30,126
Well, protecting someone then.
But why would he care?

769
00:46:30,127 --> 00:46:32,887
He's Sherlock. Who would he
bother protecting?

770
00:46:34,247 --> 00:46:37,166
Call me if you hear anything.
Don't hold out on me, John.

771
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:39,486
Call me, OK? Yeah. Yeah, right.

772
00:46:39,487 --> 00:46:42,487
Good night then. Bye then.

773
00:46:45,007 --> 00:46:46,686
John, need a cuppa?

774
00:46:46,687 --> 00:46:50,646
Mrs Hudson, why does Sherlock think
that I'll be moving back in here?

775
00:46:50,647 --> 00:46:53,486
Oh, yes, he's put your chair
back again, hasn't he?

776
00:46:53,487 --> 00:46:56,047
That's nice. It looks much better.

777
00:46:58,807 --> 00:47:01,766
John, what's wrong? Tell me. John?

778
00:47:01,767 --> 00:47:06,086
That's your phone, isn't it?

779
00:47:06,087 --> 00:47:08,526
It's Sherlock, John. Sherlock.

780
00:47:08,527 --> 00:47:11,847
John, you have to answer it!

781
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:19,206
Spare any change, love? No.
Oh, come on, love.

782
00:47:19,207 --> 00:47:20,887
Don't be like all the rest.

783
00:47:24,807 --> 00:47:28,047
Rule one of looking
for Sherlock Holmes, he finds you.

784
00:47:29,127 --> 00:47:31,366
You're working for Sherlock now?

785
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:35,047
Keeps me off the streets,
doesn't it? Well... no.

786
00:47:39,887 --> 00:47:42,326
Where are you?
'Can't you see me?'

787
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:44,286
Well, what am I looking for?

788
00:47:44,287 --> 00:47:48,047
'The lie, the lie of Leinster
Gardens, hidden in plain sight.

789
00:47:50,127 --> 00:47:53,206
'Hardly anyone notices. People live
here for years and never see it.

790

'But if you are what I think
you are, it will take you
less than a minute.

791
00:47:56,567 --> 00:48:00,126
'The houses, Mary.
Look at the houses.'

792
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,206
How did you know I'd come here?

793
00:48:02,207 --> 00:48:06,046
'I knew you'd talk to the people
no-one else would bother with.'

794
00:48:06,047 --> 00:48:08,246
Huh, I thought I was being clever.

795
00:48:08,247 --> 00:48:11,126
'You're always clever,
Mary, I was relying on that.

796
00:48:11,127 --> 00:48:13,566
'I planted the information
for you to find.'

797
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,766
Ohh!

798
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:16,926
'30 seconds.'

799
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,606
But what am I looking at?

800
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:23,086
'No door knobs, no letterbox.
Painted windows.

801
00:48:23,087 --> 00:48:26,246

Huh, it's a dummy.

840
00:50:43,127 --> 00:50:45,167
Well, I suppose that was a fairly
obvious trick.

And yet,
over a distance of six feet,

842
00:50:57,927 --> 00:50:59,887
you failed to make a kill shot.

843
00:51:02,607 --> 00:51:05,527
Enough to hospitalise me,
not enough to kill me.

844
00:51:06,807 --> 00:51:10,927
That wasn't a miss,
that was surgery.

845
00:51:15,167 --> 00:51:17,206
I'll take the case. What case?

846
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:21,806
Yours. Why didn't you come to me
in the first place?

847
00:51:21,807 --> 00:51:25,566
Because John can't ever know that
I lied to him.

848
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,206
It would break him
and I would lose him forever.

849
00:51:28,207 --> 00:51:30,687
And Sherlock, I will never
let that happen.

850
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:35,246
Please, understand,

851
00:51:35,247 --> 00:51:40,326
there is nothing in this world I
would not do to stop that happening.

Sorry.

853
00:51:44,047 --> 00:51:45,767
Not that obvious a trick.

854
00:52:01,007 --> 00:52:04,407
Now talk and sort it out
and do it quickly.

00:52:33,607 --> 00:52:35,366
and you've got potatoes on it!

862
00:52:35,367 --> 00:52:37,886
You shouldn't leave it lying around
if it's so important.

863
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:40,166
Why are we doing this?
We never do this.

864
00:52:40,167 --> 00:52:42,886
We are here because Sherlock
is home from hospital

865
00:52:42,887 --> 00:52:45,046
and we are all very happy.

866
00:52:45,047 --> 00:52:46,686
Am I happy too? I haven't checked.

867
00:52:46,687 --> 00:52:47,926
Behave, Mike!

868
00:52:47,927 --> 00:52:49,606
Mycroft is the name you gave me,

869
00:52:49,607 --> 00:52:53,526
if you could possibly struggle all
the way to the end. Mrs Holmes.

870
00:52:53,527 --> 00:52:57,926
Oh, thank you, dear. I'm not
absolutely sure why you're here.

871
00:52:57,927 --> 00:52:59,326
I invited him.

872
00:52:59,327 --> 00:53:01,046
I'm his protege, Mrs Holmes.

873
00:53:01,047 --> 00:53:04,126
When he dies,
I get all his stuff and his job.

874
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,646
No. Oh, well, I help out a bit.

875
00:53:06,647 --> 00:53:08,726
Closer.

876
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,566
If he does get murdered or
something...

877
00:53:10,567 --> 00:53:12,646
Probably stop talking now. OK.

878
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,766
Lovely when you
bring your friends round!

879
00:53:14,767 --> 00:53:17,926
Stop it, you.
Somebody's put a bullet in my boy.

880
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:22,566
If I ever find out who,
I shall turn absolutely monstrous.

881
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:25,847
This was for Mary.
I'll be back in a minute.

882
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:32,886
Ah. Mary. There you are.

883
00:53:32,887 --> 00:53:36,246
Cup of tea. If Father starts
making little humming noises,

884
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:39,326
just give him a little poke.
That usually does it.

885
00:53:39,327 --> 00:53:41,406
Did you write this?

886
00:53:41,407 --> 00:53:43,526
Oh, that silly old thing,
you mustn't read that.

887
00:53:43,527 --> 00:53:46,686
Mathematics must seem terribly
fatuous now.

888
00:53:46,687 --> 00:53:48,767
No humming, you.

889
00:53:51,367 --> 00:53:54,406
Complete flake, my wife, but happens
to be a genius.

890
00:53:54,407 --> 00:53:55,966
She was a mathematician?

891
00:53:55,967 --> 00:54:01,606
Gave it all up for children. I could
never bear to argue with her.

892
00:54:01,607 --> 00:54:04,326
I'm something of a moron myself.

893
00:54:04,327 --> 00:54:08,086
But she's... unbelievably hot.

894
00:54:08,087 --> 00:54:12,087
Oh my God, you're the sane one,
aren't you?

895
00:54:13,047 --> 00:54:14,367
Aren't you?

896
00:54:17,807 --> 00:54:21,007
Oh. Sorry, I just, er...

897
00:54:22,887 --> 00:54:25,366
Oh, you two need a moment?

898
00:54:25,367 --> 00:54:27,246
If you don't mind?

899
00:54:27,247 --> 00:54:31,206
No, course not. I'll go and see if
I can help with...

900
00:54:31,207 --> 00:54:32,687
something or another.

901
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:44,126
Those two. They all right?

902
00:54:44,127 --> 00:54:47,487
Well, you know,
they've had their ups and downs.

903
00:54:51,887 --> 00:54:53,447
Baker Street, now.

904
00:55:04,687 --> 00:55:08,167
John, Mary...

905
00:55:10,767 --> 00:55:14,086
Oh, Sherlock, oh, good gracious,
you look terrible!

906
00:55:14,087 --> 00:55:16,486
Get me some morphine
from your kitchen, I've run out.

907
00:55:16,487 --> 00:55:20,126
I don't have any morphine. Then what
exactly is the point of you?!

908
00:55:20,127 --> 00:55:21,646
What is going on?

909
00:55:21,647 --> 00:55:22,966
Bloody good question.

910
00:55:22,967 --> 00:55:26,966
The Watsons are about to have a
domestic and fairly quickly I hope,
because we've got work to do.

911
00:55:26,967 --> 00:55:28,326
No, I have a better question -

912
00:55:28,327 --> 00:55:32,407
is everyone I have ever met
a psychopath?

913
00:55:33,527 --> 00:55:34,926
Yes.

914
00:55:34,927 --> 00:55:37,687
Good that we've settled that.
Now we... SHUT UP!

915
00:55:38,927 --> 00:55:42,646
And stay shut up,
because this is not funny.

916
00:55:42,647 --> 00:55:43,686
Not this time.

917
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:46,526
I didn't say it was funny. You.

918
00:55:46,527 --> 00:55:49,247
What have I ever done? Hmm?

919
00:55:50,487 --> 00:55:53,046
My whole life, to deserve you?

920
00:55:53,047 --> 00:55:54,606
Everything.

921
00:55:54,607 --> 00:55:57,286
Sherlock, I've told you, shut up.

922
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:59,326
No, I mean it -
seriously, everything.

923
00:55:59,327 --> 00:56:01,646
Everything you've ever done,
is what you did.

924
00:56:01,647 --> 00:56:04,046
Sherlock, one more word
and you will not need morphine.

925
00:56:04,047 --> 00:56:06,046
You were a doctor who went to war.

926
00:56:06,047 --> 00:56:08,926
You're a man who couldn't stay in
the suburbs for more than a month

927
00:56:08,927 --> 00:56:11,326
without storming a crack den,
beating up a junkie.

928
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:13,846
Your best friend is a
sociopath, who solves crimes

929
00:56:13,847 --> 00:56:17,486
as an alternative to getting high.
That's me, by the way, hello.

930
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:19,406
Even the landlady used to
run a drug cartel.

931
00:56:19,407 --> 00:56:22,406
It was my husband's cartel.
I was just typing.

932
00:56:22,407 --> 00:56:24,046
And exotic dancing.

933
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,446
Sherlock Holmes,
if you've been YouTubing...

934
00:56:26,447 --> 00:56:30,206
John, you are addicted to
a certain lifestyle.

935
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:34,526
You are abnormally attracted to
dangerous situations and people,

936
00:56:34,527 --> 00:56:39,406
so is it truly such a surprise
that the woman you fall in love with

937
00:56:39,407 --> 00:56:41,046
conforms to that pattern?

938
00:56:41,047 --> 00:56:43,447
But she wasn't supposed to
be like that!

939
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:49,047
Why is SHE like that?

940
00:56:51,647 --> 00:56:53,567
Because you chose her.

941
00:56:59,087 --> 00:57:01,846
Why is everything always

942
00:57:01,847 --> 00:57:04,006
MY FAULT?!

943
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:05,926
Oh, neighbours!

944
00:57:05,927 --> 00:57:08,526
John, listen. Be calm and answer me.

945
00:57:08,527 --> 00:57:10,486
What is she?

946
00:57:10,487 --> 00:57:12,726
My lying wife? No, what is she?

947
00:57:12,727 --> 00:57:16,246
And the woman who is carrying
my child, who has lied to me
since the day I met her.

948
00:57:16,247 --> 00:57:19,606
No. Not in this flat,
not in this room.

949
00:57:19,607 --> 00:57:23,327
Right here, right now, what is she?

950
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:27,367
OK.

951
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:32,687
Your way.

952
00:57:34,567 --> 00:57:35,887
Always your way.

953
00:57:42,727 --> 00:57:44,086
Sit.

954
00:57:44,087 --> 00:57:45,446
Why?

955
00:57:45,447 --> 00:57:47,527
Because that's where they sit.

956
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:51,606
The people who come in here
with their stories.

957
00:57:51,607 --> 00:57:53,966
They're the clients,
that's all you are now, Mary.

958
00:57:53,967 --> 00:57:55,007
You're a client.

959
00:57:56,247 --> 00:57:59,606
This is where you sit and talk
and this is where we sit and listen.

960
00:57:59,607 --> 00:58:01,567
Then we decide
if we want you or not.

961
00:58:32,527 --> 00:58:34,406
So, are you OK?

962
00:58:34,407 --> 00:58:39,407
Oh, are we doing conversation today?
It really is Christmas!

963
00:58:43,527 --> 00:58:45,566
Now?

964
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:49,967
Seriously, months of silence
and we're going to do this now?

965
00:58:57,687 --> 00:59:00,247
A.G.R.A., what's that?

966
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:04,407
Er... my initials.

967
00:59:07,447 --> 00:59:10,526
Everything about who
I was is on there.

968
00:59:10,527 --> 00:59:12,886
If you love me,
don't read it in front of me.

969
00:59:12,887 --> 00:59:14,806
Why?

970
00:59:14,807 --> 00:59:18,006
Because you won't love me
when you've finished

971
00:59:18,007 --> 00:59:20,807
and I don't want to see that happen.

972
00:59:28,447 --> 00:59:29,886
How much do you know already?

973
00:59:29,887 --> 00:59:34,206
By your skill set, you are, or were,
an intelligence agent.

974
00:59:34,207 --> 00:59:37,246
Your accent is currently English,
but I suspect you are not.

975
00:59:37,247 --> 00:59:38,806
You're on the run from something.

976
00:59:38,807 --> 00:59:41,046
You've used your skills
to disappear.

977
00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:43,966
Magnussen knows your secret, which
is why you were going to kill him.

978
00:59:43,967 --> 00:59:46,846
And I assume you befriended
Janine in order to get close to him.

979
00:59:46,847 --> 00:59:49,126
Oh, you can talk!

980
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:52,446
Oh, look at you two,
you should have got married.

981
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,806
The stuff Magnussen has on me,

982
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:55,606
I would go to prison for the rest of
my life.

983
00:59:55,607 --> 00:59:58,686
So you were going to kill him? People
like Magnussen should be killed,

984
00:59:58,687 --> 01:00:01,126
that's why there are people like me.
Perfect!

985
01:00:01,127 --> 01:00:04,206
So that's what you were, an assassin?
How could I not see that?

986
01:00:04,207 --> 01:00:05,447
You did see that.

987
01:00:08,527 --> 01:00:09,647
And you married me.

988
01:00:11,967 --> 01:00:13,127
Because he's right.

989
01:00:15,127 --> 01:00:16,807
It's what you like.

990
01:00:21,727 --> 01:00:26,046
So, Mary, any documents that
Magnussen has

991
01:00:26,047 --> 01:00:30,327
concerning yourself,
you want extracted and returned.

992
01:00:31,447 --> 01:00:33,366
Why would you help me?

993
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:34,646
Because you saved my life.

994
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:36,966
Sorry-sorry, what?

995
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:39,247
When I happened on you
and Magnussen...

996
01:00:41,247 --> 01:00:42,487
you had a problem.

997
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:45,967
More specifically,
you had a witness.

998
01:00:49,447 --> 01:00:50,687
What do you do now?

999
01:00:54,207 --> 01:00:55,807
Kill both of us?

1000
01:00:58,207 --> 01:01:01,567
'The solution, of course, was
simple. Kill us both and leave.'

1001
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:15,767
However,
sentiment got the better of you.

1002
01:01:18,727 --> 01:01:21,686
'One precisely calculated shot
to incapacitate me,

1003
01:01:21,687 --> 01:01:25,806
'in the hope that it would buy you
more time to negotiate my silence.'

1004
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,486
Of course,
you couldn't shoot Magnussen.

1005
01:01:28,487 --> 01:01:30,606
On the night both of us
broke into the building,

1006
01:01:30,607 --> 01:01:33,287
your own husband would
become a suspect. So...

1007
01:01:37,367 --> 01:01:43,006
'You calculated that Magnussen would
use the fact of your involvement...'

1008
01:01:43,007 --> 01:01:47,527
rather than sharing the information
with the police, as is his MO.

1009
01:01:49,927 --> 01:01:54,646
And then you left the way you came.

1010
01:01:54,647 --> 01:01:56,126
Have I missed anything?

1011
01:01:56,127 --> 01:01:57,726
How did she save your life?

1012
01:01:57,727 --> 01:02:00,006
She phoned the ambulance.
I phoned the ambulance.

1013
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,527
She phoned first.

1014
01:02:04,967 --> 01:02:06,886
'Emergency,
which service do you require?'

1015
01:02:06,887 --> 01:02:08,966
You didn't find me
for another five minutes.

1016
01:02:08,967 --> 01:02:10,406
Left to you, I would have died.

1017
01:02:10,407 --> 01:02:13,566
The average arrival
time for a London ambulance is...

1018
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:15,686
Did somebody call an ambulance?

1019
01:02:15,687 --> 01:02:18,686
Eight minutes. Did you bring any
morphine? I asked on the phone.

1020
01:02:18,687 --> 01:02:20,326
We were told there was a shooting.

1021
01:02:20,327 --> 01:02:22,046
There was, last week.

1022
01:02:22,047 --> 01:02:23,766
But I believe I'm bleeding
internally,

1023
01:02:23,767 --> 01:02:26,926
my pulse is very erratic, you may
need to restart my heart on the way...

1024
01:02:26,927 --> 01:02:29,566
Jesus, Sherlock. Come on, Sherlock.
Argh!

1025
01:02:29,567 --> 01:02:34,166
John, John,
Magnussen is all that matters now.

1026
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:37,646
You can trust Mary -
she saved my life.

1027
01:02:37,647 --> 01:02:39,246
She shot you.

1028
01:02:39,247 --> 01:02:42,806
Mixed messages, I grant you that...
Argh!

1029
01:02:42,807 --> 01:02:44,966
Sherlock! Sherlock! Take him.

1030
01:02:44,967 --> 01:02:46,207
Got him? Yeah.

1031
01:03:00,207 --> 01:03:01,367
So, have you read it?

1032
01:03:06,767 --> 01:03:09,246
Would you come here a moment?
No, tell me, have you?

1033
01:03:09,247 --> 01:03:11,327
Just... Come here.

1034
01:03:14,727 --> 01:03:16,327
No, I'm fine.

1035
01:03:21,567 --> 01:03:24,807
I've thought long and hard
about what I want to say to you.

1036
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:29,246
These are prepared words, Mary.

1037
01:03:29,247 --> 01:03:31,887
I've chosen these words with care.
OK.

1038
01:03:33,287 --> 01:03:37,407
The problems of your past
are your business.

1039
01:03:39,367 --> 01:03:42,806
The problems of your future...

1040
01:03:42,807 --> 01:03:43,927
are my privilege.

1041
01:03:45,527 --> 01:03:47,447
It's all I have to say,
it's all I need to know.

1042
01:03:56,527 --> 01:03:57,927
No, I didn't read it.

1043
01:04:01,527 --> 01:04:03,207
You don't even know my name.

1044
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:06,686
Is "Mary Watson" good enough for you?

1045
01:04:06,687 --> 01:04:09,486
Yes. Oh my God, yes.

1046
01:04:09,487 --> 01:04:11,327
Then it's good enough for me, too.

1047
01:04:16,247 --> 01:04:19,566
All this does not mean that I'm not
still basically pissed off with you.

1048
01:04:19,567 --> 01:04:20,966
Hmm, I know, I know.

1049
01:04:20,967 --> 01:04:23,966
I am very pissed off,
and it will come out now and then.

1050
01:04:23,967 --> 01:04:25,207
I know, I know, I know.

1051
01:04:27,327 --> 01:04:29,606
You can mow the sodding
lawn from now on.

1052
01:04:29,607 --> 01:04:31,406
I do mow the lawn. I do it loads.

1053
01:04:31,407 --> 01:04:32,646
You really don't.

1054
01:04:32,647 --> 01:04:35,047
I choose the baby's name.
Not a chance. OK.

1055
01:04:37,527 --> 01:04:40,086
I'm glad you've given up on the
Magnussen business. Are you?

1056
01:04:40,087 --> 01:04:43,686
I'm still curious, though. He's
hardly your usual kind of puzzle.

1057
01:04:43,687 --> 01:04:45,166
Why do you hate him?

1058
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:47,206
Because he attacks people
who are different

1059
01:04:47,207 --> 01:04:49,806
and preys on their secrets.
Why don't you?

1060
01:04:49,807 --> 01:04:52,486
He never causes too much damage
to anyone important.

1061
01:04:52,487 --> 01:04:54,406
He's far too intelligent for that.

1062
01:04:54,407 --> 01:04:58,806
He's a businessman, that's all.
And occasionally useful to us.

1063
01:04:58,807 --> 01:05:01,887
A necessary evil,
not a dragon for you to slay.

1064
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:06,446
A dragon-slayer.
Is that what you think of me?

1065
01:05:06,447 --> 01:05:09,646
No. It's what you think of yourself.

1066
01:05:09,647 --> 01:05:11,046
Are you two smoking?!

1067
01:05:11,047 --> 01:05:12,407
No. It was Mycroft.

1068
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:22,166
I have, by the way, a job offer
I should like you to decline.

1069
01:05:22,167 --> 01:05:24,206
I decline your kind offer.

1070
01:05:24,207 --> 01:05:25,606
I shall pass on your regrets.

1071
01:05:25,607 --> 01:05:30,286
What was it? MI6. They want to
place you back into Eastern Europe.

1072
01:05:30,287 --> 01:05:33,686
An undercover assignment
that would prove fatal to you in,

1073
01:05:33,687 --> 01:05:36,486
I think, about six months.

1074
01:05:36,487 --> 01:05:39,006
Then why don't you want me
to take it?

1075
01:05:39,007 --> 01:05:43,166
It's tempting, but on balance, you
have more utility closer to home.

1076
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,447
Utility! How do I have utility?

1077
01:05:47,647 --> 01:05:48,687
Here be dragons.

1078
01:05:50,767 --> 01:05:53,566
This isn't agreeing with me.

1079
01:05:53,567 --> 01:05:54,886
I'm going in.

1080
01:05:54,887 --> 01:05:58,447
You need low tar.
You still smoke like a beginner.

1081
01:06:00,647 --> 01:06:01,687
Also...

1082
01:06:03,447 --> 01:06:05,247
your loss would break my heart.

1083
01:06:06,887 --> 01:06:09,287
What the hell am
I supposed to say to that?!

1084
01:06:12,247 --> 01:06:14,326
Merry Christmas? You hate Christmas.

1085
01:06:14,327 --> 01:06:18,086
Yes. Perhaps there was
something in the punch.

1086
01:06:18,087 --> 01:06:20,087
Clearly. Go and have some more.

1087
01:06:23,567 --> 01:06:27,286
So you realise that Sherlock got us out
here to see his mum and dad for a reason?

1088
01:06:27,287 --> 01:06:31,606
His lovely mum and dad, a fine
example of married life, I get that.

1089
01:06:31,607 --> 01:06:35,166
That is the thing with Sherlock,
it's always the unexpected.

1090
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:38,486
Oi. Oi? Mary?

1091
01:06:38,487 --> 01:06:41,566
Jesus Christ! Mary? Sit down.

1092
01:06:41,567 --> 01:06:42,807
Mary, can you hear me?

1093
01:06:43,927 --> 01:06:45,327
Don't drink Mary's tea.

1094
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:50,087
Or the punch.

1095
01:06:55,647 --> 01:06:56,687
Sherlock...

1096
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,806
Did you just drug my pregnant wife?!

1097
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:02,166
Don't worry,
Wiggins is an excellent chemist.

1098
01:07:02,167 --> 01:07:05,526
I calculated your wife's dose
myself. Won't affect the little one.

1099
01:07:05,527 --> 01:07:06,646
I'll keep an eye on her.

1100
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:09,686
He'll monitor their recovery.
It's more or less his day job.

1101
01:07:09,687 --> 01:07:10,967
What the hell have you done?!

1102
01:07:11,967 --> 01:07:14,007
A deal with the devil.

1103
01:07:22,327 --> 01:07:24,166
Shouldn't you be in hospital?

1104
01:07:24,167 --> 01:07:27,766
I am in hospital.
This is the canteen.

1105
01:07:27,767 --> 01:07:31,086
Is it? In my opinion, yes.
Have a seat.

1106
01:07:31,087 --> 01:07:32,127
Thank you.

1107
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:36,326
I've been thinking about you.

1108
01:07:36,327 --> 01:07:38,486
I've been thinking about you.

1109
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:39,927
Really?

1110
01:07:44,287 --> 01:07:45,727
I want to see Appledore.

1111
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:50,126
Where you keep all the secrets,
all the files,

1112
01:07:50,127 --> 01:07:52,406
everything you've got on everyone.

1113
01:07:52,407 --> 01:07:55,127
I want you to invite me.

1114
01:07:57,487 --> 01:07:59,767
What makes you think
I'd be so careless?

1115
01:08:01,007 --> 01:08:04,767
Oh, I think you're a lot more
careless than you let on.

1116
01:08:07,367 --> 01:08:08,487
Am I?

1117
01:08:13,287 --> 01:08:15,847
It's the dead-eyed stare
that gives it away.

1118
01:08:17,487 --> 01:08:20,687
Except it's not dead-eyed, is it?

1119
01:08:26,047 --> 01:08:27,327
You're reading.

1120
01:08:30,647 --> 01:08:34,927
Portable Appledore.
How does it work?

1121
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:40,887
Built-in flash drive? 4G wireless?

1122
01:08:55,407 --> 01:08:58,126
They're just ordinary spectacles.

1123
01:08:58,127 --> 01:09:00,887
Yes, they are.

1124
01:09:12,087 --> 01:09:14,007
You underestimate me, Mr Holmes.

1125
01:09:24,087 --> 01:09:26,887
Impress me, then. Show me Appledore.

1126
01:09:28,327 --> 01:09:30,486
Everything is available for a price.

1127
01:09:30,487 --> 01:09:32,246
Are you making me an offer?

1128
01:09:32,247 --> 01:09:33,487
A Christmas present.

1129
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:38,486
And what are you giving me
for Christmas, Mr Holmes?

1130
01:09:38,487 --> 01:09:39,847
My brother.

1131
01:09:44,367 --> 01:09:45,407
Oh, Jesus!

1132
01:09:49,527 --> 01:09:53,966
Sherlock, please tell me you haven't
just gone out of your mind.

1133
01:09:53,967 --> 01:09:55,407
I'd rather keep you guessing.

1134
01:09:57,247 --> 01:09:59,687
Ah, there's our lift.

1135
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,806
Coming?

1136
01:10:06,807 --> 01:10:08,286
Where?

1137
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:10,206
You want your wife to be safe?
Of course I do.

1138
01:10:10,207 --> 01:10:12,606
Good, because this is going to be
incredibly dangerous.

1139
01:10:12,607 --> 01:10:16,366
One false move and we'll have
betrayed the security of the United
Kingdom and be in prison

1140
01:10:16,367 --> 01:10:19,686
for high treason. Magnussen is the most
dangerous man we've ever encountered

1141
01:10:19,687 --> 01:10:22,366
and the odds are
comprehensively stacked against us.

1142
01:10:22,367 --> 01:10:24,766
But it's Christmas! I feel the same.

1143
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:28,006
Oh, you mean it's actually Christmas.
Did you bring your gun, as I suggested?

1144
01:10:28,007 --> 01:10:31,926
Why would I bring my gun to your
parents' house for Christmas dinner?!
Is it in your coat? Yes.

1145
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:34,447
Off we go, then. Where are we going?
Appledore.

1146
01:11:31,127 --> 01:11:34,487
I would offer you a drink,
but it's very rare and expensive.

1147
01:11:40,527 --> 01:11:42,766
Oh, it WAS you.

1148
01:11:42,767 --> 01:11:44,526
Yes, of course.

1149
01:11:44,527 --> 01:11:48,126
Very hard to find a pressure
point on you, Mr Holmes.

1150
01:11:48,127 --> 01:11:51,046
The drugs thing
I never believed for a moment.

1151
01:11:51,047 --> 01:11:55,326
Anyway, you wouldn't care
if it was exposed, would you?

1152
01:11:55,327 --> 01:11:58,447
But look how you
care about John Watson.

1153
01:12:00,447 --> 01:12:01,887
Your damsel in distress.

1154
01:12:03,407 --> 01:12:08,206
You put me in a fire, for leverage?!

1155
01:12:08,207 --> 01:12:10,966
Oh, I would never let you burn,
Dr Watson.

1156
01:12:10,967 --> 01:12:15,407
I had people standing by.
I'm not a murderer.

1157
01:12:17,327 --> 01:12:18,887
Unlike your wife.

1158
01:12:24,367 --> 01:12:28,687
Let me explain how leverage works,
Dr Watson.

1159
01:12:30,127 --> 01:12:32,486
For those who understand
these things,

1160
01:12:32,487 --> 01:12:36,446
Mycroft Holmes is the most powerful
man in the country.

1161
01:12:36,447 --> 01:12:38,647
Well, apart from me.

1162
01:12:40,127 --> 01:12:44,766
Mycroft's pressure point is his
junkie detective brother, Sherlock.

1163
01:12:44,767 --> 01:12:47,726
Sherlock's pressure point
is his best friend, John Watson.

1164
01:12:47,727 --> 01:12:50,606
John Watson's pressure
point is his wife.

1165
01:12:50,607 --> 01:12:53,847
I own John Watson's wife,
I own Mycroft.

1166
01:12:55,567 --> 01:12:57,727
He's what I'm getting for Christmas.

1167
01:12:59,207 --> 01:13:00,847
It's an exchange, not a gift.

1168
01:13:05,127 --> 01:13:06,247
Forgive me, but...

1169
01:13:08,567 --> 01:13:10,606
I already seem to have it.

1170
01:13:10,607 --> 01:13:12,127
It's password protected.

1171
01:13:15,327 --> 01:13:18,526
In return for the password,
you will give me any material

1172
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:21,646
in your possession pertaining to the
woman I know as Mary Watson.

1173
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:26,686
Oh, she's bad, that one.
So many dead people.

1174
01:13:26,687 --> 01:13:29,326
You should see what I've seen.
I don't need to see it.

1175
01:13:29,327 --> 01:13:33,087
You might enjoy it, though.
I enjoy it.

1176
01:13:35,207 --> 01:13:37,206
Then why don't you show us?

1177
01:13:37,207 --> 01:13:39,727
Show you Appledore?
The secret vaults.

1178
01:13:40,847 --> 01:13:42,366
Is that what you want?

1179
01:13:42,367 --> 01:13:46,687
I want everything you've
got on Mary.

1180
01:13:54,927 --> 01:13:59,086
You know, I honestly expected
something good.

1181
01:13:59,087 --> 01:14:03,726
Oh, I think you'll find
the contents of that laptop...
Include a GPS locator.

1182
01:14:03,727 --> 01:14:06,646
By now your brother will
have noticed the theft

1183
01:14:06,647 --> 01:14:10,526
and the security services will be
converging on this house.

1184
01:14:10,527 --> 01:14:14,446
Having arrived, they'll find
top-secret information in my hands

1185
01:14:14,447 --> 01:14:18,086
and they have every justification
to search my vaults.

1186
01:14:18,087 --> 01:14:20,686
They will discover further
information of this kind

1187
01:14:20,687 --> 01:14:22,606
and I will be imprisoned.

1188
01:14:22,607 --> 01:14:27,166
You would be exonerated and restored
to your smelly little apartment

1189
01:14:27,167 --> 01:14:29,927
to solve crimes with
Mr and Mrs Psychopath.

1190
01:14:31,927 --> 01:14:35,487
Mycroft has been looking for this
opportunity for a long time.

1191
01:14:37,567 --> 01:14:40,327
He'll be a very, very proud
big brother.

1192
01:14:41,847 --> 01:14:44,766
The fact that you know it's going to
happen isn't going to stop it.

1193
01:14:44,767 --> 01:14:49,567
Then why am I smiling? Ask me.

1194
01:14:50,927 --> 01:14:52,447
Why are you smiling?

1195
01:14:53,967 --> 01:14:57,446
Because Sherlock Holmes has made
one enormous mistake,

1196
01:14:57,447 --> 01:15:00,847
which will destroy
the lives of everyone he loves.

1197
01:15:02,767 --> 01:15:04,527
And everything he holds dear.

1198
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:12,127
Let me show you
the Appledore vaults.

1199
01:15:23,967 --> 01:15:26,207
The entrance to my vaults.

1200
01:15:27,207 --> 01:15:29,087
This is where I keep you all.

1201
01:15:42,767 --> 01:15:45,006
OK, so where are the vaults, then?

1202
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:50,087
Vaults? What vaults? There are no
vaults beneath this building.

1203
01:15:52,927 --> 01:15:54,527
They're all in here.

1204
01:15:56,527 --> 01:15:59,967
The Appledore vaults
are my mind palace.

1205
01:16:01,007 --> 01:16:03,526
You know about mind palaces,
don't you, Sherlock?

1206
01:16:03,527 --> 01:16:08,606
How to store information so you
never forget it, by picturing it.

1207
01:16:08,607 --> 01:16:15,327
I just sit here, I close my eyes
and down I go to my vaults.

1208
01:16:19,687 --> 01:16:22,007
I can go anywhere inside my vaults.

1209
01:16:23,607 --> 01:16:24,967
My memories.

1210
01:16:31,447 --> 01:16:34,247
I'll look at the files
on Mrs Watson.

1211
01:16:42,687 --> 01:16:43,807
Hmm.

1212
01:16:45,327 --> 01:16:48,246
Oh, this is one of my favourites.

1213
01:16:48,247 --> 01:16:50,447
Oh, it's so exciting.

1214
01:16:53,767 --> 01:16:56,526
All those wet jobs for the CIA.

1215
01:16:56,527 --> 01:17:02,127
Ooh, she's gone a bit freelance now,
bad girl.

1216
01:17:10,327 --> 01:17:13,366
Oh, she's so wicked.

1217
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:15,767
I can really see why you like her.

1218
01:17:21,247 --> 01:17:22,846
You see?

1219
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:27,046
So there are no documents, you don't
actually have anything here?

1220
01:17:27,047 --> 01:17:28,846
Oh, sometimes
I send out for something,

1221
01:17:28,847 --> 01:17:32,566
if I really need it,
but mostly I just remember it all.

1222
01:17:32,567 --> 01:17:33,686
I don't understand.

1223
01:17:33,687 --> 01:17:36,526
You should have that on a T-shirt.
You just remember it all?

1224
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:41,326
It's all about knowledge,
everything is. Knowing is owning.

1225
01:17:41,327 --> 01:17:43,486
But if you just know it,
then you don't have proof.

1226
01:17:43,487 --> 01:17:46,206
Proof? What would I need proof for?

1227
01:17:46,207 --> 01:17:48,326
I'm in news, you moron.

1228
01:17:48,327 --> 01:17:51,406
I don't have to prove it,
I just have to print it.

1229
01:17:51,407 --> 01:17:53,326
Speaking of news...

1230
01:17:53,327 --> 01:17:56,206
You'll both be heavily
featured tomorrow.

1231
01:17:56,207 --> 01:17:58,567
Trying to sell state secrets to me.

1232
01:17:59,567 --> 01:18:00,607
Tut tut.

1233
01:18:02,127 --> 01:18:05,766
Let's go outside.
They'll be here shortly.

1234
01:18:05,767 --> 01:18:07,567
Can't wait to see you arrested.

1235
01:18:09,247 --> 01:18:11,647
Sherlock, do we have a plan?

1236
01:18:12,927 --> 01:18:14,247
Sherlock?

1237
01:18:26,647 --> 01:18:29,686
They're taking their time,
aren't they?

1238
01:18:29,687 --> 01:18:31,126
I still don't understand.

1239
01:18:31,127 --> 01:18:33,286
And there's the back of the T-shirt.

1240
01:18:33,287 --> 01:18:36,606
You just know things -
how does that work?

1241
01:18:36,607 --> 01:18:40,206
I just love your little soldier
face. I'd like to punch it.

1242
01:18:40,207 --> 01:18:42,566
Bring it over here a minute.

1243
01:18:42,567 --> 01:18:46,287
Come on. For Mary.
Bring me your face.

1244
01:18:53,247 --> 01:18:55,647
Lean forward a bit
and stick your face out.

1245
01:18:57,887 --> 01:19:00,686
Please.

1246
01:19:00,687 --> 01:19:03,766
Now, can I flick it?

1247
01:19:03,767 --> 01:19:08,687
Look at me. Can I flick your face?

1248
01:19:16,007 --> 01:19:21,006
I just love doing this.
I could do it all day.

1249
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:23,286
Well, it works like this, John.

1250
01:19:23,287 --> 01:19:25,447
I know who Mary hurt and killed.

1251
01:19:26,927 --> 01:19:29,447
I know where to find
people who hate her.

1252
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,927
I know where they live,
I know their phone numbers.

1253
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:41,086
All in my mind palace, all of it.

1254
01:19:41,087 --> 01:19:46,487
I could phone them right now
and tear your whole life down...

1255
01:19:47,567 --> 01:19:49,686
and I will,

1256
01:19:49,687 --> 01:19:53,087
unless you let me flick your face.

1257
01:20:00,647 --> 01:20:02,167
This is what I do to people.

1258
01:20:03,167 --> 01:20:05,247
This is what I do to
whole countries.

1259
01:20:06,687 --> 01:20:09,007
Just because I know.

1260
01:20:10,967 --> 01:20:12,127
Can I do your eye now?

1261
01:20:13,407 --> 01:20:15,207
See if you can keep it open, hmm?

1262
01:20:16,407 --> 01:20:18,366
Come on, for Mary. Keep it open.

1263
01:20:18,367 --> 01:20:19,686
Sherlock?

1264
01:20:19,687 --> 01:20:22,687
Let him. I'm sorry, just... let him.

1265
01:20:24,327 --> 01:20:26,047
Hmm? Come on, eye open.

1266
01:20:30,927 --> 01:20:33,246
It's difficult, isn't it?

1267
01:20:33,247 --> 01:20:37,767
Janine managed to once.
She makes the funniest noises.

1268
01:20:47,207 --> 01:20:50,806
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,
stand away from that man.

1269
01:20:50,807 --> 01:20:52,966
Here we go, Mr Holmes.

1270
01:20:52,967 --> 01:20:57,206
To clarify, Appledore's vaults only
exist in your mind,

1271
01:20:57,207 --> 01:20:59,366
nowhere else, just there?

1272
01:20:59,367 --> 01:21:01,606
They're not real,
they never have been.

1273
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:06,006
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,
step away!

1274
01:21:06,007 --> 01:21:08,926
It's fine, they're harmless.

1275
01:21:08,927 --> 01:21:11,606
'Target is not armed,
I repeat target is not armed.'

1276
01:21:11,607 --> 01:21:12,886
Sherlock, what do we do?

1277
01:21:12,887 --> 01:21:15,966
Nothing. There is
nothing to be done.

1278
01:21:15,967 --> 01:21:19,806
Oh, I'm not a villain,
I have no evil plan.

1279
01:21:19,807 --> 01:21:24,526
I'm a businessman, acquiring assets.
You happen to be one of them.

1280
01:21:24,527 --> 01:21:28,446
Sorry, no chance for you to be
a hero this time, Mr Holmes.

1281
01:21:28,447 --> 01:21:34,006
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,
stand away from that man. Do it now!

1282
01:21:34,007 --> 01:21:36,127
Oh, do your research.

1283
01:21:37,207 --> 01:21:41,286
I'm not a hero,
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.

1284
01:21:41,287 --> 01:21:43,247
Merry Christmas!

1285
01:21:44,327 --> 01:21:46,406
'Man down, man down.'

1286
01:21:46,407 --> 01:21:48,526
Get away from me,
John! Stay well back!

1287
01:21:48,527 --> 01:21:50,526
Christ, Sherlock!

1288
01:21:50,527 --> 01:21:53,686
Don't fire! Do not
fire on Sherlock Holmes!

1289
01:21:53,687 --> 01:21:55,687
Do not fire!

1290
01:21:57,327 --> 01:21:58,567
Oh Christ, Sherlock!

1291
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:07,807
Give my love to Mary.
Tell her she's safe now.

1292
01:22:37,207 --> 01:22:38,247
Oh, Sherlock.

1293
01:22:40,847 --> 01:22:41,967
What have you done?

1294
01:22:51,847 --> 01:22:54,126
As my colleague is
fond of remarking,

1295
01:22:54,127 --> 01:22:57,366
this country sometimes needs
a blunt instrument.

1296
01:22:57,367 --> 01:23:00,126
Equally,
it sometimes needs a dagger,

1297
01:23:00,127 --> 01:23:04,487
a scalpel wielded with precision
and without remorse.

1298
01:23:06,647 --> 01:23:11,166
There will always come a time
when we need Sherlock Holmes.

1299
01:23:11,167 --> 01:23:15,286
If this is some expression
of familial sentiment...

1300
01:23:15,287 --> 01:23:16,486
Don't be absurd.

1301
01:23:16,487 --> 01:23:19,527
I am not given to
outbursts of brotherly compassion.

1302
01:23:21,447 --> 01:23:24,406
You know what
happened to the other one.

1303
01:23:24,407 --> 01:23:28,126
In any event, there is no prison in
which we could incarcerate Sherlock

1304
01:23:28,127 --> 01:23:31,486
without causing a riot
on a daily basis.

1305
01:23:31,487 --> 01:23:37,206
The alternative, however,
would require your approval.

1306
01:23:37,207 --> 01:23:39,126
Hardly merciful, Mr Holmes.

1307
01:23:39,127 --> 01:23:44,247
Regrettably, Lady Smallwood,
my brother is a murderer.

1308
01:23:57,327 --> 01:23:59,726
You will look after him for me,
won't you?

1309
01:23:59,727 --> 01:24:02,847
Hmm. Don't worry.
I'll keep him in trouble.

1310
01:24:03,887 --> 01:24:04,967
That's my girl.

1311
01:24:10,007 --> 01:24:13,286
Since this is likely to be the last
conversation I'll have with John Watson,

1312
01:24:13,287 --> 01:24:15,207
would you mind if we took a moment?

1313
01:24:24,247 --> 01:24:25,927
So here we are.

1314
01:24:28,047 --> 01:24:29,966
William Sherlock Scott Holmes.

1315
01:24:29,967 --> 01:24:31,086
Sorry?

1316
01:24:31,087 --> 01:24:33,607
That's the whole of it.
If you're looking for baby names.

1317
01:24:34,927 --> 01:24:37,766
No, we've had a scan,
we're pretty sure it's a girl.

1318
01:24:37,767 --> 01:24:39,167
Oh. OK.

1319
01:24:44,407 --> 01:24:46,366
Yeah.

1320
01:24:46,367 --> 01:24:48,966
You know, actually, I can't
think of a single thing to say.

1321
01:24:48,967 --> 01:24:50,327
No, neither can I.

1322
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:53,366
The game is over.

1323
01:24:53,367 --> 01:24:56,246
The game is never over, John.

1324
01:24:56,247 --> 01:24:58,286
But there may be some
new players now.

1325
01:24:58,287 --> 01:25:01,847
That's OK, the East Wind takes us
all in the end. What's that?

1326
01:25:03,367 --> 01:25:06,086
It's a story my brother told me
when we were kids.

1327
01:25:06,087 --> 01:25:10,606
The East Wind is a terrifying force
that lays waste to all in its path.

1328
01:25:10,607 --> 01:25:14,046
It seeks out the unworthy
and plucks them from the earth.

1329
01:25:14,047 --> 01:25:15,246
That was generally me.

1330
01:25:15,247 --> 01:25:17,687
Nice!
He's a rubbish big brother.

1331
01:25:19,127 --> 01:25:24,166
So what about you, then?
Where are you actually going now?

1332
01:25:24,167 --> 01:25:26,766
Oh, some undercover
work in Eastern Europe.

1333
01:25:26,767 --> 01:25:28,166
For how long?

1334
01:25:28,167 --> 01:25:33,366
Six months, my brother estimates.
He's never wrong.

1335
01:25:33,367 --> 01:25:34,447
And then what?

1336
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:39,047
Who knows?

1337
01:25:45,287 --> 01:25:51,126
John, there's something I should
say, I've meant to say always

1338
01:25:51,127 --> 01:25:52,566
and I never have.

1339
01:25:52,567 --> 01:25:56,487
Since it's unlikely we'll ever meet
again, I might as well say it now.

1340
01:26:00,127 --> 01:26:02,447
Sherlock is actually a girl's name.

1341
01:26:05,847 --> 01:26:07,046
It's not.

1342
01:26:07,047 --> 01:26:08,246
It was worth a try.

1343
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:10,486
We're not naming our daughter
after you.

1344
01:26:10,487 --> 01:26:12,007
Oh, I think it could work.

1345
01:26:18,687 --> 01:26:20,487
To the very best of times, John.

1346
01:27:07,607 --> 01:27:10,166
'Smith brings it inside.
This looks good.

1347
01:27:10,167 --> 01:27:13,127
'Cassandra comes in for a shot.
Ooh, he missed it!'

1348
01:27:14,567 --> 01:27:18,727
Oi, there's something wrong with the telly.
There's something wrong with the telly, mate.

1349
01:27:20,687 --> 01:27:22,246
Who's that?

1350
01:27:22,247 --> 01:27:23,806
Did you miss me?

1351
01:27:23,807 --> 01:27:27,046
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?

1352
01:27:27,047 --> 01:27:28,726
How is this possible?

1353
01:27:28,727 --> 01:27:31,566
We don't know, but it's on every
screen in the country.

1354
01:27:31,567 --> 01:27:33,046
Every screen simultaneously.

1355
01:27:33,047 --> 01:27:34,967
Has the Prime Minister been told?

1356
01:27:36,967 --> 01:27:38,326
And Mycroft?

1357
01:27:38,327 --> 01:27:41,407
But that's not possible. That is
simply not possible.

1358
01:27:44,327 --> 01:27:47,567
What's happened?
Sir? It's your brother.

1359
01:27:50,567 --> 01:27:51,646
Mycroft?

1360
01:27:51,647 --> 01:27:54,086
'Hello, little brother.
How's the exile going?'

1361
01:27:54,087 --> 01:27:55,566
I've only been gone four minutes.

1362
01:27:55,567 --> 01:27:57,766
Well, I certainly hope you've
learnt your lesson.

1363
01:27:57,767 --> 01:28:00,606
'As it turns out, you're needed.'

1364
01:28:00,607 --> 01:28:02,727
Oh, for God's sake,
make up your mind!

1365
01:28:03,727 --> 01:28:05,086
Who needs me this time?

1366
01:28:05,087 --> 01:28:08,686
'Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?

1367
01:28:08,687 --> 01:28:12,286
'Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?'

1368
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:13,846
England.

1369
01:28:13,847 --> 01:28:16,446
But he's dead. I mean, you told me
he was dead, Moriarty?

1370
01:28:16,447 --> 01:28:18,326
Absolutely. Blew his own brains out.

1371
01:28:18,327 --> 01:28:20,326
So how can he be back?

1372
01:28:20,327 --> 01:28:24,607
Well if he is,
he'd better wrap up warm.

1373
01:28:26,447 --> 01:28:28,087
There's an East Wind coming.

1374
01:28:33,584 --> 01:29:00,507
