1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:02,501
<i>Previously on dexter...</i>

2
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:03,567
- Deb's alive.

3
00:00:03,567 --> 00:00:04,567
They're taking her
to the hospital.

4
00:00:04,567 --> 00:00:06,133
- Who did this?

5
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:07,501
- He says it's smelling like
the vacation murderer's m. O.

6
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:09,601
- Then that's-
- Lundy.

7
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:11,267
- Lundy devoted his life
to hunting trinity.

8
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:13,000
- If it was trinity,
it would explain

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,100
why deb is alive
and Lundy isn't.

10
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,968
I'm gonna follow
Lundy's theory

11
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:18,501
and check his hotel room
for clues.

12
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:20,501
- You can't let these be logged
into evidence.

13
00:00:23,434 --> 00:00:25,200
- I just unsealed
the juvy records

14
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,701
of Johnny rose,
our vacation murder suspect.

15
00:00:27,701 --> 00:00:30,000
Shoplifting with his High School
girlfriend Nikki wald.

16
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:33,234
Nikki!

17
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:34,234
- Put the gun down.

18
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:38,234
- We got 'em, Morgan.
- Got who?

19
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:39,667
- Nikki wald and Johnny rose.
Well, we got Nikki.

20
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,033
Johnny's on his way
to the morgue.

21
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:43,300
- This department can't risk
a defense attorney

22
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,033
turning your romantic
involvement

23
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:47,200
into a courtroom sideshow every
time you work a case together.

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,467
- What are you saying?

25
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:50,300
- I am saying I need you
to transfer sergeant Batista

26
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,367
out of homicide.

27
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:52,801
- This is bullshit.

28
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:54,267
- I would have
been here sooner,

29
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:56,100
but I got hung up
on the phone.

30
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,033
Your landlord called.
- Oh.

31
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,000
I was just hanging on
to the place

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,267
until the lease ran out.

33
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:02,834
- Why'd you tell me
you got rid of it?

34
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:06,667
- So you didn't have an affair
with my father?

35
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,400
- I don't know
who you're looking for, honey,

36
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,901
but it ain't me.

37
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:12,501
- I'm halfway through
the c. I. Files you gave me.

38
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:14,934
Maybe then I'll finally get
some answers.

39
00:01:14,934 --> 00:01:16,200
- Can I help you?

40
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,701
- I'm taking on a project.

41
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:20,367
- I'd go
with the framing hammer.

42
00:01:22,868 --> 00:01:25,434
You made me do this.

43
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:31,634
- What are you doing?

44
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:33,267
He doesn't belong here.

45
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:36,067
It doesn't make sense.

46
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:40,300
Trinity's a husband,
a father.

47
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,968
He's...

48
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,367
Like me.

49
00:01:53,601 --> 00:02:01,634
* *

50
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,300
- * have you been to Jesus *

51
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,834
* for the cleansing power? *

52
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:38,000
* are you washed
in the blood *

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,367
* of the lamb? *

54
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:42,634
* are you fully trusting *

55
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:44,534
* in his grace
this hour? *

56
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:46,234
* are you washed *

57
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:49,767
* in the blood
of the lamb? *

58
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:51,968
* lay aside the garments *

59
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:53,467
* that are stained
with sin *

60
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,901
- a wolf in sheep's clothing.

61
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,701
Hour by hour,
the spitting image

62
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,400
of a normal man.

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,000
Up at 6:00 A.M.

64
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:07,000
Breakfast, 7:00 A.M.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,667
Work, 8:30.

66
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:11,701
Study session.
Shaping young minds.

67
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:13,300
Even on a Saturday.

68
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,734
Noon lunch
with faculty.

69
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:18,801
Out at 3:00.
Dinner at 6:00.

70
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:23,367
Father, husband,
teacher, Deacon.

71
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:26,234
All in the name
of blending in.

72
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:29,033
Camouflage
is nature's craftiest trick.

73
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:36,033
This is what makes a home:

74
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:38,200
The noise of happy children,

75
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,901
the warmth
of a full house,

76
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:44,067
the chill
of an angry wife.

77
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:47,000
- Is that the last
of it?

78
00:04:48,934 --> 00:04:50,801
- Just a few more things
to pack up.

79
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:51,968
- Not like
you're dragging it out.

80
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:53,968
Uh, that's for the kids.

81
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:56,601
If you're hungry,
there's food in the fridge.

82
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:59,501
- Oh, I could go
for a sandwich.

83
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:00,767
- We're out of bread.

84
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,801
- She has to forgive me
for my apartment eventually.

85
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:04,801
Doesn't she?

86
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:10,968
Maybe I should hang on to it
just in case, huh?

87
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:17,400
- This is so awesome.

88
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,133
- Hello?
- Dexter.

89
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:22,634
- Out of the way.
- Sheesh.

90
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,501
- I made an appointment

91
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,934
with the new therapist
for tomorrow at noon.

92
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:39,934
- New therapist?

93
00:05:39,934 --> 00:05:41,801
- It's an emergency,
Dexter.

94
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,033
Or don't you think so?

95
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:45,534
- No, of course.

96
00:05:45,534 --> 00:05:47,100
I mean,
whatever you need.

97
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:51,400
- This isn't for me.
This is for us.

98
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,334
This doesn't belong here.

99
00:06:04,534 --> 00:06:07,334
- Hey, can you give me
a ride to the station?

100
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,501
Batista's taking another run
at Nikki wald today.

101
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:10,934
She confessed to everything

102
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:12,934
except for the part
where she shot me and Lundy.

103
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:14,534
- Because she didn't.
Trinity did.

104
00:06:14,534 --> 00:06:16,000
But I can't tell deb.

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,334
I need a head start.

106
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:23,100
Morgan.
Yes, I know where that is.

107
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,234
Thanks.

108
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:27,534
Got to go.
Bludgeoning downtown.

109
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:29,367
Trinity's latest victim.

110
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:30,367
About time.

111
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:32,701
- 100 ocean Gate?

112
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,567
- Yeah, how'd you know that?

113
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:39,734
- Because that's where Lundy
thought it would be.

114
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:42,067
We could have stopped it

115
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:44,367
if fucking Nikki wald
and her shitstain boyfriend

116
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:45,701
didn't shoot us.

117
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:48,200
- Deb, it's gonna be okay.

118
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,067
I'm going to kill trinity
for you.

119
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:54,667
- Can you just give me a ride
to the station, please?

120
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,400
- Yeah, I'll drop you off
on my way downtown.

121
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Come on.

122
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:11,467
The last victim
in the cycle of three.

123
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:13,968
Trinity's done...

124
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:17,267
For now.

125
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:20,200
He's retreated
to the safety of his camouflage.

126
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,834
His defenses will be down.

127
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:23,701
Perfect time to strike.

128
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:26,200
- Oh. Jesus.

129
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,467
- I just have to stay ahead
of my colleagues.

130
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:29,968
- Two days' worth
of decay.

131
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:31,534
The body's been here
since Friday.

132
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,000
Building was closed
over the weekend.

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
No a/c.

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,300
- What's the spatter say?

135
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,968
- Blunt force trauma
to the head.

136
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:39,801
- Duh.

137
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:41,234
- Judging from the spray,
we're looking

138
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:43,334
at somebody tall,
over six feet.

139
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:44,934
- That all you got?

140
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:47,834
- That's all I can tell ya.

141
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:06,100
He moved the arm...

142
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,267
For a reason.

143
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,634
Can't leave this behind.

144
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:17,801
It might get them closer.

145
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,367
- Give me.

146
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:23,767
- That's okay.
I got it.

147
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:26,000
- Evidence hog. You got buckets
of blood to worry about.

148
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:32,701
See the oval grid
pattern there?

149
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:34,667
Comes from a framing hammer.

150
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,467
- Duh.

151
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:38,267
I'll check some out
in the spatter room.

152
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,767
See if I can narrow it down.

153
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:42,334
How do you know
so much about hammers?

154
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:45,501
- Not a tool
I haven't played with,

155
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:48,534
my friend.

156
00:08:53,834 --> 00:09:01,834
* *

157
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:12,434
- okay, the FBI Agent,

158
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:13,767
he was shot
at a business hotel.

159
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,501
- But you were so high,
you don't even remember, do you?

160
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:17,234
- No, no, no.
No. I never blacked out.

161
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:18,434
Never.

162
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:20,767
- Bullshit,
you fucking junkie whore.

163
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:21,767
- Do you remember shooting at-

164
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:26,067
- Quinn.
- You shouldn't be here, Morgan.

165
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,334
Watching this
is only gonna fuck you up.

166
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,534
- I'm already fucked up.

167
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,934
- Look, Nikki's going away
for a long time.

168
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:32,000
She confessed
to the vacation murders

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and to killing Johnny rose.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,567
- But not to Lundy.

171
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:35,901
- The whole department
knows she's lying,

172
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:36,901
but we got nothing.

173
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:38,868
No evidence,
no eyewitnesses,

174
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:40,167
so it is what it is.

175
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,634
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

176
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:57,100
I came at Nikki wald
from every which way,

177
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,601
but she's still
holding out on us.

178
00:09:58,601 --> 00:10:00,901
- Brass wants her transferred
to county.

179
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,501
So it's out of our hands.

180
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:03,567
- Shit.

181
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:05,634
I didn't want
to leave homicide

182
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:07,300
with deb and Lundy unsolved.

183
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,067
- That's out
of our hands too.

184
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,934
- I haven't told anyone yet

185
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:13,267
about me transferring.

186
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:15,567
- There's no need
until it's official.

187
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:17,367
I haven't even turned
in the paperwork.

188
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,467
- Is that it?

189
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:21,601
- No, that's homicide.

190
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:23,133
- Just come in today?

191
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:24,667
- This morning.

192
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:33,000
Didn't make sense to call you in
on something new.

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,467
- Bludgeoning.

194
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,467
Nasty.

195
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:39,267
You got any leads?

196
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,567
- Hey, if I'd known
you'd be transferred...

197
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:47,634
- Maria, don't.

198
00:10:47,634 --> 00:10:50,100
Telling Matthews about us
was the right thing to do.

199
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,934
Working fraud
will be good for me.

200
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:53,667
15% pay bump,

201
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,133
promotion to lieutenant,
better hours,

202
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:57,834
and chances are
I'm not gonna be getting shot at

203
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:59,934
sitting behind a desk
all day.

204
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:03,834
- You hate
sitting behind a desk.

205
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:07,100
- But I love being with you.

206
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,968
- I'm perfectly comfortable
with bodily fluids:

207
00:11:23,968 --> 00:11:26,300
Blood, snot, tears.

208
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,300
But the emotions
that go along with them,

209
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,968
not so much.

210
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:35,968
- Dexter, are you hearing
what Rita is saying?

211
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:45,834
- She's upset.

212
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:48,501
About the apartment.

213
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:51,133
- The apartment isn't really
the issue right now.

214
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:54,033
- It's not?

215
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:56,634
- You see? It's like
he doesn't even listen.

216
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:58,067
He's always in his head,

217
00:11:58,067 --> 00:11:59,434
and when he does talk to me,

218
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:01,234
it's all lies,
all the time.

219
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:03,701
- Not...

220
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:05,734
All the time.

221
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:07,601
- I thought
we were past this.

222
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,200
With the drugs
and lila.

223
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,400
- Who's lila?
- My sponsor.

224
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,834
- Homicidal bitch
he slept with.

225
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:14,734
- Okay.

226
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,901
- Now we're married.

227
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:21,267
You know, we have
a child together.

228
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:23,000
And you're
still keeping secrets.

229
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,734
- Rita, I can see
that you're upset.

230
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:29,033
But, as you describe it,

231
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:31,400
this isn't new behavior
for Dexter.

232
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:34,100
- What do you mean?

233
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,067
- It sounds like you
knew about him

234
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:38,534
when you married him.

235
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:42,300
- What?
I hoped he would change.

236
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,033
- When you married
your ex-husband,

237
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:46,901
did you think
he would change too?

238
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:54,901
- Okay. Okay, so I have
some responsibility here too.

239
00:13:03,234 --> 00:13:05,167
I don't want to keep making
the same mistakes.

240
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:08,000
- Me neither.

241
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
We'll work it out.
We always work it out.

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,734
- I need a partner,
Dexter.

243
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,934
Someone I can trust.

244
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:20,567
Unless you can be
completely honest with me...

245
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,000
I don't want to do this
anymore.

246
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,601
- I'm doing everything I can
to save my family,

247
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:36,634
and I'm still failing.

248
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:39,033
Rita's picturing her life
without me,

249
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:43,534
and I can't picture mine
without her...

250
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:46,167
Or the kids.

251
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,467
Harrison.

252
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:48,767
- Is that the hammer?

253
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:51,534
- The depth is too shallow.

254
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:52,968
Murder weapon was heavier.

255
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:54,300
- Well, narrow it down, Dex.

256
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,534
We need a model number.

257
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,267
Maybe we can track it
to a hardware store

258
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:58,434
or an Internet site.

259
00:13:58,434 --> 00:13:59,701
- I'll try the 22-ouncer.

260
00:14:04,868 --> 00:14:06,667
What's going on?

261
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:07,968
- DNA.

262
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,267
- Whose DNA?
The victim's?

263
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:14,868
The killer's?
- Wait for it.

264
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:18,000
Okay, that smudge

265
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,601
you found
at the crime scene...

266
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,267
Cremated human remains.

267
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:27,868
That fragment
was a little piece of bone.

268
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,133
And thanks to the wonders
of technology

269
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:31,834
and to my
own scientific prowess...

270
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:33,601
- You rehydrated it and?

271
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:34,834
- Dude, I told you
to wait for it.

272
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:38,567
And I found two strains
of DNA.

273
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:40,033
One from the fragment

274
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:43,267
and one from saliva.

275
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:44,400
- Whose saliva?

276
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
- The killer's.
Come on, buddy.

277
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,200
Try to keep up.

278
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,901
How do you think he got the
ashes to stick to the wall?

279
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:54,200
- We got
the killer's goddamn DNA?

280
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,767
- You f-in' know it.

281
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,868
I rock, right?
- Yeah, you do today.

282
00:14:57,868 --> 00:14:59,901
Run it through every database
you can think of.

283
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:01,133
- Okay.
- We're gonna find this guy.

284
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:03,667
- No, you won't.

285
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:04,868
Arthur Mitchell isn't in any

286
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:06,968
of our police databases.

287
00:15:06,968 --> 00:15:09,901
I already ran him.
He's squeaky clean.

288
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:11,801
He hides the real him,

289
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:14,367
except from those ashes.

290
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:16,501
He can only be honest
with the dead.

291
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:26,400
- Morgan.

292
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,067
I need those vacation murder
files back.

293
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:29,267
Got to finish my report.

294
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:30,868
- Just give me
another hour.

295
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:33,100
There's got to be something that
puts Nikki at Lundy's hotel.

296
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,934
- Morgan, we got it covered.

297
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,901
And you shouldn't
be working anyway.

298
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:38,100
You're on sick leave.

299
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,634
Go home.

300
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:40,634
I'll keep you posted.

301
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:44,367
Okay?

302
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,734
- One unheard message.

303
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:55,267
- Hi, I'm calling
for Debra Morgan.

304
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:57,467
This is Valerie Hodges
returning your call

305
00:15:57,467 --> 00:15:59,367
from a few weeks ago.

306
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:01,067
Sorry it took me so long

307
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:02,534
to call you back,
but when you said

308
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:03,934
you were Harry Morgan's
daughter,

309
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:05,667
I wasn't sure what to do.

310
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:08,267
I figured I'd just call,
be direct,

311
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,734
so if you want
to know the truth...

312
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:13,467
- I told you
to stop working.

313
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:15,234
- That wasn't work.

314
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:17,667
That was way personal.
- Come on.

315
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:19,901
For you?
Same difference.

316
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:37,501
- She wants a partner.

317
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:40,200
One who can open up.

318
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,501
Okay, I'll share.

319
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,601
About what?

320
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:46,467
Work.

321
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:48,634
Spatter analysis?

322
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,834
No.
Something personal.

323
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,968
Trinity?
Too personal.

324
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:55,334
Food?

325
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:56,801
I'm hungry.
I could tell her that.

326
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:59,868
- We're out of bread again.

327
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:03,734
- I'll go get some.

328
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:20,067
Arthur's kept this up
for, what, 28 years?

329
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:22,067
My family
may not last 20 minutes.

330
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:25,634
Warmth, intimacy.

331
00:17:25,634 --> 00:17:27,534
He's convincing.

332
00:17:27,534 --> 00:17:28,934
But why the show?

333
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:30,067
I'm the only one watching.

334
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:33,334
Unless it's more
than just camouflage.

335
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:38,501
That's honest affection

336
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:40,701
sustained for years.

337
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:43,701
But he's like me.
How does he do it?

338
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,100
I will kill him.
I need to.

339
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,534
But right now
I need to save my family more.

340
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:56,234
His cycle is over.

341
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:58,033
It'll be a while
before he kills again,

342
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:01,000
so he's not
an immediate threat.

343
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,701
And I have so much
to learn.

344
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:07,601
- Arthur Mitchell.

345
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:13,901
- Kyle Butler.

346
00:18:13,901 --> 00:18:15,067
- Four walls, one heart.

347
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:16,801
We build homes
for the homeless.

348
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:19,734
We meet at my house,
then head to the site together.

349
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:21,100
My address is right
on the flyer.

350
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,534
- Thanks.

351
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,634
I've been looking for a way
to get more involved.

352
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:28,300
- What brings you
to sacred fellowship, Kyle?

353
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,968
- Um...

354
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:34,234
Looking for something.

355
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:36,300
Answers.

356
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:41,434
My wife and I,
we separated.

357
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:44,200
She kicked me out

358
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,434
and took the kids.

359
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:50,334
I didn't know
where else to go.

360
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,534
- You came
to the right place, son.

361
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:08,667
- I just got an email
from my editor.

362
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,968
- Yeah?
Anything good?

363
00:19:10,968 --> 00:19:13,701
- Well, he wants more from me
on the vacation murders.

364
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:19,734
I'm not asking
for any inside scoop.

365
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:22,467
- Yeah, 'cause we know how well
that worked out last time.

366
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:25,968
What?

367
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:29,868
- If you could just help me
get an interview

368
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,467
with Debra Morgan...

369
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:32,901
- You got to be kidding me.

370
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:34,534
- It'd be a hero piece

371
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:35,834
about the shooting.

372
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:37,234
- No.
No way.

373
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:38,567
- She's your partner.

374
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,133
- Yeah,
add to that the fact

375
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,033
that her brother has a bug
up his ass about me.

376
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:47,601
Let's just say I'd rather
you left it alone.

377
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:48,767
- Oh.

378
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:51,567
Since when did that
ever stop me

379
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,267
from getting
what I want?

380
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:59,334
- Oh, hold on.
It might be the station.

381
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,167
Quinn.

382
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:06,000
- Look out your window.

383
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:13,100
- Be back in a sec,
okay?

384
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:17,667
Hey.

385
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:20,701
- I want to be
an eyewitness for the shooting.

386
00:20:23,534 --> 00:20:25,133
- I thought you said
you didn't see anything.

387
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:28,968
- I was in shock.

388
00:20:28,968 --> 00:20:29,968
My memory was fuzzy.

389
00:20:29,968 --> 00:20:31,901
- Now it's clear.

390
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:34,601
- There's no doubt
in my mind

391
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,133
that Nikki shot me
and Frank.

392
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:37,601
- Mine either.

393
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:39,100
Are you talking
about going on the record?

394
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,767
And what happens later

395
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:42,434
if you decide
you're still confused?

396
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:45,133
- I won't.

397
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:47,267
- You sure?

398
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:48,734
Because if this comes back
to bite you in the ass,

399
00:20:48,734 --> 00:20:49,734
you're screwed.

400
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:57,067
- My dad used to say
a good cop

401
00:20:57,067 --> 00:21:00,467
does whatever it takes
to close a case.

402
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,701
- Other cops.
Not you.

403
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:05,767
Just think about it,
okay?

404
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:07,000
I'd hate to have you
make a decision

405
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,767
when your head's
not on straight.

406
00:21:21,267 --> 00:21:24,501
- They're on
a wild goose Chase.

407
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:27,567
No way they'll find a match
to trinity's DNA.

408
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:29,300
He's too well-hidden.

409
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:33,501
I could be helping,

410
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,734
finding the hammer he used.

411
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:37,434
Or I could help someone
in need-

412
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:38,767
me.

413
00:21:48,334 --> 00:21:50,133
Preliminary spatter report

414
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:51,467
on the bludgeoning.

415
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:53,267
- We land
on the specific hammer

416
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:54,501
for the murder weapon?

417
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:55,934
- Narrowing it down.
I'll keep you posted.

418
00:21:55,934 --> 00:21:58,300
I'm actually heading out now
to do some field research.

419
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,934
- Well, how about you, Vince?

420
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:01,834
You got anything for me
on that DNA?

421
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,334
- No matches
in the criminal database.

422
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:05,968
- Duh.

423
00:22:05,968 --> 00:22:07,100
- Wait.

424
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,801
You're gonna miss
the big reveal.

425
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:14,534
Because I'm me, and I happen
to think outside the box,

426
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:15,968
and I happen to be
an awesome forensic tech-

427
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,200
- masuka.

428
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,300
- I ran the human remains
against the saliva

429
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,200
and guess what I found,

430
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,834
matching mitochondrial DNA.

431
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,033
<i>- English, por favor.</i>

432
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:29,501
- The killer is related
to the human remains.

433
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:30,834
Same family.

434
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:35,634
- He keeps his family with him
all the time.

435
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:37,868
- Well, are they
gonna go visit him in prison?

436
00:22:37,868 --> 00:22:39,367
'Cause this is going
to get him caught.

437
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:40,534
- Maybe he wants
to get caught.

438
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:41,701
- Or he's sending a message.

439
00:22:41,701 --> 00:22:43,033
- Or he's trying to leave

440
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:45,367
some kind of legacy.

441
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:48,801
- Hey. How come you're
not working this case?

442
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:52,801
- I'm busy.

443
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:54,234
Got a report
to finish.

444
00:22:56,701 --> 00:22:58,234
- His family keeps him safe,

445
00:22:58,234 --> 00:23:00,634
but these ashes
leave him exposed.

446
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:02,567
Maybe this is
how I get to the truth.

447
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:08,000
The murder weapon.

448
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,334
He's using it out in the open

449
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:11,334
for all the world
to see.

450
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:14,901
Not something I would do.

451
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:17,567
But Arthur has tools
that I don't.

452
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:25,434
- Hey. Glad to see
you made it.

453
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:26,601
Kyle Butler.

454
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:28,234
- You remember my name.

455
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:29,834
- Oh, I'm like an elephant.

456
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:31,901
I never forget.

457
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:33,167
You didn't have any tools
to bring?

458
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:34,767
- Lost 'em in the move.

459
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:37,534
- Well, here.
Take my hammer.

460
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:41,868
Take good care of her,
though.

461
00:23:41,868 --> 00:23:43,767
We've been through a lot
together.

462
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:45,367
- So I saw.

463
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:46,534
Very kind of you,
Arthur.

464
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:49,334
- Well, generosity of spirit,
Kyle.

465
00:23:49,334 --> 00:23:50,734
It's the reason
we're all here.

466
00:23:50,734 --> 00:23:52,133
- Not all of us.

467
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:54,534
- Come on.
I'll get you set up.

468
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:56,100
- Okay.

469
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,100
Grant 24-ounce steel framing
hammer, model number 514.

470
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,701
Laguerta will be pleased.

471
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:03,434
- Just bang in these three.

472
00:24:03,434 --> 00:24:04,734
They're already marked.

473
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,801
- Uh-huh.

474
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,968
But I have
more important questions.

475
00:24:11,968 --> 00:24:14,100
So, Arthur, you and your family
been doing this a long time?

476
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,234
- For years.

477
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:18,334
I took Sally on a build
for our very first date.

478
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,934
And the kids have been coming

479
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:23,300
ever since they could hold
a hammer.

480
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:29,767
- You all seem
really close. Happy.

481
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,000
- Yeah.

482
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,100
We are.

483
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,100
- Envious.

484
00:24:56,701 --> 00:24:57,934
You're Arthur's son,
right?

485
00:24:57,934 --> 00:24:59,601
I'm Kyle.

486
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:00,601
- Oh, Jonah.

487
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:03,100
Nice to meet you.
- Seems polite.

488
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,033
Well adjusted.
How's it going?

489
00:25:05,033 --> 00:25:06,267
- It's hot.

490
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:08,834
- It's nice that you're here,
though.

491
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:09,868
Got to be other ways

492
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:11,000
you'd rather spend
your afternoon.

493
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,667
- Well, no, it's okay.

494
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:14,801
You know, mom and dad
are big on the family time.

495
00:25:14,801 --> 00:25:16,834
- That's nice.

496
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:20,000
For too many kids,
family time means fighting time.

497
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,868
- Not mine.
- Never?

498
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:25,100
- Not much to fight about,
really.

499
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,400
My parents are cool.

500
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,567
- Yeah, your dad seems
like a special guy.

501
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:30,567
- He is.

502
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:32,834
I- I really lucked out.

503
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:34,834
- How so?

504
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:37,667
- A lot of ways.
Like, you see that?

505
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:39,367
It's been my dad's baby
for years.

506
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:41,400
A few days ago,
he hands me the keys.

507
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,734
- Generosity of spirit.

508
00:25:43,734 --> 00:25:46,167
- Foundation of love, man.

509
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:47,467
Best dad ever.

510
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:49,767
- Father of the freakin' year.

511
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,167
- Oh, I got to get back
to work.

512
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:59,067
Dad's not a big fan
of idle hands.

513
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,200
- Hey, Nikki.

514
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:13,367
You remember me?

515
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:15,834
- Yeah.
That cop.

516
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:18,901
- Detective.

517
00:26:18,901 --> 00:26:19,901
The one you shot.

518
00:26:19,901 --> 00:26:22,167
- Jesus Christ.

519
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:25,968
Here we go again.

520
00:26:25,968 --> 00:26:27,901
I told your boss
everything already.

521
00:26:27,901 --> 00:26:32,234
- Now you're gonna tell me.

522
00:26:32,234 --> 00:26:34,033
Only this time
you're gonna tell the truth.

523
00:26:34,033 --> 00:26:35,234
- I told you.

524
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:37,200
I've been telling the truth
the whole time.

525
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,567
- Well, then come here
and tell it to my face.

526
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:42,868
- This is so fucking stupid.

527
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:49,434
- A bit closer
so I can see your eyes.

528
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,234
- The night
that you got shot,

529
00:27:01,234 --> 00:27:03,067
I was in a hotel room
with Johnny.

530
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:04,534
- Bullshit.

531
00:27:04,534 --> 00:27:06,901
- We did meth,

532
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:08,567
we watched porn,
we fucked.

533
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:10,601
I mean, we were watching
cartoons all night.

534
00:27:10,601 --> 00:27:11,934
What do you want?
What do you want?

535
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:13,133
- You fucking liar.

536
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,601
- No matter how many times
you ask me,

537
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,133
it's not going to change.

538
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:19,601
I didn't shoot you,
okay?

539
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:21,701
I didn't kill that old man.

540
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:26,934
Ow! Fuck!
Jesus Christ!

541
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,934
- I'm gonna say I saw you.

542
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:33,968
- People get mugged every day.

543
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:36,634
Maybe-maybe somebody else
wanted you dead, huh?

544
00:27:36,634 --> 00:27:38,067
- Like who? Like who?

545
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:41,734
- Oh, fuck. You're a fucking cop
for Christ's sakes.

546
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:43,734
You piss people off
for a living.

547
00:27:43,734 --> 00:27:45,000
- Fuck you.

548
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,267
- Fuck you.
Fucking hurting me.

549
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,234
- You think that hurts?

550
00:27:52,234 --> 00:27:53,701
Try watching the man you love

551
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:57,000
die right in front of you
with nothing you can do.

552
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,267
Oh, right.

553
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,734
You shot your own boyfriend.

554
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:10,200
You nasty piece of shit.

555
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,767
- I killed Johnny.
I know. I killed...

556
00:28:17,968 --> 00:28:22,834
I do miss Johnny.
I know.

557
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,534
If you-
if you say

558
00:28:25,534 --> 00:28:27,868
that you saw me
kill Frank Lundy,

559
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:29,367
then you're the liar.

560
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:31,133
You are the liar!

561
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,834
- I'd like to be transferred

562
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:42,067
out of homicide.

563
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:43,968
- Always looking
for the next best thing,

564
00:28:43,968 --> 00:28:45,667
hey, lieutenant?
- Aren't we all?

565
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:47,367
- Mm.

566
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:48,968
- I could use a change
of scenery.

567
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:52,501
I'm thinking press liaison.

568
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:56,033
- Well, p. R. Could certainly use
your political skills.

569
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:58,234
- And sergeant Batista
could stay in homicide.

570
00:28:58,234 --> 00:29:02,133
- Well, let me think
about it.

571
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:04,200
We both know
you're not easily replaced.

572
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,334
- That didn't seem
to be a problem before.

573
00:29:09,934 --> 00:29:11,701
- I'll let you know
what I decide.

574
00:29:16,434 --> 00:29:18,501
- Hello.

575
00:29:18,501 --> 00:29:19,801
- Tell me that's
the last of it.

576
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:20,934
The last bag
from your apartment.

577
00:29:20,934 --> 00:29:22,601
- It's not from my apartment.

578
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:23,834
But, Rita, wait, wait.

579
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:26,000
Surprise for you,
for all of you.

580
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,167
- No way.
A Nintendo ds?

581
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,934
- I know it's not an iPod...
- A mini DVD player?

582
00:29:31,934 --> 00:29:34,100
This is awesome.

583
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,100
- For Harrison.

584
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:47,100
And for my lovely wife.

585
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,534
- A bread maker?

586
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:52,234
- We're always running
out of bread.

587
00:29:52,234 --> 00:29:54,400
- We're always running
out of milk.

588
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,868
Did you get me a cow too?

589
00:29:55,868 --> 00:29:57,767
- Thank you so much!

590
00:29:57,767 --> 00:29:59,701
- This is so awesome.
Thank you, Dexter.

591
00:29:59,701 --> 00:30:03,534
- You're welcome.

592
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:12,767
What's the matter?
You don't like your gift?

593
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:15,133
- I appreciate you trying.

594
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:17,067
I really do.

595
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:19,901
But we don't need gifts.

596
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,234
We need you.

597
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:28,000
- Need me to do what?

598
00:30:31,634 --> 00:30:32,834
- Just talk to me.

599
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:39,801
- I'm, uh...

600
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:42,033
People just do this?

601
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:44,000
Say what they're thinking?

602
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,300
Out loud?

603
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:51,501
- How hard can it be?

604
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:53,501
- I'm trying.
I'm trying.

605
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,534
- You know what?

606
00:30:57,534 --> 00:31:00,200
You can try harder
in therapy.

607
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,634
I'm moving up
our next session.

608
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:12,667
- Wow.

609
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:13,901
What's the occasion?

610
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:15,501
- I have good news.

611
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,000
You want to guess?

612
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,534
- Um, you're naked
under there,

613
00:31:19,534 --> 00:31:20,901
and I get to see?

614
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:24,834
Guess what else
you get to do?

615
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:28,367
- Okay, now I'm really having
impure thoughts.

616
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:32,033
- You get to stay
in homicide.

617
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:36,000
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

618
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,200
- Wow.
How did you-

619
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,901
- I had a little talk
with the deputy chief,

620
00:31:38,901 --> 00:31:41,968
and I told him homicide
couldn't afford to lose you.

621
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:43,634
And neither could I.

622
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:47,501
- You...

623
00:31:47,501 --> 00:31:49,100
Are...

624
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,100
Amazing.

625
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,300
- Mm-hmm.

626
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,534
- So he's okay
with both of us staying?

627
00:31:57,334 --> 00:32:00,534
- Well, we can talk
about logistics later.

628
00:32:00,534 --> 00:32:01,667
Right?

629
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:07,701
- You told him
you'd leave instead.

630
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:10,634
- Angel.

631
00:32:10,634 --> 00:32:12,667
It just makes more sense.

632
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:14,734
- You're full of it.

633
00:32:14,734 --> 00:32:17,300
You're sweet,
and you're beautiful,

634
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,334
but you're full of it,

635
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:21,834
and I can't let you do that.

636
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:26,601
- Well, I'm not
gonna let you leave homicide.

637
00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:28,067
You love it.

638
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:30,100
And if you leave,
you won't be you.

639
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,033
At least not the you
that I want to be with.

640
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:34,934
- What do we do?

641
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:42,367
- I don't know.

642
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:52,367
How are we supposed to decide
what's more important?

643
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:54,133
Our jobs or each other?

644
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,534
- Shit.

645
00:33:05,534 --> 00:33:08,100
- Shit is right.

646
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,400
- This is Arthur Mitchell

647
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,901
at his core.

648
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:18,601
Is there something
in his DNA

649
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:20,300
that lets him keep a family?

650
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,767
Some magic gene I'm missing?

651
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:27,033
- Looking for something?

652
00:33:27,033 --> 00:33:28,868
You're surfing on my turf,
blood guy.

653
00:33:28,868 --> 00:33:30,033
- I'm just curious.

654
00:33:30,033 --> 00:33:31,734
- Then you'll be interested
to know

655
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:34,601
that the mitochondrial DNA...

656
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:36,567
Female.

657
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:38,634
- So mother, daughter,

658
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:39,934
sister...

659
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,968
- Could even be his granny
he smudged on that wall.

660
00:33:41,968 --> 00:33:44,868
Probably whacks off
with her ashes.

661
00:33:44,868 --> 00:33:47,534
- Why would he do that?

662
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:49,100
- Why wouldn't he?

663
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,000
- Because she's important
to him.

664
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,033
- Dude. Joke.

665
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:56,434
- His history with her
shapes who he is.

666
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,767
- Like how my mother
breast-fed me till I was six

667
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:00,767
and now no one
will ever match up.

668
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:08,067
- Lieutenant.

669
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:11,267
It's a grant 24-ounce
steel framing hammer.

670
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:12,801
- Sorry?

671
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,834
- It's the murder weapon
in the bludgeoning case.

672
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:16,834
I did
some independent research.

673
00:34:16,834 --> 00:34:18,634
Updated my report.

674
00:34:18,634 --> 00:34:20,367
- Right. Right.
Thanks.

675
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:23,234
- Actually, I'm done
with my work for the day.

676
00:34:23,234 --> 00:34:24,334
If it's okay with you,

677
00:34:24,334 --> 00:34:25,734
I have some personal stuff
to take care of.

678
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:28,200
- Oh.

679
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,701
Take care of the personal stuff,
Dexter.

680
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:33,868
Take very good care.

681
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:38,400
- Sure as hell trying to.

682
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:49,968
- You know those things
never go bad.

683
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:52,634
- Well, yeah,
tell me about it.

684
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:56,067
I've had these
since I was a rookie.

685
00:34:56,067 --> 00:35:00,000
- So I never heard back from you
about being an eyewitness.

686
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,467
That mean
you changed your mind?

687
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,968
- Yeah.

688
00:35:04,968 --> 00:35:06,367
Just 'cause Nikki's
a piece of shit

689
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:07,868
and my dad was a lying sack

690
00:35:07,868 --> 00:35:09,167
doesn't mean I have to be.

691
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,534
Thanks for talking some sense
into me.

692
00:35:13,534 --> 00:35:16,601
- Just looking out
for my partner.

693
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:17,601
What's all this?

694
00:35:19,934 --> 00:35:22,367
- I'm thinking maybe Nikki wald
was telling the truth.

695
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:24,267
- Since when?

696
00:35:24,267 --> 00:35:26,868
- Since I talked
to her myself.

697
00:35:26,868 --> 00:35:29,300
- Wait, you what?

698
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,701
- I've been going over
everything you collected

699
00:35:30,701 --> 00:35:33,467
from Lundy's hotel and...

700
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:36,801
All his personal effects.

701
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,100
Here's the thing,

702
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,367
some of it's missing.

703
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:40,968
- No way.

704
00:35:40,968 --> 00:35:42,801
It was all logged in.
By me.

705
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:43,834
- Lundy had research books

706
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:45,567
on that serial killer
he was hunting.

707
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:47,200
And audio tapes.

708
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,901
I saw them in his room.

709
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:51,434
- You still wrapped up
in that, deb?

710
00:35:51,434 --> 00:35:53,634
I don't mean
to speak ill,

711
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:55,734
but the guy was chasing
a ghost.

712
00:35:57,667 --> 00:36:00,267
- I think that ghost
stole his books.

713
00:36:01,601 --> 00:36:03,100
- You got to stop.

714
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,467
You're making yourself crazy.

715
00:36:04,467 --> 00:36:07,300
- I'm telling you,
someone took Lundy's stuff.

716
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,467
- And I'm telling you,
you got to let this go.

717
00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:12,634
Look, I'm sure you're tired.

718
00:36:12,634 --> 00:36:16,067
Why don't you go home-
- and what?

719
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:17,834
Paint my fucking nails?

720
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:23,267
I'm kind of sick
of hearing it, Quinn.

721
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:27,167
- Then I guess
I won't say it anymore.

722
00:36:33,801 --> 00:36:36,601
- I am no longer seeing
lieutenant laguerta.

723
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:41,434
I mean, I see her every day,
but...

724
00:36:41,434 --> 00:36:43,133
- We broke up.

725
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:45,000
Officially.

726
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,467
- And permanently.

727
00:36:47,467 --> 00:36:49,901
- Are you sure?

728
00:36:49,901 --> 00:36:51,367
Because, frankly, I'm getting
a little sick

729
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:52,434
of the back and forth.

730
00:36:52,434 --> 00:36:54,934
- I apologize
for the inconvenience.

731
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:57,100
- Well, it's middle school
bullshit, lieutenant.

732
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,734
I really don't want
to have this conversation again.

733
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:01,200
- You won't have to.

734
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,701
We've both signed affidavits
to make it official.

735
00:37:02,701 --> 00:37:04,601
Our relationship
didn't interfere

736
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:07,133
with any
ongoing investigations,

737
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:09,200
and the department will not be
held liable for any fallout.

738
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,133
- Well, that's something
at least.

739
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:14,100
- For the record, neither one
of us was sexually harassed.

740
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,167
- Yeah, all advances
were very welcomed.

741
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:18,634
- And there was not
nor will there be

742
00:37:18,634 --> 00:37:20,734
a hostile work environment.

743
00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:23,467
- So it's done.

744
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:25,167
We're both staying
in homicide.

745
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:30,167
- Let me be clear.

746
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,400
The paperwork you're filing
is serious.

747
00:37:34,968 --> 00:37:36,467
If I find out
this is bullshit,

748
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:39,067
there will be consequences.

749
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:42,501
Severe, career-ending
consequences.

750
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:49,834
- Don't, angel.

751
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,167
It's over.

752
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:54,000
- Right.
Sorry.

753
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,868
- I should get back to work.

754
00:38:14,634 --> 00:38:16,434
- This is the last of it.

755
00:38:16,434 --> 00:38:19,767
My dark passenger's... Stuff

756
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:22,934
and the reason I can't let go
of my apartment.

757
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:24,701
If I don't figure out
how to hide this,

758
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:27,534
I'm gonna lose my family.

759
00:38:27,534 --> 00:38:30,601
Trinity has the answer.

760
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:34,300
He's kept his family close.
Even after death.

761
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:48,067
Who did you lose, Arthur?

762
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:10,501
1959. 16.

763
00:39:10,501 --> 00:39:12,634
Vera Mitchell.

764
00:39:12,634 --> 00:39:15,567
Sister of Arthur Mitchell.

765
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:16,667
Found dead in a...

766
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,667
Bathtub.

767
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,334
Marsha Mitchell.

768
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:28,601
1961. 40.

769
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:31,367
Jumped to her death
off the Collins canal bridge.

770
00:39:34,934 --> 00:39:37,133
Henry Mitchell.

771
00:39:37,133 --> 00:39:39,701
1964. 45.

772
00:39:39,701 --> 00:39:42,701
Died in an alley
of a fatal head wound.

773
00:39:52,534 --> 00:39:54,701
Sister, mother, father.

774
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:56,434
He's recreating their deaths.

775
00:39:56,434 --> 00:39:57,901
Decade after decade.

776
00:39:57,901 --> 00:40:01,033
Cycles of three.

777
00:40:04,868 --> 00:40:07,701
I watched my mother get sawed
into pieces.

778
00:40:07,701 --> 00:40:11,200
Now I cut people up.

779
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:14,601
We both have skeletons,

780
00:40:14,601 --> 00:40:17,601
which means we both get a closet
to keep them in.

781
00:40:21,868 --> 00:40:24,434
Arthur has a closet.

782
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:28,667
I know almost everything
about you, Arthur,

783
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:30,267
except where you hide.

784
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:33,334
Ready or not,
here I come.

785
00:41:18,133 --> 00:41:20,734
- Oh, my goodness.
Kyle, you all right?

786
00:41:20,734 --> 00:41:22,567
- Yeah, I cut myself
at the build.

787
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:23,634
I didn't think
it was a big deal,

788
00:41:23,634 --> 00:41:24,667
but it won't stop bleeding.

789
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:28,033
- Here.

790
00:41:30,033 --> 00:41:32,033
- Right out in the open.

791
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:34,000
There must be more
he's hiding inside.

792
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,434
- Come on in.

793
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:39,133
We got a first aid Kit
in the house.

794
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:42,367
Sorry.

795
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:44,267
No boots in the house.

796
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,100
Here, I'll get the Kit.

797
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,534
You make yourself
at home.

798
00:41:48,534 --> 00:41:50,834
- Thanks.
I will.

799
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,734
Tacky, but normal.

800
00:42:02,734 --> 00:42:05,634
His secrets must be
under lock and key.

801
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:19,200
Not the dirty laundry
I'm looking for.

802
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,834
Shit.

803
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:32,467
Arthur has a place
to put his lamp.

804
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:42,200
The dates and locations
from Lundy's books.

805
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,267
Arthur's been using
four walls builds

806
00:42:44,267 --> 00:42:46,400
around the country
as a cover to kill.

807
00:42:48,267 --> 00:42:49,901
And these are his trophies.

808
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:53,434
Hanging right up here
on the wall

809
00:42:53,434 --> 00:42:56,501
just like his hammer
in the garage.

810
00:42:56,501 --> 00:42:59,000
His blood slides.

811
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,100
He doesn't need
a secret apartment.

812
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,667
He's hiding in plain sight,

813
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:05,167
right in the center
of his family.

814
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:10,334
I'm the one
who's lurking in the shadows.

815
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:14,767
And here she is,
Arthur's own dark passenger-

816
00:43:14,767 --> 00:43:19,300
his sister vera.

817
00:43:20,868 --> 00:43:22,534
The tank is low,

818
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:25,234
but then, she's been on the road
for 30 years.

819
00:43:25,234 --> 00:43:26,267
- Kyle!

820
00:43:26,267 --> 00:43:27,534
- Hiding in plain sight
is one thing,

821
00:43:27,534 --> 00:43:29,467
but this is your weak spot.

822
00:43:29,467 --> 00:43:31,934
What happens
when it's exposed?

823
00:43:31,934 --> 00:43:35,567
Come out, come out,
whoever you are.

824
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:40,467
- Okay.

825
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:43,734
Let's have a look
at that hand...

826
00:44:00,968 --> 00:44:05,100
Don't... Touch...

827
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,734
My sister.

828
00:44:06,734 --> 00:44:08,267
- I'm sorry.

829
00:44:08,267 --> 00:44:11,167
I didn't know.

830
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:12,234
I can't breathe.

831
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:20,767
- I'm sorry.

832
00:44:23,968 --> 00:44:25,467
- Forgive me.
I'm so sorry.

833
00:44:25,467 --> 00:44:27,467
- Jesus, Arthur,
what the hell was that?

834
00:44:27,467 --> 00:44:31,133
- It's just...

835
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:32,634
My sister...

836
00:44:35,734 --> 00:44:37,300
She died
when I was young.

837
00:44:39,634 --> 00:44:41,200
It was very painful
for me.

838
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,234
- I understand.

839
00:44:47,234 --> 00:44:49,534
I've lost people too.

840
00:44:52,067 --> 00:44:53,400
- Yeah.
Have a seat.

841
00:45:05,901 --> 00:45:07,534
- If the ashes
bother you so much,

842
00:45:07,534 --> 00:45:11,367
why do you keep them out?

843
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:14,868
- Because she's
a part of me, Kyle.

844
00:45:14,868 --> 00:45:16,033
Helped make me who I am.

845
00:45:21,067 --> 00:45:25,234
- But if your family
ever saw you so upset...

846
00:45:25,234 --> 00:45:28,100
- They'd understand.

847
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,033
This is my home.

848
00:45:30,033 --> 00:45:31,200
I can be myself here.

849
00:45:34,601 --> 00:45:36,501
- You make it sound easy.

850
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:41,367
I used to push people away

851
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:43,567
because of my past.

852
00:45:43,567 --> 00:45:47,400
Even lost a relationship
over it.

853
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,701
Like you.

854
00:45:50,601 --> 00:45:51,601
- But you changed.

855
00:45:51,601 --> 00:45:54,133
- Yeah, I met Sally,

856
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:56,133
had my kids,

857
00:45:56,133 --> 00:45:59,033
and I realized

858
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:00,133
the only way
it was gonna work

859
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:02,701
is if I jumped in
with both feet.

860
00:46:05,701 --> 00:46:09,701
- Jump in with both feet,
huh?

861
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:14,400
And that saved your family?

862
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:19,934
- Kyle,

863
00:46:19,934 --> 00:46:22,734
my family saved me.

864
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,501
Wait.

865
00:46:33,501 --> 00:46:35,067
I want to give you something.

866
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:47,067
For the next build.

867
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:50,834
I thought you should have
your own tools.

868
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:54,801
It's the least I can do.

869
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:55,901
- Thanks.

870
00:46:55,901 --> 00:46:58,968
For giving me
your murder weapon.

871
00:46:58,968 --> 00:47:01,100
- See you
at the next build then.

872
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,868
- Wouldn't miss it.

873
00:47:02,868 --> 00:47:05,767
I want to be a part
of this family.

874
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:10,701
And I know I need
to jump in with both feet.

875
00:47:10,701 --> 00:47:12,400
- I'm glad, but...

876
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,634
- I want to let you in.

877
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:23,567
Honestly, I don't know...

878
00:47:23,567 --> 00:47:25,567
How.

879
00:47:29,868 --> 00:47:34,100
I never learned.

880
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,701
- No, of course you didn't.

881
00:47:37,801 --> 00:47:39,334
God, I...

882
00:47:39,334 --> 00:47:40,667
I mean,
with your mother and-

883
00:47:40,667 --> 00:47:42,501
- what about his mother?

884
00:47:42,501 --> 00:47:44,734
- She was murdered
right in front of him.

885
00:47:44,734 --> 00:47:46,567
- Wow, that's...

886
00:47:46,567 --> 00:47:48,868
That's quite a history.

887
00:47:53,067 --> 00:47:56,467
- And it shaped who I am.

888
00:47:56,467 --> 00:48:00,701
But I want to change.

889
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:02,634
- Let me ask you a question,
Dexter.

890
00:48:02,634 --> 00:48:05,667
And I'd like you
to be honest.

891
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:06,801
- I'll try.

892
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,100
- Would you say
that you're afraid

893
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,567
to let Rita get close
to you?

894
00:48:13,033 --> 00:48:15,167
- Yes.
- Why?

895
00:48:18,334 --> 00:48:20,234
- Because of my past.

896
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:21,901
- Are you afraid
she'll abandon you?

897
00:48:21,901 --> 00:48:24,767
- Yes.

898
00:48:24,767 --> 00:48:26,267
- But Rita is not your mother.

899
00:48:28,534 --> 00:48:31,701
- No, definitely not,
but if she...

900
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:37,300
Ever sees me
for who I really am...

901
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,033
- Then what?

902
00:48:39,033 --> 00:48:41,067
You think I would leave?

903
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:43,567
- Yes, absolutely.

904
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:45,033
- Oh.

905
00:48:45,033 --> 00:48:47,267
Well, then you've got something
to learn about me.

906
00:48:47,267 --> 00:48:50,767
I married you
because I want to get

907
00:48:50,767 --> 00:48:53,200
to know the real you.

908
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,601
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

909
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:57,634
- Dexter.

910
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:00,667
Tell Rita the truth.

911
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:02,467
Why did you keep
your apartment?

912
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,534
- Because...

913
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:18,133
I need space...

914
00:49:18,133 --> 00:49:22,000
To keep my stuff.

915
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,934
- We have a house.

916
00:49:24,934 --> 00:49:25,968
There's plenty of room.

917
00:49:25,968 --> 00:49:28,467
- I think what Dexter
is trying to say

918
00:49:28,467 --> 00:49:30,234
is that he needs space
for himself

919
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:31,767
in the marriage.

920
00:49:31,767 --> 00:49:33,067
- Okay, yeah,

921
00:49:33,067 --> 00:49:35,868
but I really do need a place

922
00:49:35,868 --> 00:49:37,434
to put my stuff.

923
00:49:37,434 --> 00:49:38,834
- Of course.

924
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:42,100
Of course.
I'll-I'll give you space.

925
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,567
- You will?

926
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:47,167
- Yes.

927
00:49:49,701 --> 00:49:51,200
- See what happens
when you're honest?

928
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,834
You get what you need.

929
00:50:16,501 --> 00:50:18,167
- I know you're here.

930
00:50:23,701 --> 00:50:26,501
- You always catch me.

931
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,300
Mind if I join you?

932
00:51:04,267 --> 00:51:07,701
Look how beautiful you are.

933
00:51:07,701 --> 00:51:08,901
- Mm.

934
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:12,701
I'll never get tired
of hearing that.

935
00:51:37,367 --> 00:51:38,400
- You look better.

936
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:42,501
- I feel better.

937
00:51:42,501 --> 00:51:44,567
You know why?

938
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:45,901
Nikki wald didn't kill Lundy.

939
00:51:47,701 --> 00:51:49,100
- How do you know?

940
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,901
'Cause somebody stole
Lundy's trinity research.

941
00:51:50,901 --> 00:51:52,701
- Me.

942
00:51:52,701 --> 00:51:53,701
- And there's only one person
who'd have a reason

943
00:51:53,701 --> 00:51:55,567
to do that.
- Me?

944
00:51:55,567 --> 00:51:57,100
- Trinity.

945
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,601
- You're kidding.

946
00:51:58,601 --> 00:52:01,934
- He must have realized
Lundy was getting close.

947
00:52:01,934 --> 00:52:04,567
Think about it.
That newspaper article.

948
00:52:04,567 --> 00:52:06,901
Maybe he even saw Lundy staking
out that office building.

949
00:52:06,901 --> 00:52:09,167
- I guess.

950
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,300
- He killed Lundy,
he shot me,

951
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,434
he stole Lundy's books
to cover his ass.

952
00:52:13,434 --> 00:52:15,901
- Not exactly,
but you were on a roll there

953
00:52:15,901 --> 00:52:17,000
for a while.

954
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,834
- Do you know
how awesome this is?

955
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:20,300
It means that cocksucker
is still out there,

956
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,400
and I don't have
to sit around and wait

957
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,901
for someone else
to take care of it.

958
00:52:22,901 --> 00:52:24,534
I can get him.

959
00:52:24,534 --> 00:52:25,701
- Great,
now I've got to worry

960
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:27,968
about you getting
on trinity's radar.

961
00:52:27,968 --> 00:52:29,200
- Have you told laguerta
your theory?

962
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,467
- Not yet.

963
00:52:30,467 --> 00:52:32,067
I need to make sure
I have a case first.

964
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:33,067
I don't want to step
on my Dick.

965
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:36,667
- No, definitely not.

966
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:38,267
- I got to get
to the station.

967
00:52:38,267 --> 00:52:39,534
Lots of work to do.

968
00:52:39,534 --> 00:52:41,901
By the way...

969
00:52:41,901 --> 00:52:43,601
I think I know
who dad was fucking.

970
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:47,501
- What?
Wait, who?

971
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:49,467
- I'll tell you
when I know more.

972
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:51,968
I don't want to step on my Dick
with that either.

973
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:02,501
- So you ready?

974
00:53:08,767 --> 00:53:11,167
- I was born
of primordial ooze.

975
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:13,501
I crawled out
of my own mother's blood.

976
00:53:15,834 --> 00:53:18,834
I hid among the humans,
hoping not to be seen.

977
00:53:18,834 --> 00:53:20,300
But somewhere along the way,

978
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,767
I grew legs,

979
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:26,834
stood upright.

980
00:53:26,834 --> 00:53:28,567
Would you give me a hand?

981
00:53:28,567 --> 00:53:30,200
- Absolutely.

982
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:39,434
So what do you think?

983
00:53:39,434 --> 00:53:41,334
Is it too stuffy?

984
00:53:41,334 --> 00:53:45,868
- Nope.

985
00:53:52,267 --> 00:53:54,033
It's perfect.

986
00:53:54,033 --> 00:53:55,868
Thank you.

987
00:53:55,868 --> 00:53:57,200
I became a husband,

988
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,200
a father.

989
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,534
I had to evolve.

990
00:54:00,534 --> 00:54:02,167
It was the only way
to survive.

991
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:06,667
- I have something else
I want to give you.

992
00:54:06,667 --> 00:54:08,634
- Being myself
in front of my family

993
00:54:08,634 --> 00:54:10,200
will take
some getting used to,

994
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,200
but Arthur was right.

995
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,868
It does feel... Good.

996
00:54:18,267 --> 00:54:20,701
- Got it.

997
00:54:20,701 --> 00:54:22,033
- A padlock?

998
00:54:22,033 --> 00:54:23,100
- For the door.

999
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,334
To keep it locked.

1000
00:54:25,334 --> 00:54:27,334
- Shouldn't I leave it open?

1001
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:30,734
- Please,
we have three young children.

1002
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,467
There's dangerous stuff
in there.
