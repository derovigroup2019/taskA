<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

2
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,712
Do you know where you are?

3
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:55,214
- Ambulance. What happened?
- You were in an accident.

4
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,350
Bad news is that
you sustained a concussion.

5
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,218
I'd like to keep you
here for observation.

6
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,854
Dexter, oh my God!

7
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,106
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

8
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:05,358
Just a little fender bender.

9
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:06,792
Doc says I'm good to go.

10
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,027
You got a minute?

11
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,812
I'd, uh,
like to pick your brain.

12
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:13,199
Lisa Bell?
The girl in the bathtub.

13
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,433
Of course.

14
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:16,702
The Trinity killer's
most recent victim.

15
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,120
Trinity is going to kill again.

16
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:21,073
Another woman,
older than Lisa Bell this time.

17
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,575
But the person that you should really
be talking to is my sister.

18
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,543
She's lead on Lisa Bell.

19
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,962
You sure that's a good call?
Given our history.

20
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,614
I wouldn't want to mislead you.

21
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:32,168
What I have with Anton...
It's-It's great.

22
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,886
I fucking love you.

23
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,089
The reason I'm in Miami
is because I'm convinced

24
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:40,843
these bathtub murders are
connected to a series or murders

25
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,178
all over the country.

26
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,346
Christ.
I'm an idiot.

27
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,848
Debra!

28
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,600
Tell me again this isn't crazy.

29
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,102
Crazy good.

30
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,905
I brought you a copy of my article.

31
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,157
A string of robberies turned
deadly in what authorities

32
00:02:55,192 --> 00:02:56,942
are now calling
the vacation murder.

33
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,994
I found your guy.
Name's Johnny Rose.

00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:01,113
Briefing room in five minutes.
Strategy meeting.

35
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,449
Dexter's turned up a lead on our shooter.

36
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:09,839
Don't sweat it, Quinn.

37
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:12,374
I've got much bigger things to worry about.

38
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:13,843
I thought it was a fender bender.

39
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:16,262
I'm sure there's a bent fender
somewhere in this mess.

40
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,797
Oh, my God.

41
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,632
Rita,
what are you doing here?

42
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,218
You lied to me, Dexter.

43
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:27,840

Dexter s04e03: "Blinded By The Light"

45
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,780
The backyard barbecue.

46
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:38,617
It's a holdover from the last ice age
when food was scarce,

47
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:42,538
and men had to work together
to take down such a large beast.

48
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,158
Those who worked well with others survived,

49
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,711
and their genes have been passed
down through the centuries.

50
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:50,913
Until they landed here-

51
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,415
In this...

52
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,050
My community.

53
00:03:55,085 --> 00:04:01,008
[latin music]

54
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:15,104
[drumming]

55
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:18,240
Soda?

56
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:20,392
Whatever.

57
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:26,448
How 'bout you?

58
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,201
I'm good.

59
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,921
Ah, wasted youth.

60
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:36,125
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

61
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:39,628
Yeah.

62
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,214
I just got off the phone
with Dr. Montgomery,

63
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,184
the doctor that took care
of you after your accident.

64
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,852
Oh, right.

65
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,021
Why didn't you tell me
you had a concussion?

66
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,689
I just wanted to keep you from worrying.

67
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,358
You already have so much to deal with.

68
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,727
The doctor also told you
that you weren't supposed to drive

69
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,562
for the next ten days,
and you didn't listen.

70
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,647
So I will now be doing
all your driving.

71
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,316
I will take you to work
in the morning,

72
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,934
and I will pick you up
at the end of the day.

73
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:03,736
- Rita, I'm perfectly capable-
- Dexter.

74
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,539
The past few weeks, you have not been

75
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,408
the most present father and husband.

76
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,744
Remember.
We're a team here, right?

77
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:16,081
Okay, we work together.

78
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,282
She's right.

79
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,951
Maybe now's the time to turn that around.

80
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:20,469
Score a few points.

81
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:22,421
Which will then make Rita
more likely to say yes

82
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,007
when I need a little time for myself.

83
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,093
You're right.
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,846
Thank you.
Let's go eat.

85
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,570
So I guess you saw somebody
bashed in Kate's birdbath.

86
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,738
I know, that's awful.

87
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,991
Poor birds.

88
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:44,193
And poor Kate.

89
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,527
Why would someone do such a thing?

90
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:46,812
The same reason he knocked over

91
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,080
the Andersons' water fountain,

92
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,449
pulled down the Garcias' basketball hoop

93
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,784
and spray-painted
the Schwarzs' trash cans.

94
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,035
'Cause he's a dick.

95
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,954
He knocked the sea horse
off my mailbox, too.

96
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,922
I hated that sea horse.

97
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,508
Well, your mom picked it out.

98
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,630
- You know Andy.
- Uh, yeah, of course.

99
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,716
Hi, how are you doing?
Hey, Jess, Jess, Jess?

100
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,435
Do you really need to be doing that?

101
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,186
Yeah, I really do.

102
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:14,473
His wife passed away last year.

103
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,526
So, uh,
so about this neighborhood vandal.

104
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,695
We all need to work together
to deal with this guy.

105
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,614
The last thing we need
is a dangerous presence

106
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:22,815
in our neighborhood.

107
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,316
You know,
it's a funny thing, Dexter.

108
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,986
This all started to happen
time you moved in.

109
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,322
A little suspicious,
don't you think?

110
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,707
I'm just busting your chops.

111
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:34,209
Oh.
[chuckling]

112
00:06:34,244 --> 00:06:35,995
My chops are busted.

113
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,548
The danger of community is that
the people who don't belong

114
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:41,133
are looked upon with suspicion.

115
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,420
Those of us who prefer to work by ourselves,

116
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,972
the lone wolves,
risk being singled out.

117
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,475
Cody. what's that?

118
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,143
Waah!

119
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,313
[laughing]

120
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,347
I'm gonna get you!

121
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:56,398
Oh, I'm scared!

122
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:59,852
So I become an expert at blending in,

123
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:03,772
camouflaging myself,
becoming one of the guys.

124
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,074
Astor, what's that?

125
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,909
Ahh!

126
00:07:06,943 --> 00:07:08,193
Oh, my God.

127
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,245
Dexter!

128
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,865
I'm so humiliated.

129
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,867
What were you thinking?

130
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,337
She was wearing a bathing suit.

131
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,590
This blending in thing
isn't as easy as it looks.

132
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:24,593
[eerie music]

133
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:29,098
[indistinct sobbing]

134
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,973
We're here.

135
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,976
Stop right here.

136
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:49,284
That's okay.

137
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:55,908
Oh!

138
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,244
Oh, God, please.
Don't hurt me!

139
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,164
Oh, God! Oh, God!

140
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:14,343
Don't do anything stupid.

141
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,233
Careful, now.

142
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,301
Wouldn't want to hurt yourself.

143
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,318
It's pretty, isn't it?

144
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:46,125
Okay, now.
It's time for you to jump.

145
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,794
What?

146
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:49,928
God, no.

147
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,381
Yes.
It always ends like this.

148
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,382
No, but-

149
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,884
Shh.

150
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:59,438
It's already over.

151
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,890
Why are you doing this to me?

152
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,692
You know
I'm not to blame here.

153
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:05,177
[sobbing]

154
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:06,612
Come on, now.

155
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,534
Please, no!

156
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:16,205
Now you just need to let go...

157
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,956
and fall.

158
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,491
Please, I'll do anything.

159
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,526
- Good. Jump.
- No, I can't!

160
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:24,546
- You can.
- I have children!

161
00:09:24,581 --> 00:09:26,548
I know.
Jason and Susie.

162
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:27,716
[groaning]

163
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,201
If you like,
I can swing by your house,

164
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:31,920
Put an ice pick in your husband's head,

165
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,506
and bring your kids back,
and throw them off one at a time

166
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,926
until you finally decide to jump.

167
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,145
Is that what you want?

168
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,184
Please...

169
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,436
What?

170
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,021
Please.

171
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,273
Just push me.

172
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,779
It doesn't work that way.

173
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,167
Jump.

174
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,460
[screaming]

175
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:12,794
[thud]

176
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:28,093
Oh... Mommy.

177
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,863
You've only been here a month,

178
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,248
and they've already got you tagged.

179
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,983
It's not just me.
There are other houses.

180
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,668
Dex, we've been through this before.

181
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:28,370
11th grade.

182
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,372

And you made me clean it up.

184
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,594
Because it raised questions, Dexter.

185
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,297
It would have made people
think, "Why this kid? Why him?"

186
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,766
You can't afford to have people
asking those questions.

Did you predict this jumper?

00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:43,748
Here, have a whistle
and a head flashlight.

362
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:48,002
It'll keep your hands free
when you're out patrolling.

363
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:50,755
Patrolling?
We're patrolling?

364
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,842
Your job is to watch and report,
watch and report.

365
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:56,678
- Watch and report.
- You got it.

366
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:59,180
[laughing]

367
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:01,015
Community college for me now.

368
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,435
Hey, Dexter, our neighborhood
beautification association

369
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:06,304
Asked me to give this to you.
I'm the secretary.

370
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,856
It's a warning against
the graffiti on your gate.

371
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,808
I know it's silly,
but they want you to repaint.

372
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:10,975
Hey, Dex.

373
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,644
I guess you saw the new
motion-detector lights

374
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,146
I just put in.

375
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,865
Sure are bright.

376
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:18,450
Yeah, brightest I could get.

377
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:20,902
Made sure I angled one
right on your place, too.

378
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,488
That's very neighborly of you.

379
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,156
We have to look out for each other.

380
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,375
Yeah, this guy started off small,
a few broken windows,

381
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:29,828
Andy's mailbox,
but yesterday he broke into

382
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,546
the Walkers' guest house
and trashed the place.

383
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,215
Yeah, next thing he'll be
stealing our women.

384
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,584
Can't let him steal our women,
now, can we?

385
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,504
No, they're our women.

386
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:40,755
[laughing]

387
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,007
- Is that the sign-up sheet?
- Yeah, yeah.

388
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,059
See, we're setting up patrols
for every night of the week.

389
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:46,711
I'm good for every night
but Wednesday.

390
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:48,513
I got a poker night at the Lodge.

391
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,315
Great.

392
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,568
No one will come in or out
of this neighborhood unnoticed.

393
00:20:53,602 --> 00:20:55,019
Including me.

394
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,771
It's not the neighborhood vandal
I'm worried about.

395
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,407
It's the neighborhood watch.

396
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:04,329
Hmm, graffiti.

397
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,698
Excuse me.

398
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,083
So I was all set to go to the
University of Miami next year

399
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:11,252
till my dad decided
to get himself laid off.

400
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:13,121
That blows.

401
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,089
How about you, Jesse?

402
00:21:15,124 --> 00:21:17,709
You want to sign up for
the neighborhood watch?

403
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,127
Sounds kind of lame.

404
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:23,681
So lame.

405
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:27,352
Paint can, soda can...
I'm thinking fingerprints.

406
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,221
Let me get that for you.

407
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:33,224
And I know one little lady
who is up past her bedtime.

408
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,360
Mom!

409
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:41,649
Dexter, you can't treat her
like a little girl anymore.

410
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,819
I can't?

411
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:48,790
Hey, Dex.

412
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:50,992
Hey, Elliot.

413
00:22:04,974 --> 00:22:06,641
Have a nice day!

414
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,073
You knew this day would come, Dexter.

415
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,741
You've always been good with kids,

416
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,443
but eventually they grow up.

417
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,029
They become more mature,

418
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,865
develop complex emotions that
just aren't in your skill set.

419
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,117
Astor's becoming a whole person,
and you're...

420
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,702
Something less.

421
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,671
I hope you're not taking
any of this seriously.

422
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:39,674
The wife, the kids,
the house in the 'burbs.

423
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:43,044
It's all great camouflage,
but that's all it is.

424
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,929
It's gotten more complicated than that.

425
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,798
Then uncomplicate it.

426
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,633
You need to realize your limitations.

427
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,969
Remember exactly who you are.

428
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,938
Probably should have used
something a little darker.

429
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,441
It's fine, dad.
Nothing's gonna show through.

430
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:59,944
I hope not, Dex.
For your sake.

431
00:23:03,032 --> 00:23:04,232
Hey, you ready to go?

432
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:05,400
Almost.

433
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:08,453
I've got the best of Bananarama.

434
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,571
It's a cruel summer.

435
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,210
As long as the neighborhood vandal

436
00:23:16,245 --> 00:23:19,380
keeps my neighbors on edge,
I will have no privacy.

437
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,339
And I'm not going to let you
do that to me, Jesse.

438
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:35,313
Tarla Grant, married, mother of two.

439
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,065
It fits.

440
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:39,100
- It fits what?
- Lundy's theory.

441
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,069
That she's another victim
of the serial killer.

442
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:43,354
Yes.

443
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,189
What?

444
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:46,941
His whole life is about serial killers.

445
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,860
That's all he thinks about,
so of course he thinks

446
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:50,244
she was killed by a serial killer.

447
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:52,664
I think he's
a little smarter than that.

448
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,615
I'm sure you do,
otherwise you wouldn't be

449
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,501
sitting at your desk going
through 30-year-old files

450
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:57,502
all afternoon.

451
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,236
Oh, yeah, guess what.

452
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:01,622
So are you.

453
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:03,925
Just unsealed the juvey
records of Johnny Rose,

454
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,593
our vacation murder suspect.

455
00:24:05,627 --> 00:24:07,045
Anything?

456
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,081
Shoplifting with his high
school girlfriend, Nikki Wald.

457
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:12,767
That was like, what,
ten years ago?

458
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,268
You think they're still in touch?

459
00:24:14,303 --> 00:24:16,054
Since she testified against him back then,

460
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,889
I'd say extremely unlikely.

461
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,225
Well, at this point, I think
we need to take any shot we can.

462
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,095
She lives in Oakland Park.
I'll drive out there with you.

463
00:24:24,113 --> 00:24:26,097
Let's go.

464
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:32,320
That seem accidental and unplanned to you?

465
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,605
Even I believed it.

466
00:24:34,623 --> 00:24:37,375
I was thinking we could stop
somewhere for lunch first.

467
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:41,662
I know a little place where
we can order some room service.

468
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:44,966
Okay, here we go.
30 years ago to the week.

469
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,720
Female, caucasian, 36, mother of two.

470
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:51,089
Jumped to her death off the same warehouse.

471
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:53,641
The woman's family insisted
she was the victim of foul play,

472
00:24:53,675 --> 00:24:56,094
but it was ruled a suicide.

473
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,562
Doesn't mean fuck-all.

474
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,097
Someone fell or jumped off

475
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:01,065
the same warehouse eight years ago.

476
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,401
Someone else jumped off
a ship loading crane

477
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,269
on the same Pier back in '86,

478
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,688
and another body washed up on the rocks

479
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,408
right in front of the warehouse
only two years ago.

480
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,026
Nobody knows how it got there.

481
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,945
This is Miami, Deb.
People die.

482
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:17,448
And sometimes it's by murder.
I want to follow up on this.

483
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,618
Okay, Tarla Grant seemed to have
a pretty decent life.

484
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,538
No apparent reason for suicide,
so keep it open for now.

485
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:25,656
Fuckin' a we'll keep it open.

486
00:25:25,674 --> 00:25:28,593
I'd know that foul mouth anywhere.

487
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,962
Anton, what are you doing here?

488
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,346
I love you too, baby.

489
00:25:32,381 --> 00:25:33,631
Come on, let's have some lunch.

490
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,216
I have a fuckload of work to do.

491
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:41,439
All right.

492
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:44,609
All right, but it's a working lunch.

493
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,061
Ah, solitude.

494
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,947
Something I won't enjoy again
until I deal with Jesse,

495
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:52,150
the neighborhood shithead.

496
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,522
- Hey, Dexter.
- Hey.

497
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,792
Dexter, I was looking for you.

498
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:02,960
Hello, Debra.

499
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,830
- Hi.
- May I?

500
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:09,667
Yeah.

501
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,968
Frank Lundy.

502
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:11,969
Anton Briggs.

503
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:14,505
My lover-

504
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,390
Friend.
My boyfriend.

505
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:19,594
All of the above.

506
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:22,263
So, Dexter,
I was wondering if you'd gotten

507
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:25,483
the blood tox results back
on Tarla Grant yet?

508
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,518
Yeah,
I should check on that right away.

509
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,487
Please, finish your lunch.

510
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,323
All done.

511
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:36,444
Tarla Grant,
just like you said: 36 years old,

512
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,162
married, mother of two.

513
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,530
That's a shame.

514
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,583
I found the matching 30-year-old case.

515
00:26:42,618 --> 00:26:44,085
What's that?

516
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:46,087
Big case we're working on.

517
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:49,674
I'm afraid I've enlisted Debra
in another of my mad theories.

518
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,927
Ah.

519
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:54,295
What's it all about?

520
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,348
Finding out who killed her.

521
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,433
Oh.

522
00:26:59,468 --> 00:27:01,686
I don't suppose you happened
to bring the, uh-

523
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,355
30-year-old file?

524
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,807
Read the husband's statement
from 30 years ago.

525
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:10,111
Family never believed it was a suicide.

526
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:12,446
But since Trinity never leaves a trace,

527
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:15,700
there was nothing to investigate.

528
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:23,407
You give good room service, Angel.

529
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:25,626
You know, we should do
lunch out more often.

530
00:27:25,661 --> 00:27:29,213
Missed one.

531
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:31,782
[giggles]

532
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,951
No arrests since she got busted

533
00:27:33,969 --> 00:27:35,286
with Rose back in high school.

534
00:27:35,304 --> 00:27:37,004
Spotty job record,
but that's about it.

535
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,556
It's a stretch, I know.

536
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:45,846
[knock on door]

537
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,265
Nikki?

538
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:52,270
Nikki Wald?

539
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:55,273
I'm not sure Miss Nikki Wald is home.

540
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,693
Okay.

541
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,248
Hey, I'm Sergeant Batista
from Miami Metro homicide.

542
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,316
It's Rose.

543
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:06,334
Get down!

544
00:28:06,368 --> 00:28:12,173
[gunshots]

545
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:14,491
Shots fired, 41st and Andrews.
We need backup!

546
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:15,927
- Good?
- Yeah, I'm good, let's go.

547
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:28,105
Suspects Johnny Rose
and Nikki Wald going northbound

548
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,608
on 41st street in a white sedan.

549
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,509
- I think it was gray.
- A light-colored sedan.

550
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:33,677
Make? Model?

551
00:28:33,695 --> 00:28:36,680
Suspects are armed and dangerous.

552
00:28:42,738 --> 00:28:45,156
Rita thinks I'm with
the neighborhood watch.

553
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,076
Truth is, I'm gonna do
a little more than watch.

554
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:53,581
There's dad,
off to his weekly poker game.

555
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,717
[car ignition starts]

556
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:02,539
And if I were the delinquent son,

557
00:29:02,557 --> 00:29:06,143
I would take advantage
of my father's absence.

558
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:10,181
Going after him feels very familiar,

559
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,434
except it won't have
its usual satisfying ending.

560
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:16,570
The best I can do is scare
a little sense into this kid.

561
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,529
Hey!

562
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:26,947
Come on, it's the vandal.
Let's get him!

563
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:30,034
Oh, fuck.

564
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,929
It's watch and report, assholes.

565
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:44,715
Not watch and chase.

566
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,684
This is so humiliating.

567
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,055
Go that way.

568
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,421
This neighborhood's gonna kill me.

569
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:31,979
Already? I mean, the kids
aren't even dressed yet.

570
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:33,347
I know, I know, I'm early.

571
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,600
Just wanted you to see
the latest work of the vandal.

572
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,489
Happened in the middle of the night.

573
00:30:41,523 --> 00:30:44,942
He obviously smashed the window,
released the emergency brake,

574
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:48,279
Gave it a shove, and,
uh, let it roll.

575
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,997
So dangerous.

576
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:52,416
Is that Cody's bike?

577
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:53,868
Oh, my God.

578
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,337
What if he had been out here playing?

579
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:08,716
These dummies share the same
size and weight distribution

580
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:09,967
as our victim.

581
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:13,020
At this height,
any variant in trajectory

582
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:16,023
resulting from a simple jump
or being pushed off the building

583
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:17,725
will be evident in where they land.

584
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:21,395
What if she took a running leap?

585
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:23,030
People don't kill themselves that way.

586
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:24,365
They just let go.

587
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,351
Oh, hey, either of you
interested in buying tickets

588
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:28,986
to the Dolphins game?
Club level?

589
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,121
I'll let them go for 500 bucks.

590
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:31,705
- Where'd you get those?
- Dexter.

591
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,990
Son of a bitch.

592
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,858
Come on,
we have dummies to drop.

593
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:38,546
Is he gonna pay me for those?

594
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,414
Must be weird for you-

595
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:41,916
Lundy coming back.

596
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:43,717
Why would it be weird?
You're weird.

597
00:31:43,752 --> 00:31:45,836
None of my business, I know.

598
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,590
But... if I loved someone,

599
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,509
and that person was gone,

600
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,811
and then I moved on,
and then found someone else,

601
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,879
and then that first person
all of a sudden showed up again,

602
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:59,150
I don't know-
I've never had that problem.

603
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,769
But it's gotta be a little confusing.

604
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,721
Maybe.

605
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:06,941
A little.

606
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:08,943
So then maybe if you know
that it's supposed to be

607
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,327
weird and confusing,

608
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,663
then maybe it's
a little easier to handle.

609
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,783
Thanks.

610
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:18,402
It's always the same
three kills with Trinity-

611
00:32:18,587 --> 00:32:21,589
A young woman in a bathtub,

612
00:32:21,623 --> 00:32:25,209
followed by a mother
falling to her death,

613
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,845
and ending with a man
getting bludgeoned.

614
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,464
I put her in a short shirt
so that we can see her panties

615
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,017
while she's falling.

616
00:32:35,937 --> 00:32:37,938
Specific.

617
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,142
How many times that you know of?

618
00:32:42,277 --> 00:32:44,394
I've got the bits and pieces

619
00:32:44,446 --> 00:32:47,398
that add up to at least 15 cycles.

620
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:51,368
Since we just turned the clock
back another 15 years,

621
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:54,438
I'm sure there are considerably more.

622
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:57,658
Wow.

623
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:58,993
That's impressive.

624
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:04,948
In a very evil way.

625
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:11,055
What's really impressive
is that I can't prove a thing.

626
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,789
Could never get anyone
at the Bureau convinced.

627
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:14,058
He's that good.

628
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,726
Why do you think he's so successful?

629
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:21,131
Trinity's likely someone
who's gone his own solitary way

630
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:22,633
through life,

631
00:33:22,651 --> 00:33:24,735
So preoccupied with his own obsessions

632
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:28,188
that he's foregone all but
the most rudimentary

633
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,307
of human connections.

634
00:33:30,325 --> 00:33:32,993
A lone wolf.

635
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:34,495
Exactly.

636
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,148
It's a little bit disturbing.

637
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,533
Yeah.

638
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,002
I mean...
I could just as well

639
00:33:42,037 --> 00:33:45,372
be talking about myself.

640
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,174
Sure, I've been married.

641
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:50,711
Was married for 29 years, happily.

642
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,796
But even so,

643
00:33:53,174 --> 00:33:56,267
the only thing that
really got my heart beating

644
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:58,218
was the hunt.

645
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,803
I'm sure you can't relate.

646
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:02,690
No, sorry.

647
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:05,693
And now here I am at 60,

648
00:34:05,694 --> 00:34:08,195
watching dummies fly off a roof,

649
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,448
still on the hunt.

650
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,901
It sounds like Trinity
is a worthy prey.

651
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:16,520
What's really got me intrigued

652
00:34:16,538 --> 00:34:21,458
is the notion
that he's returned to Miami.

653
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:24,211
He's come home.

654
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:28,307
I'm not sure "home"
is the right word.

655
00:34:28,342 --> 00:34:32,369
People like us
don't really belong anywhere.

656
00:34:32,387 --> 00:34:35,589
We just pass through.

657
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:44,992
Drink up.

658
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,948
You're next.

659
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,310
The vacation murders.

660
00:36:03,344 --> 00:36:06,296
Word is, you know who
Johnny Rose's accomplice is.

661
00:36:06,314 --> 00:36:08,065
Forget it, you'll get
the press release same time

662
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,566
as everyone else.

663
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,402
But my Sergeant and Lieutenant
were almost killed yesterday,

664
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:14,321
So if you put any negative spin on it,
I'll be very angry.

665
00:36:14,355 --> 00:36:16,807
When you're angry, you're very sexy,

666
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:19,660
so this could be
sort of a win-win for me.

667
00:36:19,694 --> 00:36:21,745
Let's just say I'll be angry
in a very withholding

668
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,913
sort of way.

669
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,248
Okay.

670
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,750
- The bathtub murder?
- Still under investigation.

671
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:29,620
The jumper at the old Port building?

672
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:30,821
Ditto.

673
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:33,123
I gotta run.
See you tonight?

674
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,541
Sure.

675
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,326
Can you just go over
the figures one more time?

676
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:37,961
They're not gonna change.

677
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:40,330
The test results indicate that
Tarla Grant jumped,

678
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:41,849
rather than was pushed.
I don't buy it.

679
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:43,183
I think we're looking at a murder victim.

680
00:36:43,218 --> 00:36:44,435
Deb, we also got the autopsy report.

681
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:45,769
She had a small tumor.

682
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:48,272
Talked to the husband.
They just found out last week.

683
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,442
Maybe she was taking the easy way out.

684
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:53,377
Maybe she was determined to fight it.

685
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:55,279
That doesn't mean she killed herself.

686
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:56,947
I checked her cell phone records.

687
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,949
No text messages,
no suicide note.

688
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:01,568
Not everyone leaves a note.

689
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:02,903
I just got word.

690
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,738
We will be debriefed
on our shooting incident

691
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,039
in the morning.

692
00:37:06,074 --> 00:37:08,208
Okay, good.

693
00:37:08,243 --> 00:37:09,710
We need to get our stories straight

694
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:11,328
about why we left the precinct at 12:30

695
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:14,465
and didn't get to Wald's
apartment until after 3:00.

696
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:17,668
We grabbed some lunch
and then we had a flat tire.

697
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,920
Flat tire it is.

698
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:22,723
You okay?

699
00:37:22,757 --> 00:37:24,708
I've read Masuka's notes.

700
00:37:24,726 --> 00:37:26,643
That, along with the autopsy reports,

701
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:28,378
leads me to believe that
there's no reason

702
00:37:28,396 --> 00:37:30,564
to keep Tarla's case open
as a murder investigation.

703
00:37:30,598 --> 00:37:33,100
Lieutenant, I think
it's premature to close it.

704
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:35,018
- Lundy has this theory-
- You don't work for Lundy.

705
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:38,388
You're welcome to pursue this,
but between the vacation murders

706
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:42,609
and Lisa Bell, I think
you're gonna be very busy.

707
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,244
You're on your own with this one.

708
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:46,363
Poor Cody.

709
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,583
Ouch.

710
00:37:49,617 --> 00:37:51,451
Where'd the glass come from?

711
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:52,669
That car on Elliot's lawn.

712
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:54,204
Cody was coming back from their pool,

713
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:56,290
and he stepped on a piece.

714
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:58,125
Does he need stitches?

715
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:00,010
No, he's fine,
he's just scared.

716
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,762
First his bike, now this.

717
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:04,748
Poor guy.
Give him a hug for me.

718
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,270
Hi.

719
00:38:10,305 --> 00:38:12,088
Help me out here, Dexter.

720
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:13,941
I've been going out of my way
trying to make things good

721
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:15,751
with you,
but no matter what I do,

722
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:17,528
you just throw it back in my face.

723
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:21,031
You don't need to make
things good with me.

724
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,617
Come on,
what's it gonna take?

725
00:38:23,651 --> 00:38:26,269
Quinn...

726
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:29,039
I don't care if you're a dirty cop.

727
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:33,043
If I didn't take that money,
it would just sit

728
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,578
inside a locker until some fatass

729
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,830
who sits behind a desk
grabs it to buy new carpet

730
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,332
for his office which he never leaves.

731
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:39,800
I put my life on the line every day.

732
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:41,802
I give this job everything I've got,

733
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:43,804
and I can't even afford
a down payment on a condo.

734
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:46,006
I thought you had family money.

735
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,674
Had, and that has nothing
to do with anything.

736
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:49,893
Just don't fucking call me dirty.

737
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:52,229
The last thing I need
is a cop mad at me.

738
00:38:55,733 --> 00:39:00,320
Look, you're right,
I take it all back.

739
00:39:00,355 --> 00:39:04,457
I honestly
don't give a shit.

740
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:07,945
Just keep my sister out of it,
okay?

741
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:13,283
You don't understand any of this,
do you?

742
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:16,587
You can't,

743
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:20,123
'cause you're not a cop.

744
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,092
You're not one of us.

745
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,377
[sigh]

746
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:26,046
Cops... Another community I'm not part of.

747
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:43,030
[exhales]

748
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,367
What?

749
00:39:47,402 --> 00:39:50,404
It's so crowded in there.

750
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:53,040
Well, I guess so.
A wife and three kids.

751
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,695
They're always there.

752
00:39:58,713 --> 00:40:00,881
Tell me about it.

753
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:04,468
It was easy living with Anton
when he was never home.

754
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,470
I'd come back to a quiet apartment

755
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,972
and unwind without having
to deal with anybody.

756
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:11,041
Now, as soon as I walk through the door,
he's there,

757
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:12,726
waiting to engage.

758
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,144
There's no escape.

759
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:19,016
And now Lundy shows up.

760
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:22,853
Is that good or bad?

761
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:26,273
I have no fucking clue.

762
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:30,027
- [giggles]
- What?

763
00:40:30,741 --> 00:40:32,913
We're complaining because
people want to be with us?

764
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,699
How lame is that?

765
00:40:36,863 --> 00:40:39,369
You think Tarla Grant killed herself?

766
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:43,573
No, I don't.

767
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:47,577
Masuka said she wasn't thrown
or pushed from the building.

768
00:40:47,595 --> 00:40:52,516
She jumped.
What would make her do that?

769
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,552
Fear is a powerful motivator.

770
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,093
You should go inside.
You're home.

771
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,780
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

772
00:41:15,156 --> 00:41:17,407
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.

773
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,658
Where is everybody?

774
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,243
I'm in here.

775
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,329
Fort Cody.

776
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:29,503
Hey, buddy, how's your foot?

777
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:30,971
It's better.

778
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:34,758
Good.
Keep holding down the fort.

779
00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:36,309
Okay.

780
00:41:36,344 --> 00:41:38,678
And I'll take care of my end

781
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,814
once you guys go to sleep tonight.

782
00:41:40,848 --> 00:41:43,400
You may want to talk to Astor.

783
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,688
This is one of those moments
when I wish

784
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,407
I was like everyone else.

785
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,309
I'm sure other people
would know what to say.

786
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,084
Hey.

787
00:42:07,842 --> 00:42:10,043
I know you're not a little kid anymore.

788
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,345
Duh.

789
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,497
I'm sorry.

790
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:18,602
It's just...

791
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:22,505
Sometimes I'm...

792
00:42:22,523 --> 00:42:24,141
Dumb.

793
00:42:31,566 --> 00:42:35,068
It's okay.

794
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,121
You can be dumb.

795
00:42:42,043 --> 00:42:43,543
[sighs]
Thanks.

796
00:43:02,096 --> 00:43:04,097
What?

797
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:09,385
It's funny.

798
00:43:09,403 --> 00:43:12,105
A few months ago,
after a shoot-up like this,

799
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,241
people saw me leaning against you,

800
00:43:14,276 --> 00:43:15,525
they wouldn't think twice.

801
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,560
They still wouldn't think twice.

802
00:43:17,578 --> 00:43:19,162
They don't know anything about us.

803
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:21,898
I know.

804
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:24,083
But I think twice.

805
00:43:24,118 --> 00:43:28,421
I'm constantly worried that
people will misinterpret.

806
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,797
Let them misinterpret.

807
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:43,253
Hey...

808
00:43:43,271 --> 00:43:45,355
I need this as much as you do.

809
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:51,094
This Dexter guy.

810
00:43:51,112 --> 00:43:53,697
First of all, who the fuck
is named Dexter?

811
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,782
[groaning]

812
00:43:55,816 --> 00:43:57,984
Oh, that feels good.

813
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,436
What, did his parents know
he was gonna grow up

814
00:44:00,454 --> 00:44:02,605
to be a fucking egghead?

815
00:44:02,623 --> 00:44:05,492
I met him.
He seems okay.

816
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:07,911
He's a lab geek.

817
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:10,947
Fuck, that feels good.

818
00:44:10,965 --> 00:44:13,116
What else?

819
00:44:13,134 --> 00:44:16,887
What else?
I'm exhausted.

820
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:19,639
I spent all afternoon in the sun

821
00:44:19,674 --> 00:44:22,475
throwing dummies off a warehouse,

822
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:26,429
'cause Super Agent Lundy has a hunch that

823
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:30,066
the dead woman is connected
to this big serial killer case.

824
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:31,268
Hmm, really?

825
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:35,739
Oh, yeah.
Lundy always gets his man.

826
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:39,326
Yeah?

827
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,361
Well, so do I.

828
00:44:46,701 --> 00:44:49,152
This is where
I first noticed the pattern.

829
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:51,421
Raleigh, North Carolina, 1993.

830
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:53,673
That got you curious?

831
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:56,509
Then I found
San Francisco, Louisville,

832
00:44:56,544 --> 00:44:58,929
Detroit, Richmond.

833
00:44:58,963 --> 00:45:02,015
Eight different cities in all
that I know of.

834
00:45:02,049 --> 00:45:04,718
Never the same place twice.

835
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:08,504
Until now.

836
00:45:08,522 --> 00:45:10,273
Ready for another?

837
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:13,059
Oh. yeah.

838
00:45:16,364 --> 00:45:19,149
So now this is your little
retirement project?

839
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:23,119
You're completely incapable
of relaxing, aren't you?

840
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:25,989
That's just it.
This is how I relax.

841
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,207
I get the scent of a bad guy,

842
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:29,993
I can feel my blood pressure go down.

843
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:31,461
And here I thought I was bad.

844
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:34,080
You are.

845
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:37,300
You're exactly the same as me,

846
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:41,588
just in a much prettier package.

847
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:44,307
Are you flirting with me,
Agent Lundy?

848
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:49,346
Simply stating the truth, miss.

849
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,148
[phone vibrates]

850
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:02,525
Thank you.

851
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,728
[cell phone rings]

852
00:46:05,746 --> 00:46:07,497
Excuse me just a second.

853
00:46:09,617 --> 00:46:11,034
Hey.

854
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:15,005
Hey, so you want me
to order some takeout?

855
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,341
I'm still working,

856
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:20,343
so I'll just grab something here.

857
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:24,214
Okay, well,
I love you, babe.

858
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:27,050
Me too.

859
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,763
[glass shatters,
car alarm blaring]

860
00:46:40,781 --> 00:46:44,434
Ah, Jesse, hard at work.
Big surprise.

861
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:54,327
I'm gonna wait in your room
and scare the shit out of you.

862
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,972
Jesse!

863
00:47:06,006 --> 00:47:07,307
If you're in here...

864
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:20,803
Andy!

865
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:22,322
Apparently I'm not the only one

866
00:47:22,356 --> 00:47:24,240
who isn't exactly what he seems.

867
00:47:30,531 --> 00:47:33,450
Is that the wrench you use
to break windows?

868
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:36,002
- What the heck?
- Don't move.

869
00:47:36,036 --> 00:47:38,121
Okay, what's going on?
Who are you?

870
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:39,989
You're gonna stop breaking things,

871
00:47:40,007 --> 00:47:41,875
stop rolling cars down the street.

872
00:47:41,926 --> 00:47:44,177
Stop everything you've been doing.

873
00:47:44,211 --> 00:47:46,346
If you so much as touch
another window,

874
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,881
I will come back here,

875
00:47:47,932 --> 00:47:52,135
and I will leave
with your head in a bag.

876
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:54,604
I already have the bag.

877
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:00,360
Fuck you!

878
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:10,120
Let go of me, you fucking asshole!

879
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:12,322
Fuck!

880
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,207
You really don't know
what you're doing here.

881
00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:15,875
I know exactly
what I want to fucking do,

882
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:18,027
Piece of fucking shit.

883
00:48:18,045 --> 00:48:19,879
You should've seen their faces.

884
00:48:19,914 --> 00:48:23,550
Those boxes in their driveways
with their big fucking

885
00:48:23,584 --> 00:48:25,418
flat-screen TV's.

886
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:28,805
"Oh, look at us, aren't we so fucking rich?"

887
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,306
They're lucky the only thing I broke

888
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:32,142
was their fucking windows.

889
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:34,727
And you're lucky
I don't break your fucking neck.

890
00:48:34,762 --> 00:48:36,546
- It's over.
- Fuck you, it's over.

891
00:48:36,564 --> 00:48:39,265
[groaning]

892
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,320
- Give up.
- No!

893
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:47,574
I played by the rules my entire life.

894
00:48:47,608 --> 00:48:50,527
And look what it got me.

895
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:53,563
My wife's dead.
I lost my job.

896
00:48:53,581 --> 00:48:56,899
My son hates me, and now...

897
00:48:56,917 --> 00:48:59,452
The bank wants to take my house away.

898
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:01,921
So if you want to take my fucking head,
you take it.

899
00:49:01,956 --> 00:49:03,873
I said stop.

900
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:05,875
You want me to come back
for your son's head too?

901
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:07,343
What? No!

902
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:08,678
Not my boy!

903
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,298
It's all I have!

904
00:49:14,802 --> 00:49:17,920
You're gonna save
what's left of your family,

905
00:49:17,938 --> 00:49:20,773
save what's left of yourself.

906
00:49:20,808 --> 00:49:23,526
Because all that other stuff

907
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:26,446
is over.

908
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,730
Say it.

909
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,700
Yeah, it's over.

910
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:41,544
Bad news for Andy is
he's lost his house.

911
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,913
Good news for me is he'll
be out of the neighborhood.

912
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:45,832
But why should I care about him?

913
00:49:45,883 --> 00:49:47,133
It's his world.

914
00:49:47,167 --> 00:49:49,118
People like him made it this way.

915
00:49:49,136 --> 00:49:51,671
At least he had a chance to belong.

916
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:03,399
It's still there, Dex.

917
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:06,302
A stain so deep it can't be erased.

918
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:27,707
[grunts]

919
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,709
[sighs]
