3
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:47,309
<i>- Previously on Dexter...

4
00:01:47,343 --> 00:01:50,061
- Bathtub, jumper, bludgeon.

5
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:52,814
Lundy came to Miami
to hunt this guy.

6
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:54,199
I think he got too close,

7
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:56,284
and I think it got him
killed and me shot.

8
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,453
- I can't even imagine
looking into the eyes

9
00:01:58,487 --> 00:01:59,687
of the person you love...

10
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:01,406
Watching as he takes
his last breath.

11
00:02:01,457 --> 00:02:02,523
- How much did you
tell Christine

12
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:03,525
about the Lundy shooting?

13
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:04,876
- I learned my lesson.

14
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,378
I never even took the Lundy
files out of the station.

15
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:07,996
There's no way she
could have seen it.

16
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,381
- How did she know that?

17
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:13,168
How tall was my shooter?

18
00:02:13,202 --> 00:02:14,219
- My height.

19
00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:15,754
- Then it wasn't Trinity.

20
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:17,922
Look, I know it's really tough
for reporters right now,

21
00:02:17,974 --> 00:02:19,174
so maybe I can give you

22
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,542
that interview
you've been wanting from me.

23
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:23,895
- I'm married.

24
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:24,896
- We have this connection.

25
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,048
- I have Dexter.

26
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:28,850
- That smudge you found
at the crime scene--

27
00:02:28,884 --> 00:02:32,354
How do you think he got
the ashes to stick to the wall?

28
00:02:32,388 --> 00:02:34,022
- We got
the killer's goddamn DNA.

29
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:35,023
- Going out of town?

30
00:02:35,057 --> 00:02:36,241
- Yeah.
A four walls build.

31
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:37,442
- An out-of-town build--

32
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:40,228
Is his cycle
starting over again?

33
00:02:41,614 --> 00:02:42,664
- This is where
it all started.

34
00:02:42,698 --> 00:02:43,665
Vera saw me.

35
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:45,367
I startled her,
and she slipped...

36
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:46,868
Shattered
the shower doors.

37
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:48,736
The glass
sliced her leg.

38
00:02:48,754 --> 00:02:51,006
She was dead by the time
the ambulance came.

39
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,541
Don't touch my sister!

40
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:55,260
- Fuck you and fuck Vera.

41
00:02:57,463 --> 00:03:01,466
- Get the fuck off him!

42
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:04,252
I should have fucking killed you
when I had the chance.

43
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:08,440
- Hi, dad.

44
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,935
- A hypodermic needle.

45
00:03:20,953 --> 00:03:24,072
The perfect drug
delivery system.

46
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:27,659
Rapid. Efficient.

47
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,495
Especially
in the right hands.

48
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:34,999
- So how's everyone doing
over there?

49
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,620
- Honey, I know.
Everything's gonna be okay.

50
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:40,955
- Are you okay?

51
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:43,791
- Well, I'm not the one
getting four booster shots.

52
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:44,926
I don't know how you're
not a complete wreck.

53
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,895
- Serial killer. Remember?

54
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:50,565
Well, a little pain now
means a lot less later on.

55
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,799
I should know.

56
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:54,635
I had my chance to eliminate
Arthur early on.

57
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:56,187
I didn't and now--

58
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:59,974
- We ready?

59
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:02,277
- Okay, buddy,
look at daddy.

60
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,319
- I know, I know,
I know.

61
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:13,654
- All right, that's one down.
Three more to go.

62
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:16,875
- The good news is,
you won't remember any of this.

63
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:25,666
I didn't remember what happened
to me as a child...

64
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:32,840
Until I was forced to.

65
00:04:34,193 --> 00:04:36,478
Keeping my tools
in a shipping container

66
00:04:36,512 --> 00:04:38,980
makes more sense
than a backyard shed.

67
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:44,119
After all, it's where
my dark passenger was born.

68
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:48,406
And, after tonight,

69
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:51,576
it's where Arthur Mitchell
will call home.

70
00:04:56,698 --> 00:05:00,752
Arthur is a man of ritual,
like me.

71
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:03,171
Gas up the car,
a quick stop at starbucks,

72
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:04,872
choir practice...

73
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,508
And that's where
I'm going to take him

74
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:08,510
when he's alone in
the parking lot of his church.

75
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,932
Wait.
Why isn't he stopping?

76
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:47,582
- Scott, hold your sister's hand
until we're inside.

77
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,750
- You're not my mother.

78
00:05:51,303 --> 00:05:53,521
- If Arthur thinks
he can lose me in a crowd,

79
00:05:53,556 --> 00:05:55,056
he's dead wrong.

80
00:05:57,276 --> 00:06:01,596
- "Nick, Barb, Scott...

81
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:07,986
Abby."

82
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:44,639
- I know that look.

83
00:06:49,361 --> 00:06:52,196
I'm not the only one
on a stalk.

84
00:06:52,248 --> 00:06:53,448
But it's too soon.

85
00:06:53,482 --> 00:06:57,118
Arthur just finished
his last kill cycle.

86
00:06:57,152 --> 00:07:00,872
By saving his life, have I
set it all in motion again?

87
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:30,702
Where'd you go?

88
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,211
- Scott,
I'm officer Carney.

89
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:42,330
- Am--am I in trouble?

90
00:07:42,364 --> 00:07:43,531
- No, no.

91
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:51,539
Are your mom and dad
Nick and Barb?

92
00:07:51,557 --> 00:07:52,873
- Yes.

93
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:54,342
- I'm afraid they've been
in a car accident.

94
00:07:54,376 --> 00:07:56,043
- Are they okay?

95
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:59,063
- They're gonna be fine,
but they've asked me to take you

96
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:00,715
to go see them
in the hospital.

97
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:01,882
- We have to go get
my sister.

98
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,384
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

99
00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:06,688
My partner's got Abby
in our patrol car.

100
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:09,390
Come on.

101
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:12,744
I'm just glad
I found you.

102
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:34,915
- It wasn't the babysitter
he was after.

103
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:36,134
- This isn't a police car.

104
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:37,585
- I work undercover.

105
00:08:37,603 --> 00:08:39,420
- Wait, where's my sister?

106
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:41,939
- Well, let me radio in
and see where my partner is.

107
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:48,563
- Arthur!

108
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:06,714
- Shit.

109
00:09:10,886 --> 00:09:15,306
- Kyle, I don't appreciate
being followed.

110
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,008
- Arthur,
what are you doing?

111
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:19,126
- I don't know
what you think you saw,

112
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:22,764
but I promise I'll preserve
this boy's innocence.

113
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:24,682
- I'm calling the police.

114
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,517
- If I so much as see
a police car,

115
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:28,102
the boy pays the price.

116
00:09:28,136 --> 00:09:31,022
You like protecting children,
don't you?

117
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:32,973
Like my son.

118
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:35,610
- Arthur, just pull over.
Tell me where you are.

119
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:36,861
- I have a process.

120
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:38,663
As long
as it's not interrupted,

121
00:09:38,697 --> 00:09:40,164
I'll set the boy free.

122
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:41,982
- Arthur, don't do this.
Let the boy go.

123
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,455
- Dexter, he's gonna
kill that child.

124
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:49,257
- He's never taken a child
before.

125
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,541
- That you know of.

126
00:09:50,592 --> 00:09:55,513
If this is new,
this is on you.

127
00:09:55,547 --> 00:09:57,131
- Not if I find him first.

128
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:04,222
- Mr. Butler?

129
00:10:04,273 --> 00:10:05,389
- Where's your mother?

130
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:08,059
- She's picking up Rebecca
from ballet,

131
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,527
but she'll be back
any minute.

132
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:10,528
I really don't think
that you--

133
00:10:10,562 --> 00:10:12,029
- Jonah, don't talk.

134
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:13,397
Just listen and answer.

135
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:14,732
Do you have any idea
where your father is?

136
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:17,201
- He's at some teaching thing
up in Naples.

137
00:10:17,236 --> 00:10:18,736
- How long?

138
00:10:18,787 --> 00:10:19,737
- A couple days.

139
00:10:19,788 --> 00:10:22,206
- A couple of days.
Good.

140
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:24,358
If Arthur's process
takes that long,

141
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:27,545
the boy still has time.

142
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:32,633
- You know, it's like
Thanksgiving never happened.

143
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:36,053
- Except for this.

144
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:38,339
Why are you still here?

145
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:41,259
- I can't leave my mom
and sister alone with him,

146
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,710
and my mom won't leave,
so I'm fucked.

147
00:10:42,728 --> 00:10:45,713
- Look, I need to find
your dad, and fast.

148
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:47,431
I need your help.
- Don't you understand?

149
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:50,885
The longer he's gone,
the better, for all of us.

150
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:53,437
- Jonah, we both know
what he's capable of.

151
00:10:56,909 --> 00:11:00,244
- Did--did he hurt
someone else?

152
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,362
- I hope not.

153
00:11:01,396 --> 00:11:02,530
That's why I need
to find him

154
00:11:02,564 --> 00:11:07,067
to keep him from doing
something really wrong.

155
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:13,374
You have the chance
to finally break the cycle.

156
00:11:13,408 --> 00:11:15,376
- What do you want me to do?

157
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,746
- Go through his desk,
journals, computer.

158
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:20,298
Anything, everything.

159
00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:21,299
Find out
what he's been working on.

160
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,750
- He'd kill me.

161
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:25,887
- I'll make sure
he never finds out.

162
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:28,272
- You know, I...

163
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:30,274
I'm--I'm not--
I'm not sure if I can--

164
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:31,776
If I can do it.

165
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,561
That's my mom
and Rebecca.

166
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:36,948
- There is a great big shit-ugly
world out there, Jonah.

167
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:40,201
The bad stuff doesn't
just end at your doorstep.

168
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:43,404
You can help put an end
to all of it.

169
00:11:43,438 --> 00:11:46,374
- To all of what?
- The sins of your father.

170
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:49,911
Help me, Jonah.

171
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:13,351
- Where am I?

172
00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:20,358
What is this place?

173
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:22,276
- Do you like trains,
Arthur?

174
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,947
- My name isn't Arthur.
It's Scott.

175
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:36,007
- Look at that.

176
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,126
It's a thing of beauty.

177
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:49,020
- I want my mom and dad.

178
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:55,026
Whoo-whoo.

179
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,979
Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo
choo-choo-choo-choo

180
00:12:58,013 --> 00:13:01,699
Choo-choo-choo-choo
choo-choo-choo.

181
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:04,485
Whoo-whoo.

182
00:13:07,122 --> 00:13:12,743
- If Arthur's ritual, like mine,
was born in the past,

183
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:15,329
the past
is where I'll find him.

184
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:22,086
His last cycle of kills
took place in New Orleans.

185
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,311
Matthew Hicks,
ten years old,

186
00:13:30,345 --> 00:13:32,813
went to the local pool,
never came home.

187
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:36,517
Five days before a woman was
found murdered in her bathtub.

188
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:39,687
Before?

189
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:48,696
- You always did have
a soft spot for kids.

190
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,831
They remind you
of what you lost that day

191
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:53,117
in the shipping container.

192
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:56,003
- Innocence.

193
00:13:56,038 --> 00:13:57,838
- Arthur said that's
what he would preserve

194
00:13:57,873 --> 00:14:00,257
in the boy he took.

195
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:02,009
If each of Arthur's victims

196
00:14:02,044 --> 00:14:04,929
represents
members of his family,

197
00:14:04,963 --> 00:14:06,130
then the boy...

198
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:08,215
- Must be Arthur himself.

199
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:12,470
He was ten
when his sister died.

200
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:17,257
Omaha, another ten-year-old
goes missing.

201
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,113
Five days later,
another bathtub murder.

202
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:24,699
St. Paul.

203
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:33,440
Denver.

204
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,744
- Lundy misread the pattern.

205
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:40,614
- It's not three victims
he leaves behind; it's four.

206
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:43,050
Lundy didn't think to look
at missing children

207
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:48,472
because they were never
recorded as homicides.

208
00:14:48,507 --> 00:14:50,091
- Which means five days

209
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:54,311
before the Lisa Bell
bathtub murder here in Miami...

210
00:15:03,271 --> 00:15:07,158
- Another ten-year-old
went missing.

211
00:15:07,192 --> 00:15:11,078
My god.
The boys begin the cycle.

212
00:15:16,118 --> 00:15:17,651
- Hey.

213
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:19,453
- Sorry. Working late.

214
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:21,655
- Like always.

215
00:15:21,673 --> 00:15:23,490
- Is everything okay?

216
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:25,376
- Harrison isn't sleeping,

217
00:15:25,427 --> 00:15:27,344
so I'm gonna keep him
in our bed tonight.

218
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:30,714
- I'll be there in a sec.

219
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:32,883
- Okay.

220
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:47,064
- Arthur could have that boy
anywhere,

221
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:49,116
and now there'll be
an army of police

222
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:50,701
and volunteers
surrounding his parents

223
00:15:50,735 --> 00:15:54,038
to help find their son.

224
00:15:54,072 --> 00:15:56,874
I need to be one of them.

225
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:02,630
If Arthur picked this
particular boy for a reason,

226
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:03,631
I need to know.

227
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,050
Come in.

228
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:07,701
- Hey, Dex,
you wanted to see me?

229
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:09,053
- Gordy,
thanks for coming.

230
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:11,138
- Yeah, sure, no sweat.
What's up?

231
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:14,175
- I dinged a parked van
last night,

232
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:16,644
and I left a note,

233
00:16:16,678 --> 00:16:18,646
but the driver
hasn't called me back.

234
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,214
And I'm thinking,
after I totaled my car,

235
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:21,398
I can't afford

236
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:23,717
to let the insurance companies
get involved.

237
00:16:23,735 --> 00:16:24,718
You think you can do
a stake and notify

238
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:26,570
so I can find this guy,
pay him in cash?

239
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:29,240
- Yeah, sure. Just, uh,
give me the plate,

240
00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:30,390
and if patrol
spots your van,

241
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:32,159
I'll give you a heads-up
on its location.

242
00:16:32,194 --> 00:16:34,195
- Perfect.

243
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:39,083
- Hold on. As soon as he's done
with the uni, I'm next.

244
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:41,752
- Next for what?
- I have to talk to him.

245
00:16:41,786 --> 00:16:44,205
- He's right in there.

246
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:47,925
- I'm still figuring out
how to phrase it.

247
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:49,710
- How gay are you?

248
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:51,512
- Look, I--

249
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:54,882
I saw something at Thanksgiving
I wish I hadn't.

250
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:02,389
- Morgan.
- Gordon.

251
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:08,612
Jesus,
ever hear of a comb?

252
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:09,897
It looks like you have
a cat on your head.

253
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:13,150
- I'm kind of on a mission here.
What's up?

254
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:16,120
- I've got that interview
with Quinn's squeeze today.

255
00:17:16,154 --> 00:17:17,738
- Christine?

256
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:19,790
Are you sure
it's a good idea

257
00:17:19,824 --> 00:17:22,993
to dredge up
all that Lundy stuff?

258
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:25,212
- Actually, I've got
a few questions for her.

259
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,114
I think she might have
some ideas about who shot him.

260
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:29,833
The real question is,
do I give Quinn a heads-up or--

261
00:17:29,885 --> 00:17:31,118
- No, you don't.

262
00:17:31,136 --> 00:17:32,386
I gotta go.

263
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,587
- Just no?
He's my partner.

264
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:34,972
- Yeah, he's also
her boyfriend.

265
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:37,291
You don't know where
his loyalties are.

266
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:38,509
Deb, I've got field work
I've got to do.

267
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,127
- Yeah, and I've got
a briefing on Trinity

268
00:17:40,145 --> 00:17:41,128
in, like, two minutes.

269
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:42,346
My case.

270
00:17:42,397 --> 00:17:43,931
I need your big brain, bro.

271
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:45,099
- There's no new blood.
There's no need.

272
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:46,650
- No way.

273
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:50,688
You do realize I will stand here
all fucking morning.

274
00:17:50,739 --> 00:17:52,306
If Trinity works
in the public school system

275
00:17:52,324 --> 00:17:54,191
and we can't get the okay
to swab these guys,

276
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:55,609
we are beyond boned.

277
00:17:55,643 --> 00:17:57,978
- If he's even in
the school system.

278
00:17:57,996 --> 00:18:00,698
Sorry, Deb, but the sooner
this is over,

279
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:02,482
the sooner I get to
that missing boy's parents.

280
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,535
- We've had better luck
with private schools,

281
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:06,870
and so far
we're looking at 240 males

282
00:18:06,922 --> 00:18:08,839
who fit our Trinity profile.

283
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:10,541
- Well, collect their samples
and get them to Masuka.

284
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:13,493
- Oh, wonderful.
More old man spit.

285
00:18:13,511 --> 00:18:15,462
- Dexter, I need the blood
evidence in that bar stabbing.

286
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:16,663
- Proofing it.

287
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:18,933
- Proof faster.
Prelim's tomorrow.

288
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:20,050
Where are we
on the Lundy shooting?

289
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:21,802
- I'm still on
the foreign nationals

290
00:18:21,836 --> 00:18:23,637
that were staying
at the hotel.

291
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:26,840
So, no significant
developments.

292
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:30,477
- When you say it
like that, no.

293
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:32,146
- Okay.

294
00:18:37,902 --> 00:18:39,853
- Hey, uh, Dex,
you got a minute?

295
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:41,071
It's about Thanksgiving.

296
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:43,574
- Later, Vince.

297
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,876
- Uh...

298
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,494
Okay.

299
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:51,131
- Uh, lieutenant, could you
authorize this requisition?

300
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,533
Could it be so wrong
if you and I

301
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:55,386
hopped on the first plane
to an island somewhere?

302
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,222
- Yes, and this isn't
a requisition.

303
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:00,007
It's a thai menu.
- Mm-hmm.

304
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,708
- Thank you for bringing that
to my attention, sergeant.

305
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:04,211
- Start at community colleges,
work our way up?

306
00:19:04,229 --> 00:19:05,545
- Detectives.

307
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:06,880
- Babe?

308
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:09,566
- Keep it in your pants.
She's here to see me.

309
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:10,717
- Oh, you're finally
doing the interview?

310
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:13,404
- She is persistent.

311
00:19:13,438 --> 00:19:14,405
- Tell me about it.

312
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:15,722
- And when I'm done,

313
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,941
everyone in Miami is gonna know
what a true hero is.

314
00:19:17,993 --> 00:19:21,395
- Don't forget your partner.
That's Quinn with two N's.

315
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:23,163
- Oh, shit, I forgot to
run something by Batista.

316
00:19:23,198 --> 00:19:24,198
Will you show her
to the box?

317
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:25,199
And I'll be there
in two seconds?

318
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,234
- Yeah.

319
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:35,009
- I need you to watch
Christine interview me.

320
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:37,127
- And I would do that why?

321
00:19:37,178 --> 00:19:39,963
- This could have something
to do with the Lundy shooting.

322
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:41,632
No significant developments,
remember?

323
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:42,800
- Okay.

324
00:19:50,642 --> 00:19:51,859
- I'm hungry.

325
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:55,195
- Well, why don't you
put your pajamas on

326
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,931
and we'll have
something to eat.

327
00:20:00,485 --> 00:20:02,870
- No, I won't do it.

328
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:04,955
I won't do anything
you tell me to.

329
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:20,754
- Don't you understand?

330
00:20:20,788 --> 00:20:25,509
Father drinks,
and mother pays the price.

331
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:31,815
I'm just trying
to protect you, Arthur.

332
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,633
- My name is Scott!

333
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:39,523
- Very well.

334
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:55,122
- Mr. Smith.
- Yes.

335
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:57,324
- I'm Dexter Morgan,
Miami metro.

336
00:20:57,342 --> 00:21:00,127
I'm not here
in any official capacity.

337
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:01,495
I just want to do
anything I can

338
00:21:01,513 --> 00:21:04,181
to help find
your missing son.

339
00:21:04,215 --> 00:21:06,683
- We haven't set up
phone banks yet,

340
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:10,354
but, uh, we have
some flyers.

341
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:12,856
- May I take some with me?

342
00:21:12,891 --> 00:21:14,858
- Great.

343
00:21:21,032 --> 00:21:23,367
- I'm the only one here
who knows what happened.

344
00:21:23,401 --> 00:21:27,738
I could point the police in
Arthur Mitchell's direction.

345
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:30,190
But the slightest misstep
on their part

346
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:35,045
ensures this family
is never whole again.

347
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:40,083
- Is there any information
at all on your son?

348
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:42,085
A tip, a lead,
a phone call?

349
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:43,754
Anything that could point me
in a direction?

350
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:44,755
- None.

351
00:21:44,806 --> 00:21:48,542
I keep waiting
for a ransom note.

352
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,344
Something.

353
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:53,046
- I'd better go
post these.

354
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:55,715
I'm gonna do everything I can
to help you get your son back.

355
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:58,885
- Thank you.

356
00:22:01,606 --> 00:22:05,058
- Can you imagine walking by
your kid's empty bedroom,

357
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:06,443
not knowing where he is?

358
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:10,230
- No. I can't.

359
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:14,168
- How does a guy like this
make a dead body

360
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:15,619
just disappear
into thin air?

361
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:18,205
- The gulf stream
does the trick for me.

362
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:19,406
- But there's no ocean
in Omaha,

363
00:22:19,424 --> 00:22:21,875
Des Moines, St. Paul,
or Denver.

364
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:24,711
- The four walls houses.

365
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:27,247
He goes to each one
of those cities on a build

366
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:29,216
as a pretext
for his killing cycle.

367
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,601
- Construction site

368
00:22:30,635 --> 00:22:32,919
would be a convenient place
to bury a body.

369
00:22:32,937 --> 00:22:36,423
- Or to hold a boy captive.

370
00:22:38,693 --> 00:22:40,861
- Three years on patrol,

371
00:22:40,895 --> 00:22:43,981
two years in vice.

372
00:22:44,032 --> 00:22:47,284
Why homicide?

373
00:22:47,318 --> 00:22:49,069
- My dad
was a detective here.

374
00:22:49,103 --> 00:22:50,320
- Hmm.

375
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:53,123
- But it was completely
different being a cop back then.

376
00:22:53,157 --> 00:22:57,294
- Yeah, I bet.
Talk about your man's world.

377
00:22:57,328 --> 00:23:00,797
- Oh, no, no,
it wasn't just that.

378
00:23:00,832 --> 00:23:04,468
I think you had to rely more
on your instincts back then.

379
00:23:04,502 --> 00:23:07,221
There wasn't
all this forensics stuff

380
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:09,172
to lean on
to break a case.

381
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:11,174
Back then, you had to rely
on your gut.

382
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:13,510
- Amen to that.

383
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:20,434
- Have you seen these?

384
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,493
- Forensically, we're at
a dead end with the Lundy case,

385
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:35,449
so I just stare at these,
looking for answers.

386
00:23:41,656 --> 00:23:43,340
- You know what?

387
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:48,995
I've got enough
background info.

388
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:52,466
How about I just write this up
and give you a call

389
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,553
if, uh, we didn't cover
everything?

390
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:58,605
- Sure.

391
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:03,694
Can I ask you something?

392
00:24:03,728 --> 00:24:05,195
You live over in The Gables,
right?

393
00:24:05,229 --> 00:24:06,196
- Yeah.

394
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,565
- Ah, that must be
really nice,

395
00:24:08,616 --> 00:24:09,983
being away from all that
touristy stuff.

396
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:12,903
- Well, I got lucky.
Found a great building.

397
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:15,188
- Yeah, so The Gables,
that's what, like, uh,

398
00:24:15,206 --> 00:24:18,709
60 minutes from the hotel
where Frank was staying?

399
00:24:18,743 --> 00:24:20,744
- I guess.
- Wow.

400
00:24:20,795 --> 00:24:23,863
You sure got to
the crime scene fast.

401
00:24:26,701 --> 00:24:28,719
There's no traffic
at 5:00 a.m.

402
00:24:28,753 --> 00:24:30,087
- Oh, I know that.

403
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:33,707
But dispatch didn't
put out the call till 5:05.

404
00:24:33,725 --> 00:24:37,094
You were the first reporter
on scene at 5:20.

405
00:24:40,732 --> 00:24:43,883
- I like to roll out of bed
and hit the gym early.

406
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:46,520
I was on my way there
when I heard the scanner.

407
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:49,356
- Bullshit.
She's lying.

408
00:24:53,728 --> 00:24:55,395
- Um, how do I
get out of here?

409
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:01,735
- You just
follow the windows

410
00:25:01,753 --> 00:25:03,403
till you get
to the elevator.

411
00:25:18,753 --> 00:25:21,855
- We've got to tread
very, very lightly with it.

412
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:23,390
If Quinn--
- No shit.

413
00:25:23,424 --> 00:25:25,108
That's why I'm asking you
to help me sort through this.

414
00:25:25,143 --> 00:25:27,310
Tell me I'm not crazy.
- You're not crazy.

415
00:25:27,362 --> 00:25:30,313
I spoke to Christine
at your crime scene.

416
00:25:30,365 --> 00:25:32,032
Hair made, full makeup.

417
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:34,151
No way she rolled out of bed
at 5:00 a.m. looking like that.

418
00:25:34,202 --> 00:25:36,436
- I'm telling you she knows more
than she's letting on.

419
00:25:36,454 --> 00:25:38,288
She's a hard-boiled
crime scene reporter,

420
00:25:38,322 --> 00:25:40,290
and she couldn't even fucking
look at those photos of Lundy.

421
00:25:40,324 --> 00:25:43,577
- Suspicious,
but it doesn't prove a thing.

422
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:44,661
- Well,
there's something else.

423
00:25:44,712 --> 00:25:48,131
I know it sounds weird,
but the other day,

424
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,833
she was talking to me
about how I was

425
00:25:49,884 --> 00:25:53,170
looking in Lundy's eyes
when he died.

426
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:55,172
How the fuck does she know
he didn't die instantly?

427
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:56,623
- LaGuerta got broward
county school district

428
00:25:56,641 --> 00:25:58,425
to let us collect samples.

429
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:01,645
Still working on dade.
- Great.

430
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,979
- Everything okay?

431
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:05,482
- Yeah. Great.

432
00:26:05,516 --> 00:26:07,133
Be right there.

433
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:10,153
- Great.

434
00:26:10,188 --> 00:26:12,656
- We can't be doing this
with Quinn around.

435
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,824
- Thank you.

436
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:26,319
- Build's nearly finished.

437
00:26:26,337 --> 00:26:28,488
No one's here.

438
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:40,333
They're not here.

439
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:43,837
Fuck!

440
00:26:46,507 --> 00:26:47,641
Hello?

441
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:49,309
- Kyle, I went through
my dad's desk.

442
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:51,027
You know,
there's nothing here.

443
00:26:51,062 --> 00:26:52,562
- What about his computer?

444
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,347
- I already looked.

445
00:26:54,365 --> 00:26:55,649
There's--it's just
school stuff.

446
00:26:55,683 --> 00:26:58,902
- Look at the search history.
Does anything stand out?

447
00:26:58,953 --> 00:27:02,155
- Okay, okay, okay.
One sec, one sec.

448
00:27:02,189 --> 00:27:04,190
Nothing, really.

449
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,209
We got some bible stuff.

450
00:27:06,244 --> 00:27:09,663
A hardware store.
A real estate agency.

451
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:11,131
The local paper.
- The real estate site.

452
00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:12,332
What was he looking at?

453
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:15,418
- Uh, let's see.

454
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,871
It's just a bunch of homes
for sale.

455
00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:19,205
- An empty house.

456
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:21,541
Good place to ensure
his process isn't disturbed.

457
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:24,144
- I can email you the list
if you want.

458
00:27:25,847 --> 00:27:27,063
I don't have email.

459
00:27:27,098 --> 00:27:29,399
- Who doesn't have email,
Kyle?

460
00:27:29,433 --> 00:27:31,852
- Off the top of my head,
people who don't exist.

461
00:27:31,886 --> 00:27:34,053
Fax them to the Kinko's
near your house under my name.

462
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:35,054
I'll pick them up there.

463
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:36,406
- Okay.

464
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,608
- Jonah, you're doing
the right thing.

465
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,827
- You know, how--

466
00:27:40,862 --> 00:27:42,779
How come
you're the only one

467
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,081
who can see my dad
for what he is?

468
00:27:45,116 --> 00:27:48,251
- We have a few things
in common.

469
00:27:50,755 --> 00:27:52,589
- Police are searching
for a north Miami boy

470
00:27:52,623 --> 00:27:53,874
who went missing
last night.

471
00:27:53,908 --> 00:27:56,426
Ten-year-old Scott Smith
was in an arcade with his sister

472
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,712
and their nanny
at around 7:45 p.m.

473
00:27:58,746 --> 00:28:00,430
When the nanny,
Susan Peterson,

474
00:28:00,464 --> 00:28:02,766
realized that Scott
was no longer at her side.

475
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,084
Fight, fight, fight!

476
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:07,270
Fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight!

477
00:28:07,305 --> 00:28:09,389
- Cody?

478
00:28:09,423 --> 00:28:11,274
- Let go.
Let go of him, Cody.

479
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:13,727
- Cody! Cody, come here.
Cody, what are you doing?

480
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:16,095
- He said he saw Dexter leave
the young sailors camp-out

481
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:17,597
in the middle of the night
'cause he was scared,

482
00:28:17,615 --> 00:28:18,598
so I hit him.

483
00:28:18,616 --> 00:28:20,951
- I'm so sorry.
Boys, huh?

484
00:28:20,985 --> 00:28:23,203
- If my son said
that's what he saw,

485
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:24,237
I believe him.

486
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:26,272
Come on.

487
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,924
- Why, hello.

488
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:47,010
I'm so glad
I finally got you.

489
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:49,295
- Actually, I'm in the middle
of a project.

490
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:51,314
- Dad, I really
need to see you.

491
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:55,685
- You just did.
Thanksgiving night.

492
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:59,072
- I can't wait another
four months until my birthday.

493
00:28:59,106 --> 00:29:02,525
Can we meet in between
our usual visits?

494
00:29:02,577 --> 00:29:03,977
Just this once?

495
00:29:03,995 --> 00:29:05,946
- There's a reason
why we only see each other

496
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,313
a couple of times a year,
Christine.

497
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:11,785
I have a full life
and a family who needs me.

498
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:15,455
- I'm your family too.

499
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:18,541
I need you.
More than they do.

500
00:29:18,593 --> 00:29:21,094
- Sorry, sweetie,
it'll have to wait.

501
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:23,663
Love you.

502
00:29:23,681 --> 00:29:27,500
- I think I'm in trouble.

503
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:31,671
Dad?

504
00:30:01,052 --> 00:30:04,754
- So are you
gonna let me go?

505
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:08,174
- In due time, Arthur.

506
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:10,560
- Why do you keep
calling me that?

507
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,612
- Is that food for me?

508
00:30:29,664 --> 00:30:32,949
- You can have
something to eat

509
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,953
once you put
your pajamas on, Arthur.

510
00:30:46,747 --> 00:30:49,248
Oh, this is delicious.

511
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:26,886
- So far I've looked at six
empty houses on Jonah's list.

512
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:33,459
This one, not so empty.

513
00:31:42,603 --> 00:31:43,937
- Hey.

514
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:45,989
- Dexter, are you
on your way home?

515
00:31:46,023 --> 00:31:48,975
- Just finishing up
a few things.

516
00:31:48,993 --> 00:31:50,777
- Oh. The baby
has a fever.

517
00:31:50,811 --> 00:31:52,779
How long do you think
you're gonna be?

518
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:54,247
- Not very.

519
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:56,833
There's still another house
I can check on the way home.

520
00:32:24,979 --> 00:32:27,363
- Scott?

521
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:28,648
Scott Smith?

522
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:40,160
- Me and my kids
got nowhere else to be.

523
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:42,912
My babies just need a place
to feel safe at night.

524
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:45,465
We don't make a mess
or nothin'.

525
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:49,202
You ain't gonna tell?

526
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,704
- No.

527
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:54,724
No, I won't.

528
00:33:02,216 --> 00:33:04,184
- Shh.

529
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:05,935
Thank god.

530
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:08,404
Hey, can you take him?

531
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:11,691
- Yeah.

532
00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:13,893
Oh, he's so warm.

533
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:16,279
- Yeah. Those shots really
did a number on him.

534
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,697
Look, can you take
his temperature again?

535
00:33:17,731 --> 00:33:19,032
The thermometer's
on the counter.

536
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:21,084
You're late.
Big day?

537
00:33:21,118 --> 00:33:23,119
- Yeah, I was helping out
with that missing boy.

538
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:26,739
- Oh, that's so sweet.
Those poor parents.

539
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:30,293
Speaking of which,
Paul's folks called.

540
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:33,546
They want to take the kids
to Disney World one weekend.

541
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,581
- You sure
that's a good idea?

542
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,766
I've never even met them.

543
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,268
- They're nothing like Paul.

544
00:33:38,302 --> 00:33:41,437
He was the abusive black sheep
of the family.

545
00:33:41,472 --> 00:33:45,859
Plus, I think it would be good
for Cody right now.

546
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:51,731
- What happened to his eye?

547
00:33:51,765 --> 00:33:53,933
- One of the young sailors
said you disappeared

548
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:55,902
the night
of the camping trip.

549
00:33:55,936 --> 00:33:59,038
Cody was defending
your honor.

550
00:33:59,073 --> 00:34:00,773
- Huh.

551
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:03,409
The only time I left
my tent that night

552
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:06,079
was to find a tree.

553
00:34:06,113 --> 00:34:08,331
- Well, Cody doesn't want to be
part of the group anymore.

554
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:11,384
He said he doesn't want to be
around somebody who tells lies.

555
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:12,785
- Too late.

556
00:34:14,672 --> 00:34:16,389
100.1.

557
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:17,640
- Oy.

558
00:34:17,675 --> 00:34:19,458
You mind giving him
a sponge bath, cool him off?

559
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:20,760
Food will be ready
when you're done.

560
00:34:20,794 --> 00:34:22,428
- Okay.
- Okay.

561
00:34:22,462 --> 00:34:24,264
- This is so frustrating.

562
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:26,816
None of it makes
any fucking sense.

563
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:30,353
- What if Christine
was covering for a source

564
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:32,772
that knew something
about this?

565
00:34:32,806 --> 00:34:34,857
- Possibly.

566
00:34:40,314 --> 00:34:42,665
I couldn't even look Quinn
in the eye.

567
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,700
- Don't worry.

568
00:34:43,751 --> 00:34:46,002
We're gonna
figure this out.

569
00:34:46,036 --> 00:34:49,005
We just gotta think
outside the box.

570
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,375
- How's this
for outside the box?

571
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:54,961
Christine's the same height
as the shooter.

572
00:35:01,435 --> 00:35:04,520
- Christine shoots Lundy.
Why?

573
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:11,060
- Beats the mother-fuck
out of me.

574
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:13,346
She doesn't have a record.

575
00:35:13,364 --> 00:35:14,731
- You ran her prints?

576
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:16,199
- After the interview,

577
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:20,536
I lifted them off some pictures
I got her to pick up.

578
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:23,522
- Maybe she has priors that
she hasn't been nailed on.

579
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,527
- We get her DNA, we check it
against the database.

580
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:30,696
- You and I both know

581
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:32,531
we don't have enough
to get a warrant.

582
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:35,001
- Think outside the box,
sergeant.

583
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:42,558
- Nothing like clean,
cool water,

584
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:45,211
huh, big guy?

585
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:47,546
You'll be as good as new
in no time.

586
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:49,349
But will I?

587
00:35:49,383 --> 00:35:50,900
I killed an innocent man

588
00:35:50,934 --> 00:35:52,852
when I left the campsite
that night.

589
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:56,522
Now Rita and Cody have been
drawn into defending a lie.

590
00:35:56,556 --> 00:36:00,526
My lie.

591
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,861
Trinity's not the only one

592
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:05,581
using his family
as human shields.

593
00:36:05,616 --> 00:36:07,233
- Are you out
of your fucking mind?

594
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:08,918
No way Christine
had anything

595
00:36:08,952 --> 00:36:10,503
to do with shooting you
or Lundy!

596
00:36:10,537 --> 00:36:12,071
- You've been dating her
for what, two months?

597
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:13,673
How well do you even
fucking know her?

598
00:36:13,707 --> 00:36:15,408
- What is this, some Morgan
vendetta against me?

599
00:36:15,426 --> 00:36:16,876
Is your asshole brother
behind this?

600
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,679
- Why the fuck would my brother
have anything to do with this?

601
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:22,181
- Forget it. It--

602
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:26,019
Look, you're probably right
about Christine,

603
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:28,304
and I am totally off-base,

604
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:29,355
but you're a cop,
and a good one,

605
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,923
and I know
you know what it's like

606
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:33,359
when you have a hunch.

607
00:36:33,394 --> 00:36:36,729
- Who else knows
about this?

608
00:36:36,763 --> 00:36:38,281
- Batista.

609
00:36:38,315 --> 00:36:41,067
- Great. You're making me
look like a fucking asshole.

610
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:44,654
- Don't make this
about you.

611
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:48,157
Does she
keep a toothbrush here?

612
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:51,411
Christine will never know
about this.

613
00:36:51,445 --> 00:36:52,995
And when the results
come back clean,

614
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:55,631
you can shove this up my ass
anytime you want.

615
00:36:58,135 --> 00:37:02,422
I need you to get
a DNA panel on this asap.

616
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:04,974
- That's your emergency?

617
00:37:05,008 --> 00:37:08,344
<i>Project runway is on.

618
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:10,129
Fuck you.

619
00:37:10,147 --> 00:37:13,516
- I'll owe you one, all right?
- Who's it belong to?

620
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:16,102
- We may have a big fucking
lead on the Lundy case,

621
00:37:16,136 --> 00:37:20,106
and...
Just fucking run it.

622
00:37:31,985 --> 00:37:34,587
- Six houses down,
another eight to go,

623
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:36,456
and I'm running out of time.

624
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:41,878
Morgan.

625
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,963
- Dexter,
where the hell are you?

626
00:37:43,997 --> 00:37:46,665
- En route.
Traffic.

627
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:50,720
- Okay, well, the DA's all
over me about that blood report.

628
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:52,388
- I'll have it on your desk
in half an hour.

629
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:04,183
- What?

630
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:06,285
- I was just thinking.

631
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,853
Christmas is coming up.

632
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:10,706
You got any plans?

633
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:12,691
- You and me.

634
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,827
- What about your family?

635
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:18,531
- Hmm.
We're not that close.

636
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:21,834
- I guess that's why
you never talk about them.

637
00:38:21,868 --> 00:38:24,086
- Have you seen
my toothbrush?

638
00:38:24,138 --> 00:38:27,706
- Oh, the cleaning lady must
have thrown it out by mistake.

639
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:29,542
- She's jealous
of my perfect teeth.

640
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,513
- Here. Brand new.

641
00:38:36,016 --> 00:38:37,400
- Are you okay?

642
00:38:37,434 --> 00:38:38,901
- Yeah.

643
00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:41,737
- Yeah?

644
00:38:41,772 --> 00:38:44,774
Are you sure?

645
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:46,325
- Now's not a good time.

646
00:38:51,231 --> 00:38:53,566
- Well, maybe it is
a good time for me.

647
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:55,234
You ever consider that?

648
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:59,121
- Wow. Um...

649
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:02,091
- This is about your partner,
isn't it?

650
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:03,576
Did she say
something to you?

651
00:39:03,594 --> 00:39:06,745
- About what?

652
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:09,382
- She gave
a shitty interview.

653
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:10,633
I'm ditching the article.

654
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:11,934
- So you think she's pissed
about that?

655
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:14,637
- I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

656
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,439
I'm gonna be late
for work.

657
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:25,982
Daddy, I can't wait.
I need to see you now.

658
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:29,986
We might be in trouble.

659
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:33,406
We have to talk about,
uh...

660
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:39,879
That woman in the bathtub
that night

661
00:39:39,913 --> 00:39:41,998
when I was little.

662
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:45,051
Please call me back.
Please.

663
00:39:52,843 --> 00:39:55,344
- Now what'll we call
this station?

664
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:56,929
- Why can't I go home?

665
00:39:56,963 --> 00:40:00,933
- Northern Springs?
Rainbow Valley?

666
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:04,904
How about, uh,
Copper Flats?

667
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:11,527
- This is stupid!

668
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,448
You should take me home.

669
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:17,166
I want to see
my mom and dad.

670
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:26,342
<i>- ¶ Hey, Venus! ¶

671
00:40:26,376 --> 00:40:30,663
<i>¶ Oh, Venus! ¶

672

¶ A lovely girl
with sunlight in her hair. ¶

674
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:41,307
¶ And take the brightest stars

675
00:40:41,341 --> 00:40:44,677

in her eyes for me. ¶

<i>- ¶ Can't be too great
a task. ¶

680
00:41:02,362 --> 00:41:04,380

Vera's favorite song.

00:41:04,414 --> 00:41:06,865
<i>- ¶ Venus, if you do ¶

682
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:08,751

684

687

It wasn't my fault.

689
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:22,682
It wasn't my fault.

Uh, I'm sorry
about your sister.

694
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:42,585
And if it'll make you feel
any better,

695
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:44,737
you can call me Arthur.

00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:53,963
- Sure.

699
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:56,599
Now how about we play trains
a little bit more

700
00:41:56,633 --> 00:41:59,268
and then you can
take me home.

701
00:41:59,302 --> 00:42:04,089
<i>- ¶ Oh, Venus! ¶

702
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:06,925
<i>¶ Make my wish come true. ¶

703
00:42:09,262 --> 00:42:12,698
- You're a dear boy,
Arthur.

704
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:14,950
So innocent.

705
00:42:14,985 --> 00:42:18,771
Kind-hearted.

706
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:22,941
Promise me
you'll always stay that way.

707
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:24,493
- Sure.

708
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:31,950
- Hey, do you like
ice cream?

709
00:42:52,272 --> 00:42:55,574
After you've, uh,

710
00:42:55,609 --> 00:42:58,444
finished your treat...

711
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:03,666
I think it's time
to let you go free.

712
00:43:20,634 --> 00:43:23,335
- Yeah, I'm calling about
the house on Olive.

713
00:43:23,353 --> 00:43:26,272
Yeah, I'm sure
the curbside appeal is great,

714
00:43:26,306 --> 00:43:30,109
but I need to know,
is the house occupied?

715
00:43:30,143 --> 00:43:34,196
Oh, the current owners
are still living there.

716
00:43:34,231 --> 00:43:37,199
Great.
Yes, okay.

717
00:43:37,234 --> 00:43:38,901
No need for a drive-by.

718
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:41,120
You stay blessed too.

719
00:43:41,154 --> 00:43:43,739
Lieutenant, blood report
on the bar stabbing.

720
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,876
- Hey, Dexter, just got word
on that stake and notify.

721
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,712
We found your van
about 20 minutes ago.

722
00:43:49,746 --> 00:43:50,830
It was at a diner
on Flagler and Fourth.

723
00:43:50,864 --> 00:43:52,915
Hope you find your guy.

724
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:56,001
- Me too.

725
00:43:56,035 --> 00:43:59,088
If Arthur's van was spotted
close to where he has the boy,

726
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:01,557
that should narrow
my search down considerably.

727
00:44:01,591 --> 00:44:03,709
Fourth and Flagler.

728
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:07,229
Four listings
in the area.

729
00:44:07,264 --> 00:44:11,433
Two within a mile.

730
00:44:12,486 --> 00:44:15,220
- Uh, hey, Dex...

731
00:44:15,238 --> 00:44:16,522
- Where are you off to?

732
00:44:16,556 --> 00:44:18,056
- Kill the guy
you're looking for.

733
00:44:18,074 --> 00:44:20,276
Save a kid. Remember
to pick up diapers.

734
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:22,561
I have to be
two places at once.

735
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:23,662
Not a great day.

736
00:44:23,697 --> 00:44:26,415
- I hear you.

737
00:44:26,449 --> 00:44:28,918
I'm half out of my mind trying
to crack this Lundy thing.

738
00:44:28,952 --> 00:44:31,236
- Debra Morgan!

739
00:44:31,254 --> 00:44:33,289
- Fuck me twice on Sunday.
That's all I need.

740
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,907
- Who's that?

741
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:36,258
- One of dad's
old fuck buddies.

742
00:44:36,293 --> 00:44:37,426
Emphasis on old.

743
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,712
- Harry's past
is a minefield.

744
00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:41,881
But I've got my own
ticking bomb to defuse.

745
00:44:41,915 --> 00:44:44,967
Let me know what happens.

746
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:46,802
- What's up, Valerie?

747
00:44:46,853 --> 00:44:49,305
- I'm sorry I said those things
about your father.

748
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,524
He dumped me for another CI,

749
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:53,142
and all this time,
it still hurts.

750
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:56,261
- Do you happen to remember
this other woman's name?

751
00:44:56,279 --> 00:44:59,732
- No, but I bet
she'd remember me.

752
00:44:59,766 --> 00:45:00,900
God, I was completely
out of my mind.

753
00:45:00,934 --> 00:45:03,268
Went to her house,
confronted her.

754
00:45:03,286 --> 00:45:06,372
- Valerie, I have to go.
I will call you.

755
00:45:10,443 --> 00:45:12,878
- So, um,
pick you up later?

756
00:45:12,913 --> 00:45:14,780
Get a bottle of wine?

757
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:16,131
- You're...

758
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:17,466
- In love with
a beautiful woman.

759
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,952
So shoot me.

760
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:23,255
- Lieutenant.

761
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:25,290
The DNA results
on Christine Hill are back.

762
00:45:25,308 --> 00:45:28,844
- She's fucking related
to Trinity.

763
00:46:11,304 --> 00:46:12,855
- Bomb shelter.

764
00:46:37,914 --> 00:46:40,198
- 1960s Miami.

765
00:46:40,216 --> 00:46:41,750
Cuban missile crisis.

766
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:44,003
Irony is,
places like this were built

767
00:46:44,037 --> 00:46:45,337
to keep people safe.

768
00:46:45,371 --> 00:46:47,056
- I hate irony.

769
00:46:52,378 --> 00:46:55,147
They were here...

770
00:46:55,181 --> 00:46:57,399
And I just missed them.

771
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:10,195
- I'm sorry, daddy.

772
00:47:10,229 --> 00:47:11,664
Thanks for meeting me.

773
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:14,249
I never told you because
I thought it was a dream.

774
00:47:14,284 --> 00:47:15,868
And I wanted it to be,
but it wasn't.

775
00:47:15,902 --> 00:47:17,786
- Now, now, now, now, now,
slow down.

776
00:47:17,837 --> 00:47:20,089
What are you talking about?

777
00:47:20,123 --> 00:47:22,875
- I saw you that night.

778
00:47:22,909 --> 00:47:24,743
Back when I was five.

779
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:26,128
- You told me to stay
in the car, but I didn't.

780
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:29,715
So I got out and I went
into that woman's house.

781
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:35,637
And I saw you
in the bathtub with her.

782
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:37,723
The water was so red.

783
00:47:37,757 --> 00:47:40,809
- It was a dream.

784
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,929
You were right
the first time.

785
00:47:43,947 --> 00:47:46,699
- It wasn't.

786
00:47:46,733 --> 00:47:47,816
I knew it wasn't

787
00:47:47,867 --> 00:47:49,618
when it happened again
in the same house

788
00:47:49,652 --> 00:47:51,153
30 years later.

789
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:05,718
- I couldn't
figure this out in time.

790
00:48:07,637 --> 00:48:09,638
- You'll have another shot
at Arthur.

791
00:48:09,672 --> 00:48:10,789
Isn't that what you want?

792
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:14,593
- What if it was Harrison
or Cody?

793
00:48:14,627 --> 00:48:16,461
- Your priorities
have changed.

794
00:48:19,933 --> 00:48:22,634
I'm a father now.

795
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,437
- I went back
and I looked through

796
00:48:25,471 --> 00:48:27,740
all the postcards
you sent me over the years.

797
00:48:27,774 --> 00:48:32,327
Every trip you took
in every city you went,

798
00:48:32,362 --> 00:48:33,662
a woman died in a bathtub.

799
00:48:33,696 --> 00:48:34,696
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

800
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:38,117
- It's all right.
I protected you.

801
00:48:38,151 --> 00:48:40,819
That FBI agent? Lundy.

802
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:45,290
He was starting to get close,
but I stopped him.

803
00:48:45,324 --> 00:48:46,759
I got in with
the homicide department

804
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:50,095
so I'd know what they knew.

805
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:52,464
And I followed Lundy

806
00:48:52,498 --> 00:48:54,166
and I saw you
run into him.

807
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:55,667
And he started
putting things together,

808
00:48:55,685 --> 00:48:58,837
and he was never gonna stop,
so I shot him.

809
00:48:58,855 --> 00:49:00,189
- You what?

810
00:49:00,223 --> 00:49:01,506
- It's okay.

811
00:49:01,524 --> 00:49:04,643
I made it look like
another crime spree.

812
00:49:04,677 --> 00:49:07,613
The Vacation Murders.
The police had no idea.

813
00:49:07,647 --> 00:49:10,899
- Had?

814
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:13,185
- Well, they still don't have
anything solid.

815
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:16,455
But they're starting
to ask questions.

816
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:18,290
- No.

817
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,367
- Dad.

818
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:34,139
- You put yourself
at risk...

819
00:49:34,174 --> 00:49:35,874
For me.

820
00:49:35,892 --> 00:49:40,846
- I'd do anything
for you.

821
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,097
More than your other kids.

822
00:49:42,148 --> 00:49:43,982
They would never do
what I did for you.

823
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:45,517
- It's gonna be okay,
baby.

824
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:48,821
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, I promise you.

825
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:50,355
- Okay.

826
00:49:50,389 --> 00:49:53,492
- You've always been
so special to me.

827
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:03,568
Dad.

828
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:04,620
Dad.

829
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:08,740
- Now go home.

830
00:50:08,758 --> 00:50:10,175
- No.

831
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,710
- I'll drop by tonight,

832
00:50:11,744 --> 00:50:15,747
and we'll figure
all of this out, okay?

833
00:50:15,765 --> 00:50:18,250
Go on now.

834
00:50:18,268 --> 00:50:20,769
- It's gonna be fine.

835
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:44,376
Stupid fucking cunt!

836
00:51:14,824 --> 00:51:16,074
- No wonder none
of those missing boys

837
00:51:16,109 --> 00:51:17,159
has ever been found.

838
00:51:17,193 --> 00:51:18,744
- Encase a body in cement

839
00:51:18,778 --> 00:51:22,414
and it's preserved forever.

840
00:51:22,448 --> 00:51:24,449
The four walls build.

841
00:51:24,483 --> 00:51:25,867
- You were already there.

842
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:28,921
- Arthur wasn't ready then.

843
00:51:28,955 --> 00:51:31,089
He is now.

844
00:51:42,168 --> 00:51:45,887
Burying a child in cement.
That's not very christian.

845
00:51:49,726 --> 00:51:51,059
- No closer.

846
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:53,845
- I'll take that to mean
the boy is still alive.

847
00:51:53,863 --> 00:51:57,182
- Walk away, Kyle.
This doesn't concern you.

848
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,901
- There's no way
I can do that.

849
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:01,820
- I need to do this.

850
00:52:19,038 --> 00:52:20,806
I can't stop this.

851
00:52:22,675 --> 00:52:24,009
- I can.

852
00:52:55,408 --> 00:52:57,376
Alive.

853
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:14,393
Arthur!

854
00:53:23,486 --> 00:53:25,454
Daddy.

855
00:54:07,196 --> 00:54:09,981
- Hey, you.

856
00:54:09,999 --> 00:54:13,919
- Hey, you too.

857
00:54:17,673 --> 00:54:19,541
- Long day?

858
00:54:19,592 --> 00:54:21,793
- Oh.

859
00:54:21,827 --> 00:54:23,044
The longest.

860
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:26,798
- Mm.

861
00:54:26,832 --> 00:54:28,467
- Mm.

862
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:30,519
- They found that boy.

863
00:54:30,553 --> 00:54:35,607
- Well, do the police have
any idea what happened?

864
00:54:35,641 --> 00:54:38,676
- If they do,
they're not saying.

865
00:54:38,694 --> 00:54:42,481
Those parents must be
so relieved.

866
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:48,954
Do you hear that?

867
00:54:53,192 --> 00:54:54,960
- Crickets.

868
00:54:56,913 --> 00:54:59,548
For once,
the house is quiet.

869
00:55:00,716 --> 00:55:01,699
- Mm.

870
00:55:05,555 --> 00:55:06,838
- Jinxed it.

871
00:55:06,872 --> 00:55:08,006
- Hmm.

872
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,041
- I got this.
I got it.

873
00:55:10,059 --> 00:55:11,092
- No, but you're so tired.

874
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:13,145
- It's okay.

875
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:15,397
I want to.

876
00:55:23,689 --> 00:55:26,324
- Yeah, it's okay,
