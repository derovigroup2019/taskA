- Great. I'll drive.

186
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:22,234
If she won't talk,
maybe her apartment will.

187
00:09:22,234 --> 00:09:24,167
- I'll ride with you.
- No, absolutely not.

188
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,167
You're not searching
your own girlfriend's apartment.

189
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:27,501
Take Batista.

190
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:28,701
- Send him my way first.

191
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,834
I want both of you.

192
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:33,234
In your office. Now.

193
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:39,734
This is security footage

194
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:41,601
of a robbery
in coconut grove last night.

195
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:43,267
Fortunately,
our detectives

196
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:44,734
were able to I.D.
The suspect

197
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:46,200
and make an arrest.

198
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,000
But they sent this up to me

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,801
for a whole other reason.

200
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:51,234
A half hour before,

201
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:54,601
the security cameras
recorded this.

202
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,767
- Chief,
we were off duty, and...

203
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:04,300
- Two of my senior people

204
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,167
who had signed sworn affidavits
with the department

205
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,267
stating that there was

206
00:10:07,267 --> 00:10:08,868
no romantic involvement
between them.

207
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:10,234
- If you'd just let me
explain--

208
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,400
- there's nothing to explain.

209
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,033
You both lied under oath.

210
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:15,067
You committed perjury,
and that's a felony.

211
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:17,100
- Look, I understand
that we made a mistake,

212
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,434
and if necessary, we're willing
to accept the consequences,

213
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:21,100
but this is--
- you went back on your word,

214
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,834
and then you rubbed
my face in it.

215
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,834
Your board of review hearing
is the day after tomorrow.

216
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,734
I suggest
you call your union reps

217
00:10:27,734 --> 00:10:30,934
and start looking
into career alternatives.

218
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:32,934
- Wait a se--
hang on.

219
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:34,968
This isn't the first time

220
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,934
that you and I
have squared off,

221
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:39,300
so what exactly
is your beef with me?

222
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,300
My gender? My race?

223
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,968
What?

224
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:44,701
- Your arrogance.

- Lundy's trinity books.

226

of suspects over the years

a prostitute with a crowbar,

left her
on the side of the highway.

235
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:27,567
The chain of custody on
the crowbar was contaminated.

236
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:28,734
They dropped the case.

237
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:32,300

and when you heard Lundy
was on to your father,

364
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:22,400
you shot him.

365
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,067
- [Exhales]

366
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:31,834
I want to talk to my lawyer.

367
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:35,601
- First smart thing
you've said all day.

368
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:36,601
- She lied.

369
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:38,467
- Fuck yeah, she lied.

370
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:40,000
Just fucking admit it.

371
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,968
You shot me
and you killed Lundy.

372
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:43,934
- She fucking used me.

373
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:45,934
And I fell for it.

374
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:48,367
For her.

375
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:50,100
I'm a fuckin' asshole.

376
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,033
- Don't--don't do that.

377
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:54,133
- What?
- Beat yourself up like that.

378
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,467
- Why the fuck not?

379
00:18:57,467 --> 00:19:00,234
- Because I know
where it gets you.

380
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:02,167
I was engaged
to the ice truck killer.

381
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:04,467
Hello.

382
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:05,667
He cut people up,

383
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,067
drained their blood,

384
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:10,534
wrapped 'em up like
bloody fuckin' Christmas.

385
00:19:10,534 --> 00:19:12,801
Engaged.

386
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:16,434
As in ready to spend
the rest of my life.

387
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:17,501
- Yeah.

388
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:20,200
- So we can play
who's a bigger asshole,

389
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,300
but I guarantee you
I'll win.

390
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,167
- We're keeping Christine
overnight again.

391
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:27,400
- Good.
Let her fuckin' rot.

392
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:39,667
- Stan beaudry
lives off the grid.

393
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:45,167
A shack
in the middle of nowhere.

394
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:47,667
Lone wolf personified.

395
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,334

the driver's side door--

[shuts off radio]

402
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:17,801
- Where are you,
Mr. beaudry?

403
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,501
Making a delivery
in Jacksonville,

404
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:28,968
due back late tomorrow.

405
00:20:28,968 --> 00:20:30,534
Or if I leave now,

406
00:20:30,534 --> 00:20:32,167
I can be in Jacksonville
by midnight,

407
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:34,868
and cut the time...
And him...In half.

408
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:37,534
- You can't just disappear
all night, Dexter.

409
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:41,067
Got to get home
to your family.

410
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,267
- Hey.

411
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:49,400
It's late.

412
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,434
You can't sleep?

413
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:54,467
- I stayed up,
so we could finish our talk.

414
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:56,534
- Can it wait?

415
00:20:56,534 --> 00:20:58,634
I have a huge day tomorrow.

416
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:01,400
- No, it can't.

417
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,934
- Are the two of you--?

418
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:04,033
- No.

419
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,567
No, of course not.

420
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:08,033
It's just a huge mistake,

421
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,267
and I am so--so sorry.

422
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:11,968
- Well, okay then.

423
00:21:11,968 --> 00:21:15,834
Apology accepted.

424
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:17,868
- Shouldn't we
talk about this?

425
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:21,667
- I thought we just did.

426
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:24,567
- You didn't say anything.

427
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:26,968
- I'm putting it behind me.

428
00:21:26,968 --> 00:21:28,501
Isn't that
what I'm supposed to do?

429
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:30,234
- I mean, I'm glad,

430
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:32,167
but if I were you,

431
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:36,701
I would be hurt, angry,
disgusted even.

432
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:41,934
- Is that how
you want me to feel?

433
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:44,701
- No.

434
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:47,667
- Well, good.
See?

435
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:51,300
Everything is okay.

444
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:33,334
exactly what I'm doing
at his house--

445
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:34,534

- Arthur's DNA.

- If the police search
stan beaudry's house

448
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:40,300
and find those,

449
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,734
they'll think
he's the trinity killer.

450
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:45,501
- For a while, anyway.

451
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:48,534
- Long enough for me
to kill the real trinity.

- Dexter,
I need you at the station.

- Wow. I, um...

456
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,167
Kind of right in the middle
of doing some stuff.

457
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:00,734
Any chance
masuka can cover for me?

458

- No chance at all.
Be here.

Shit.

461

- You're juggling
too many people, Dexter.

462
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:13,400
- I know--arthur, beaudry,

463

Rita, now Batista...

464
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:18,267
- I'm not talking about them.

465
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:20,067
I mean Dexter Morgan--

Kyle Butler, extortionist?

Which one are you?

469
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:31,901
- All of them.

470
00:23:35,601 --> 00:23:38,234
- You still playing "who's
your daddy?" With Christine?

471
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:39,334
- I thought she'd come clean

472
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,734
after spending
a night in a cell.

473
00:23:40,734 --> 00:23:41,734
No such luck.

474

- Tell you what.

475
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:43,968
Before her lawyer gets here,

476
00:23:43,968 --> 00:23:46,200
let me take a shot at her.

477
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:53,300
I thought you might
want to refuel.

00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,400
Breakfast burrito.

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,734
- No, I don't eat that shit.

480
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:59,934
- I figured.
That's for me.

481
00:23:59,934 --> 00:24:02,634
- You put some kind of drug
in there to make me talk?

482
00:24:02,634 --> 00:24:07,000
- You watch way too much tv.

483
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I get it,
why you did what you did.

484
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:15,968
To protect your dad.

00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:18,801
I would have done
the same thing.

486
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:21,367
My dad and I were close too.

487
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,033
Actually, we weren't.

488
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:30,234
I wanted us to be,

489
00:24:30,234 --> 00:24:31,901
but he never noticed.

490
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:34,767
He was always too busy
with my brother and work.

491
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:35,868
- Is that why
you became a cop?

492

- Yes, actually.

493

- Hmm.

494

You thought that maybe,

00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,200
just maybe, if you became
a cop like him,

496
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,868
he'd give you that approval

497

you'd been so hungry for?

498
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:50,200
- Well, when you say it
like that,

499
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,868
it sounds like
a giant cliche.

500
00:24:51,868 --> 00:24:54,534
- That's because it is.

501
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:58,200
I don't want to talk about
your daddy issues, okay?

502
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,234
- Fine.

503
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:02,200
Let's talk about yours.

504
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,534
- Hmm.

505
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:06,601
Oh, you don't know
anything about me.

506
00:25:06,601 --> 00:25:09,601
- I know you can still do
the right thing.

507
00:25:12,701 --> 00:25:15,367
One day, I grew up.

508
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:18,701
And I realized my father
wasn't the end-all,

509
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:20,968
and it didn't matter
what he thought of me,

510
00:25:20,968 --> 00:25:22,667
because I realized
I didn't think that much

511
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:25,000
of him anymore either.

512
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,267
- You think
just because you shared,

513
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:36,701
I'm gonna open up?

514
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,701
You watch too much tv.

515
00:25:45,701 --> 00:25:47,067
- How'd it go?

516
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:49,067
- It didn't.

517
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:50,534
Now what?

518
00:25:50,534 --> 00:25:52,434
- Well, her lawyer's insisting
that we let her go.

519
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:55,100
- Let who go?

520
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,767
- Christine.

521
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:58,734
- Well, if she cares enough
about her father

522
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:00,033
to lie for him...

523
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:01,767
- He could be her first stop
if we cut her loose.

524
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,067
- Lead us right to him.

525
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:04,734
- You take care of this?
I got a meeting.

526
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:10,868
- I'm here.

527
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:13,033
- This is our witness?

- Uh, Dexter Morgan,
say hello to judge belford.

529
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:20,567

to sign here and here.

00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:22,300
And can I see some I.D.?

531
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:28,868
Well, these are the kind
of life sentences

532
00:26:28,868 --> 00:26:30,501
