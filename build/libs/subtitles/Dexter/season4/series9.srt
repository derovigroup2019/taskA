00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:47,183
<i>- previously on dexter...</i>

3
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:48,851
Judging from the spray,
we're looking at somebody tall.

4
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:50,319
Over six feet.

5
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:53,022
He moved the arm...
for a reason.

6
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:55,491
- the killer leaves
the ash as his signature,

7
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:57,026
Making his vics point at it.

8
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:59,278
Lundy came to miami
to hunt this guy.

9
00:01:59,312 --> 00:02:01,030
I think he got too close
and i think

10
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:03,332
It got him killed
and me shot.

11
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:04,984
- it's been my dad's baby
for years.

12
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:07,003
A few days ago,
he hands me the keys.

13
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:08,287
- no, no.

14
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:10,840
Smooth circular motions, son.

15
00:02:10,874 --> 00:02:12,125
- i got it, dad.

16
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,176
- if you got it,
i wouldn't have to remind you.

17
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,428
- small cracks
in the perfect family.

18
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:16,712
- i can lose my job.

19
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:17,847
Not like i'm the only one.

20
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:19,182
Being a journalist
these days

21
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:21,050
Is like a straight ticket
to the unemployment line.

22
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:25,972
Either i get a lead that bleeds
or basically i'm done.

23
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:28,340
Are the sweeps connected
to the shootings of agent lundy?

24
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:31,010
- i know it's really tough
for reporters right now.

25
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:33,146
So maybe instead of this one,
i can give you

26
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,231
That interview you've
been wanting from me.

27
00:02:35,282 --> 00:02:37,349
Mother shit fuck.

28
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:40,903
How tall was my shooter?

29
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:42,021
- my height.

30
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,873
- then it wasn't trinity.
- nope.

31
00:02:43,907 --> 00:02:46,576
- i was a dress-over-the-head
party girl.

32
00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:47,910
You must think i'm--

33
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:50,196
- totally charming.

34
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:51,914
- we broke up officially.

35
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:53,866
- if i find out
this is bullshit,

36
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:57,720
There will be severe,
career-ending consequences.

37
00:02:57,754 --> 00:02:59,338
- fuck it.

38
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:01,841
- no more confessions,
no more good deeds,

39
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:05,261
And no more fucking remorse.

40
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:11,217
No, you're mine.

41
00:03:11,235 --> 00:03:14,020
Arthur mitchell,
you just got a reprieve.

42
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:35,508
- this'll do the job.

43
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:38,911
Cut you into exactly
the right size pieces.

44
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:42,098
You got one more day.

45
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:53,726
[laughter]

46
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,279
Happy families are all alike.

47
00:03:56,313 --> 00:04:01,284
They never leave you
by yourself on holidays.

48
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:03,119
- so i got some interesting
thanksgiving greetings

49
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,487
From your coach davis.

50
00:04:04,538 --> 00:04:06,155
Well, if you're not gonna
play baseball anymore,

51
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:07,623
I suppose you aren't
gonna need this.

52
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:11,077
- no, dad--
- all right?

53
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:12,495
How about this?

54
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:13,996
Oh, you're full of awards.

55
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:17,416
- once the turkey's gone,
so is arthur.

56
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,584
- how about this one?

57
00:04:18,618 --> 00:04:21,120
This one's for most
valuable player.

58
00:04:27,627 --> 00:04:30,129
[car door closes
and engine turns]

59
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:35,017
- fuck you, dad.

60
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:37,687
[engine revs and tires screech]

61
00:04:37,738 --> 00:04:39,655
- family business.

62
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,108
- it's my business too.

63
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:54,503
- [grunting]

64
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,425
- okay.

65
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:02,345
Healthy way to blow off steam.

66
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:03,662
- [grunts]

67
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,381
- what the hell?

68
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:07,800
Jonah?

69
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,969
Hey, it's just me.

70
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:12,504
- mr. butler,
what are you doing here?

71
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:13,639
- i stopped by your house.

72
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:15,858
I saw you arguing
with your father.

73
00:05:15,892 --> 00:05:18,811
- no, i don't argue.
i never argue.

74
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:21,530
- still looked like a bad one.

75
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:24,183
- man, you have no idea
what he's like.

76
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:27,403
How he treats my mother
and rebecca.

77
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:29,372
You don't know
what he's capable of.

78
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:31,523
- well, actually--

79
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,524
- he hits me.

80
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,627
- that's not right.

81
00:05:37,164 --> 00:05:40,800
- you know, i'm running out
of cliches to tell the coaches.

82
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,835
You know,
"hey, i fell down some stairs.

83
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:45,704
I walked into a door."

84
00:05:49,343 --> 00:05:51,710
I know it looks like we have
the perfect fucking family,

85
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:54,096
But in that house,
when he's there,

86
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:55,514
It's not a life.

87
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:58,484
It's a tour of duty.

88
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:03,689
Shit.

89
00:06:03,723 --> 00:06:05,608
He'd kill me if he knew
i was telling you this stuff.

90
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:07,360
- i won't say a word.

91
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:14,233
- you should have just
let him die.

92
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:21,407
- where you going?

93
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:23,092
- anywhere away from here.

94
00:06:23,126 --> 00:06:25,378
I can't go back.

95
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:27,713
Not to him.
not with the car like this.

96
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:29,248
- so i'll go with you.

97
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:30,549
I'll be there
when you tell him.

98
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,802
- why?

99
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:35,438
- you're not the only one
with father issues.

100
00:06:38,258 --> 00:06:41,811
- well, you know,
maybe...

101
00:06:41,862 --> 00:06:44,897
I mean, i guess if you came
to thanksgiving tomorrow,

102
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:47,066
Dad would be on his best.

103
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,617
- thanksgiving?
- dinner's at 1:00.

104
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:52,154
I can stay at luke's house
until then.

105
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:54,990
- guess i'm having
two turkey dinners this year.

106
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:04,467
The dna sweep didn't
give them trinity.

107
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:07,052
But it did bring in
a cornucopia of criminals.

108
00:07:07,087 --> 00:07:09,255
That should keep miami metro
off the trinity case

109
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:11,257
Through the holiday.

110
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,259
Deb won't be anywhere
near as easy.

111
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:15,761
- i'm sorry, dex,
but i'm spending thanksgiving

112
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:17,430
With 90 or so
of my newest friends.

113
00:07:17,464 --> 00:07:19,148
Look at these victims.

114
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:20,599
It looks like
a family portrait.

115
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:23,102
The bathtub women,
they're always young and single.

116
00:07:23,136 --> 00:07:25,187
A first girlfriend maybe.

117
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:26,856
And then the jumper's always
a mother of two.

118
00:07:26,907 --> 00:07:28,858
Maybe that represents
his mom or his wife,

119
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,443
But i don't think
this guy's married.

120
00:07:30,477 --> 00:07:31,911
And the bludgeon-ee's
always a father.

121
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:35,080
- you used to love
thanksgiving when we were kids.

122
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:37,283
You wore the little
indian headdresses.

123
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:39,702
Picked the pearl onions
out of the green beans.

124
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:42,922
- yeah, mom's green beans.

125
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:45,174
And then she died.

126
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,825
And it was you and me
and dad and football

127
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:49,261
And tv dinners
in aluminum trays.

128
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:51,130
Talk about your lonely.

129
00:07:51,164 --> 00:07:53,432
- well, you won't
be lonely at our house.

130
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:54,666
You'll never get the chance.

131
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:58,437
- dexter,
i am lead detective

132
00:07:58,472 --> 00:08:00,022
On the biggest case
of my career.

133
00:08:00,056 --> 00:08:01,690
This is where i belong.

134
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:03,192
- i thought batista was lead.

135
00:08:03,226 --> 00:08:04,443
- he's the lead on lundy now.

136
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:05,978
Once we figured out trinity
didn't shoot me,

137
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:06,979
There was no conflict for me--
- what?

138
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:08,564
Wait.

139
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:10,566
Trinity didn't shoot you?

140
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:12,785
<i>- while you were at your
rain man convention,</i>

141
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:15,821
Masuka and i put it together
form the bullet's trajectory.

142
00:08:18,825 --> 00:08:19,875
- how did i not see that?

143
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,193
- we were too close.

144
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:22,378
That's what happens
when you make it personal.

145
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:23,629
- [sighs]

146
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:25,414
So i've heard.

147
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:28,367
So who shot you?

148
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:31,036
- maybe trinity knows.

149
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:32,671
I'll ask him when
i haul his ass in here.

150
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:37,760
- deb, you really, really need
to come to thanksgiving.

151
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:40,846
- tell the family i said,
"hi."

152
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,214
- all right, heads up,
everybody.

153
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:44,350
This dna sweep has been
like christmas.

154
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:46,485
We got hits
on three open rape cases

155
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,937
And one open burglary case.

156
00:08:47,988 --> 00:08:52,024
But best of all,
hits on two homicides.

157
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:53,943
Merry thanksgiving,
soderquist.

158
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:55,060
And this one is mine.

159
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:57,530
Keep up the good work,
guys.

160
00:08:57,564 --> 00:09:00,065
- sarge, any news
on any other cases?

161
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,534
- we'll find the fucker
who shot you.

162
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:03,235
You know that.

163
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:04,903
Focus on what you can control.

164
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,905
- catching trinity.

165
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:09,925
- catching trinity.

166
00:09:12,846 --> 00:09:15,881
[knocks on door]

167
00:09:15,915 --> 00:09:19,268
I heard the aclu's
filing suit on the sweeps.

168
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:23,472
- we've got maybe 72 hours
till we're shut down for good.

169
00:09:23,523 --> 00:09:25,090
We'll just have
to keep pushing harder.

170
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:26,892
- well, the holidays
may slow us down.

171
00:09:26,926 --> 00:09:28,310
We'll have a skeleton crew.

172
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:30,362
- i'll be here.

173
00:09:30,397 --> 00:09:33,265
Never been much for family
holidays anyway.

174
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:36,268
- particularly when they're
all still in cuba.

175
00:09:38,271 --> 00:09:40,656
- particularly.

176
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:42,941
You with auri tomorrow?

177
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,277
- she's with her moms
this year.

178
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:48,247
Plus i have a chance to close
an old case of mine, so...

179
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:52,951
- so i guess we'll both
be working thanksgiving.

180
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:56,338
- together.

181
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:58,624
- how unfortunate.

182
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:06,682
- put it up higher, mom.

183
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:07,766
- no, i want it lower.

184
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,935
- are happy families
all alike?

185
00:10:09,969 --> 00:10:12,271
- much better.

186
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:13,906
- dexter's home.
- oh, good.

187
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,324
They didn't run out of pies.

188
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:16,475
- here you go.

189
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:19,528
- [giggles]

190
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:21,647
- okay, bird, confess.

191
00:10:21,615 --> 00:10:23,282
How big are you?

192
00:10:23,316 --> 00:10:25,984
- 22 pounds.

193
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:27,703
- that's a lot of bird.

194
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:29,371
- better too much
than not enough.

195
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:31,006
I mean, that's what
the holiday's about.

196
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:35,094
That and family.

197
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:36,962
- about tomorrow...
- uh-oh.

198
00:10:36,996 --> 00:10:38,347
- it's not a big deal.

199
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:42,434
But the monroe county p.d.
needs a spatter interpretation

200
00:10:42,302 --> 00:10:45,471
On a bar fight and their
blood guy's in the bahamas.

201
00:10:45,505 --> 00:10:47,389
- [sighs]

202
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,525
- should just take
a few hours.

203
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,193
- does it have
to be tomorrow?

204
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:52,844
- well, that's when
the reconstruction is.

205
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:54,229
- mm.

206
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,181
- plus i'll be making
triple overtime.

207
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:58,033
- sure, that's a plus,

208
00:10:58,068 --> 00:10:59,568
But you'll be missing
all the fun.

209
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:01,070
- yeah.

210
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:03,739
- poor you.
poor us.

211
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,357
At least elliot will be here.

212
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,493
- yeah, good old elliot.

213
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:09,378
- so is deb coming?

214
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:11,530
- she's on the fence.

215
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:13,699
[sighs]

216
00:11:13,717 --> 00:11:16,168
- no, tell her that this is our
first family thanksgiving

217
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:17,869
And that we're
establishing traditions

218
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,755
That will shape our kids
and that they'll pass on

219
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:21,306
To their kids and
that she's a part of that.

220
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:22,925
An important part of that.

221
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:24,560
[grunts]

222
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:26,311
[sighs]

223
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:28,213
- rather than me
tell her all that...

224
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:30,315
Okay, guys,
now look real sad.

225
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:32,184
I mean, really miserable.

226
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:34,570
And...

227
00:11:34,604 --> 00:11:35,604
Action.
[cell phone beeps]

228
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:36,888
- hi, aunt deb.

229
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:38,273
We just heard
that you might not come

230
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:40,392
To thanksgiving dinner,
and well--

231
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,194
- we really want you
to come.

232
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:43,862
- look sad, retard.

233
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:45,063
- all right,
all right.

234
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:47,399
Just...
take two.

235
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:49,952
- will you please come over?

236
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:53,505
- fuck me.

237
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,958
[sighs]

238
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:06,585
You're here late.

239
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:09,254
- ah, didn't even notice.

240
00:12:09,272 --> 00:12:11,306
- big plans tomorrow?

241
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:13,142
- [chuckles]
you're looking at them.

242
00:12:13,193 --> 00:12:14,777
Whatever about tomorrow,
right?

243
00:12:14,811 --> 00:12:17,312
It's just another day
where people eat turkey.

244
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:20,432
I can eat turkey
any day of the year.

245
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,570
- dexter's having people over.

246
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:26,572
Well, me.
he invited me over.

247
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:28,774
- have a good time.

248
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:35,581
- you know...
[sighs]

249
00:12:35,615 --> 00:12:36,948
I could use a wingman.

250
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,133
- yes.

251
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:39,618
- i can't promise
it'll be any fun.

252
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:41,837
- well, i could be
your thigh man.

253
00:12:41,805 --> 00:12:42,954
[chuckles]

254
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:45,390
- don't press your luck.

255
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:47,426
I'll let rita know.

256
00:12:56,186 --> 00:12:57,236
- [exhales]

257
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,637
What time do you want
to eat tomorrow?

258
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:01,607
- oh, bad news, babe.
i got to work.

259
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:04,576
- oh.

260
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:06,361
Well, what time
do you get off?

261
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:08,163
- uh...

262
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:11,166
- you do want to spend
the holiday together, don't you?

263
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:13,252
- it's a holiday.

264
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:14,820
- [chuckles]
exactly.

265
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:19,124
- spending it together makes
things all...serious.

266
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:21,877
- ah, it's just
a casual thanksgiving

267
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:23,829
With your girlfriend.

268
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:25,798
- girlfriend?

269
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:30,435
That sounds really serious.

270
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,838
- joey...

271
00:13:32,856 --> 00:13:35,858
I don't want
to spend it alone.

272
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:39,278
[chuckles]

273
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:41,847
Plus, uh...

274
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:45,350
I make the best pecan pie
in the state of florida.

275
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:50,322
- i guess i could,
you know,

276
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:51,907
Come by for dessert.

277
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,710
- oh, so you just want
to eat my pie.

278
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:55,828
Is that it?

279
00:13:55,862 --> 00:13:57,830
- [chuckles]

280
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:13,645
- happy thanksgiving,
mr. mitchell.

281
00:14:13,513 --> 00:14:15,848
- happy thanksgiving.

282
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,251
- i'll be at arthur's by 1:00,
home by 4:00.

283
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:39,254
A serial killer's thanksgiving
recipe for success.

284
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:40,739
- how can none
of these be big enough?

285
00:14:40,757 --> 00:14:42,708
- well, maybe if we,
um...

286
00:14:42,742 --> 00:14:44,877
[imitating julia child]
turn the bird on its side

287
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:46,044
And then--and, um--
[laughter]

288
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:47,212
Hey, dex.

289
00:14:47,246 --> 00:14:49,298
- howdy, pilgrim.

290
00:14:49,349 --> 00:14:51,216
- did you hear that the pilgrims
didn't eat turkey

291
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,935
On the first thanksgiving?

292
00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:54,419
- really?

293
00:14:54,437 --> 00:14:57,806
- they ate corn and eel,
which the native americans

294
00:14:57,857 --> 00:14:59,758
Taught them to plant and fish.

295
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:01,259
- then the pilgrims
slaughtered them all,

296
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:03,111
Took their food,
and went to church the next day

297
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:08,617
To thank god
for all their good luck.

298
00:15:08,651 --> 00:15:11,153
- mm, it's a phase.
don't worry about it.

299
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:15,607
- what you said about traditions
shaping our kids...

300
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,493
My not going to work,
will that...misshape them?

301
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:19,878
- [scoffs]
look.

302
00:15:19,913 --> 00:15:22,214
I wish it was otherwise,
but you'll be home soon, right?

303
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:26,618
- right.
i just--

304
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:28,220
I don't want
to do any damage.

305
00:15:28,254 --> 00:15:30,756
- [chuckles]
you're a parent.

306
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,474
Parents do damage.

307
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:34,459
Hopefully we'll do enough
of the good stuff

308
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:36,228
To balance it out.

309
00:15:36,262 --> 00:15:39,130
- hopefully.

310
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:41,633
Thanks.

311
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,570
- "ashes to ashes..."

312
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:48,073
- doughnut to doughnut.

313
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:49,307
It's all the store
had left.

314
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:51,109
- what are you doing here?

315
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:52,611
- avoiding christine.

316
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:54,246
She can be a little intense.

317
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,081
- tell me about it.

318
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:58,483
She keeps calling to set
that interview with me.

319
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:00,085
- you said you'd do it.

320
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:02,821
- little busy here.

321
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,423
Look at the timing
of the trinity kills.

322
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:08,377
15 in december,
40 in july and august,

323
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:10,929
20 or so in the spring.

324
00:16:10,964 --> 00:16:12,180
What's the pattern?

325
00:16:12,215 --> 00:16:15,350
- long-haul truck driver?

326
00:16:15,385 --> 00:16:17,602
Migrant worker?

327
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:18,804
Some kind of salesman.

328
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:20,889
- yeah.

329
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,057
- gobble, gobble.

330
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:25,444
- she's nothing
if not persistent.

331
00:16:25,478 --> 00:16:27,029
- hey, babe.
what are you doing here?

332
00:16:27,063 --> 00:16:30,065
- i thought i'd bring
thanksgiving to you.

333
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:32,200
- how sweet.

334
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:33,485
- there's enough
for both of you.

335
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,570
- oh, thanks,
but i'm heading out.

336
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,823
- debra's taking the day off.

337
00:16:37,857 --> 00:16:39,708
- fuck that.
i'll be multitasking.

338
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:42,077
- well, i guess you can
take the day off too.

339
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:46,164
- sure he can.

340
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:49,668
- yeah, let me just, uh,
check with the boss.

341
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:53,672
We'll go eat.

342
00:16:53,706 --> 00:16:56,258
- so, debra,
how are you feeling?

343
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:58,143
- do you mind if we put off
that interview

344
00:16:58,177 --> 00:16:59,544
Until after the holiday?

345
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:01,930
- i'm not here as a reporter.

346
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:05,100
I'm here as joey's girlfriend.

347
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:07,352
- my condolences.

348
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:09,237
- [chuckles]

349
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:12,190
You know, he really cares
about you.

350
00:17:12,224 --> 00:17:15,277
After you got shot, you were
all he could talk about.

351
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:17,029
Really messed him up.

352
00:17:17,063 --> 00:17:18,697
- well, that makes
two of us.

353
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:20,832
- i just--

354
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:25,587
I just wanted to say,
um...

355
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:29,257
I'm really sorry about
what happened to you.

356
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:34,579
I can't even imagine
looking into the eyes

357
00:17:34,547 --> 00:17:37,749
Of the person you love...

358
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,768
Watching as he takes
his last breath.

359
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:46,424
- let's hope you never
have to.

360
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:49,094
- [exhales]

361
00:17:52,431 --> 00:17:54,616
[muffled conversation]

362
00:17:57,236 --> 00:17:59,571
- you got lloyd paulson
to confess?

363
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:02,941
- been waiting ten years
to close this one.

364
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,659
I promised
the victim's husband

365
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,578
I'd find the man
who killed his wife.

366
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:07,946
Finally lived up
to that promise.

367
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:10,048
- you should go
tell the husband.

368
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,666
Give him something
to be thankful for.

369
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,251
<i>- as soon as i process
that pendejo.</i>

370
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:15,120
Do you want to come with?

371
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:18,590
- to a next-of-kin
notification?

372
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:20,725
- it is official business.

373
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:29,184
[doorbell rings]

374
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:30,519
- kyle.

375
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,521
- happy thanksgiving.

376
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:34,656
- to you too.

377
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,141
- kyle.

378
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,609
What a nice surprise.

379
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:39,661
- apparently jonah didn't
mention inviting me.

380
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:43,832
I just wanted
to drop by and say hi.

381
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:48,820
It's my first thanksgiving
without my family and i...

382
00:18:48,838 --> 00:18:51,656
Didn't know what
to do with myself.

383
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,211
- i suppose you should eat
with us.

384
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:58,663
Full tables,
full hearts,

385
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:00,048
Full bellies.

386
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:03,001
Come on in.

387
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:04,970
[knock on door]

388
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:06,888
- aunt deb's here!

389
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:09,507
- happy thanksgiving,
turkeys.

390
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:12,894
Thanks for the video.

391
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,813
- hi, deb.
- hi, deb.

392
00:19:14,847 --> 00:19:16,448
- hi.

393
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:17,849
[whispers]
who's that?

394
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:19,901
- danny and grace's dad.
- danny, let me help.

395
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,019
You don't know where
that piece is.

396
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:22,787
- ah.

397
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:24,039
Where's dexter?

398
00:19:24,073 --> 00:19:25,857
- [sighs]
he's at some crime thing

399
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,025
In monroe county.

400
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:29,360
Said he'd be back for dinner.

401
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:30,829
- he's more like dad
every day.

402
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:31,880
- come look at our puzzle.

403
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:33,364
We've already got the corners.

404
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:35,200
- cody, leave her alone.

405
00:19:35,218 --> 00:19:36,701
- you don't want to help?

406
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,720
- i'm sorry, little man,
but i've got work to do.

407
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:40,755
- oh.

408
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,925
- [chuckles]

409
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:47,045
- you are good.

410
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:49,264
- another three hours to go.

411
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:50,515
- oh, when do you want
to put in

412
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:51,983
The broccoli-cheese
casserole?

413
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:53,735
- uh, about an hour before.

414
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:54,936
The sweet potatoes
need an hour

415
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:56,271
And the corn pudding needs
about 30 minutes.

416
00:19:56,322 --> 00:19:57,606
- is it all gonna fit?

417
00:19:57,657 --> 00:19:59,441
- [sighs]

418
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:01,026
No.

419
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,578
None of it's gonna fit.
what was i thinking?

420
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:04,946
- well, you were
thinking that,

421
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:07,398
"my fabulous neighbor has,
not one, but two ovens."

422
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,034
- [scoffs]

423
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:10,502
You know, you really are
a lifesaver.

424
00:20:10,536 --> 00:20:12,787
You should just wear
a red cross on your forehead.

425
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,122
- [chuckles]

426
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:16,091
[laughter]
oven crisis.

427
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,242
- deb, can you
watch the kids?

428
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,710
Harrison's asleep.

429
00:20:18,744 --> 00:20:20,595
- uh, actually, i was gonna
try to get some...

430
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,963
- oh!

431
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,765
- work done.

432
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,100
- vince, hi.

433
00:20:25,134 --> 00:20:26,801
Vince, elliot.
elliot, vince.

434
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:27,936
- hi.
uh, bye.

435
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,272
- uh, bye.

436
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:32,474
- bye.

437
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:33,725
- they're using his oven.

438
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,811
- oh, well, guess i'll be using
his oven too.

439
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:39,564
Chocolate lava cakes.
my specialty.

440
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:41,116
- you have a specialty?

441
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,785
- a river of chocolate love
that melts in your mouth.

442
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:44,953
- wow.

443
00:20:44,987 --> 00:20:46,788
You can make anything
sound perverted.

444
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:48,573
- it's a gift.

445
00:20:55,614 --> 00:20:57,966
- arthur seems to be
in a decent mood.

446
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,051
Maybe i'll be able
to slip out early.

447
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:01,452
It's almost 1:00.

448
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,804
You want me
to set the table?

449
00:21:02,838 --> 00:21:04,455
- no, we've got
to watch the game first.

450
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:05,974
- the game?
- yeah.

451
00:21:06,008 --> 00:21:07,259
It's tradition, kyle.

452
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:09,177
- ah.

453
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:12,130
Will the kids be joining us?

454
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:14,766
- that too would
be tradition,

455
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,486
But apparently jonah
has forgotten.

456
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:20,188
- i'm sure he's on his way.

457
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,807
He knows how important
holidays are to you.

458
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:30,031
- not such a decent mood
after all.

459
00:21:32,785 --> 00:21:36,204
- do you think rebecca
could come out now?

460
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:37,622
- i suppose.

461
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:39,624
I'll go get her.

462
00:21:42,762 --> 00:21:44,462
- she grounded or something?

463
00:21:44,496 --> 00:21:46,014
- oh, no.

464
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:48,717
No, nothing like that.

465
00:21:58,778 --> 00:22:00,812
- this is carl haas?

466
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:02,480
- he's been in a persistent
vegetative state

467
00:22:02,514 --> 00:22:04,649
For several years.

468
00:22:04,683 --> 00:22:06,318
Stepped off a sidewalk,

469
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:09,738
Got hit by a bus.

470
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:12,791
- i didn't know.

471
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:15,210
It's been a long time.

472
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:18,880
- would it be possible to have
a moment alone with him?

473
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:20,915
- have a good turkey day.

474
00:22:26,422 --> 00:22:28,673
- tell him.

475
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:30,091
- like he can hear me.

476
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:32,727
- he'll hear you.

477
00:22:42,405 --> 00:22:46,491
- mr. haas, i'm the one
who told you about your wife.

478
00:22:48,727 --> 00:22:52,063
I also promised
that i'd fi--

479
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:55,533
This is pointless.

480
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:59,754
- mr. haas,
angel knows how much

481
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:02,924
Your wife meant to you...

482
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,676
And he wants you to know...

483
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:16,221
- i want you to know...

484
00:23:16,255 --> 00:23:20,308
That we found
the guy who killed her.

485
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,593
I wish--

486
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:25,647
I wish we would have
found him sooner.

487
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:28,933
Really, i wish he would have
never killed your wife,

488
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:31,453
But i can't change that.

489
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,492
Can't change anything.

490
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:39,878
But we got the guy.

491
00:23:39,912 --> 00:23:42,414
We got him.

492
00:23:46,118 --> 00:23:48,086
- hello, mr. butler.
how are you?

493
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,454
- well, i'm fine, rebecca.

494
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:51,639
- kyle, you up for a little
pre-game football toss?

495
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:53,758
- i suppose.

496
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:56,177
- i'll go help mom
in the kitchen.

497
00:24:00,632 --> 00:24:03,318
- at least i have
one perfect child.

498
00:24:03,352 --> 00:24:05,653
- yeah, so it
would appear.

499
00:24:05,688 --> 00:24:07,689
- come on.

500
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,645
Normally jonah supplies
the football.

501
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:16,030
- how about baseball?

502
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:18,483
- no.
we throw the baseball in spring.

503
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:19,784
Thanksgiving
we throw the football.

504
00:24:19,818 --> 00:24:22,036
Traditions matter,
kyle.

505
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:24,672
- yes, they...

506
00:24:24,707 --> 00:24:26,007
Shape people.

507
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,125
- yeah,
and give children

508
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:29,461
A sense of history,
tradition.

509
00:24:29,545 --> 00:24:31,963
Teaches them who they are
and what's expected of them.

510
00:24:31,997 --> 00:24:34,665
- and what is expected of them?

511
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:37,335
- generosity,
common sense, obedience.

512
00:24:37,353 --> 00:24:40,054
It's a father's responsibility
to set the boundaries.

513
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:44,526
Child's duty to honor them.

514
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,110
No, there's nothing
down there.

515
00:24:46,145 --> 00:24:49,147
Stop!
kyle, no!

516
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:55,036
I made that...

517
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,155
When i was still confused.

518
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:02,710
- well, it's beautiful.

519
00:25:06,698 --> 00:25:09,700
- which is why i haven't
torn it apart.

520
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:12,837
Probably donate it
to the needy.

521
00:25:12,871 --> 00:25:15,039
Obviously i won't
be needing it.

522
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:17,342
- no, you'll be buried
at sea.

523
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:20,261
- i have a new lease
on life.

524
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:21,429
Thanks to you.

525
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,548
- [chuckles]

526
00:25:23,566 --> 00:25:26,384
Hey.

527
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:28,736
Huh.
the best laid plans.

528
00:25:28,771 --> 00:25:32,106
- it's jonah's.

529
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,275
What's the point of giving him
the better things in life

530
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:38,830
If he can't take care
of them?

531
00:25:44,954 --> 00:25:48,540
- what kind of father keeps
a coffin in his garage?

532
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:53,678
- what kind of father keeps
blood slides in his shed?

533
00:25:53,712 --> 00:25:55,430
- [sighs]

534
00:25:59,418 --> 00:26:00,885
Hey, we can still get some--

535
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,525
Here we go.

536
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,260
- dad, i don't know
what happened.

537
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:12,981
It was--the car was parked
in luke's driveway all night.

538
00:26:13,032 --> 00:26:14,866
I came out this morning and,
you know,

539
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,569
Someone had just gone
all mental on it.

540
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,289
Dad, i am so sorry.

541
00:26:21,323 --> 00:26:22,707
- [sighs]

542
00:26:22,741 --> 00:26:25,577
That's why god invented
car insurance, right?

543
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:38,723
It'll be okay.

544
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,662
- there.

545
00:27:00,696 --> 00:27:04,365
Now it's drivable
till we can get her fixed.

546
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,751
Well...

547
00:27:06,785 --> 00:27:08,086
Game's about to start.

548
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,371
Shall we?

549
00:27:17,046 --> 00:27:18,262
- come on, danny.

550
00:27:18,297 --> 00:27:19,764
Throw it here.

551
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:21,099
- oh, good one.

552
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,885
- hey, you two.
no wiffle ball in the house.

553
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:25,836
- i don't know how you do it.

554
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,605
All these kids
at home at the same time.

555
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,007
- [chuckles]
thanksgiving's only four days.

556
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:31,309
You should try keeping
them entertained

557
00:27:31,343 --> 00:27:32,610
For three months
in the summer.

558
00:27:32,645 --> 00:27:34,979
- yeah, plus spring break
and christmas break.

559
00:27:35,013 --> 00:27:37,448
- that's when you're really
climbing the walls.

560
00:27:37,483 --> 00:27:41,869
- june, july, august...

561
00:27:41,904 --> 00:27:43,821
December.

562
00:27:43,855 --> 00:27:46,207
Oh...

563
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:48,076
Fu-u-udge.

564
00:27:48,127 --> 00:27:50,044
Trinity's
in the school system.

565
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,996
- probably a gain of about--
- quinn.

566
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,197
- joey, it's deb.

567
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:55,166
His kill schedule matches
the school year.

568
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,718
Trinity could be a janitor.

569
00:27:56,752 --> 00:27:58,920
He could be a cafeteria worker,
a bus driver,

570
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:00,421
A teacher or principal.

571
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:01,923
We got to get
to the station.

572
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:03,508
- i haven't eaten yet.

573
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:05,510
- jesus, grab a drumstick
to go.

574
00:28:05,544 --> 00:28:07,378
- deb, no one's
working today

575
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:08,379
And we're gonna
need a warrant

576
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:09,981
To access
any school databases.

577
00:28:10,015 --> 00:28:11,599
- we can find a judge.

578
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,101
- yeah, who's gonna love us
for tearing him

579
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:14,218
Away from his family.

580
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:15,269
Come on.

581
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,722
We're not gonna get
anywhere today.

582
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,907
- [sighs]
fu--

583
00:28:19,942 --> 00:28:21,559
Fudge.

584
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:22,744
[cell phone beeps]

585
00:28:22,778 --> 00:28:24,696
- break in a case?

586
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,414
- we'll see.

587
00:28:26,448 --> 00:28:30,418
- [sighs]

588
00:28:30,452 --> 00:28:33,421
Not a horrible thanksgiving,
right?

589
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:36,407
- no, actually,
it's kind of nice.

590
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:38,042
- you sound surprised.

591
00:28:38,076 --> 00:28:40,294
- i am a little.

592
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:41,879
- hmm.

593
00:28:41,913 --> 00:28:45,249
So having a girlfriend isn't
so bad after all?

594
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:46,718
- you with the labels.

595
00:28:46,752 --> 00:28:48,085
- [sighs]

596
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,920
- why does it matter?

597
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:53,424
- i just--

598
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:55,593
I care about you.

599
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:57,945
I'd kind of like
to have it returned.

600
00:29:00,766 --> 00:29:02,734
- come here.

601
00:29:07,272 --> 00:29:11,576
- [whispers]
i have a better idea.

602
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,277
- aww.

603
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:15,613
You are so my girlfriend.

604
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:17,615
- [laughs]

605
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:22,787
- get--get--

606
00:29:22,805 --> 00:29:24,088
Get him!
get him!

607
00:29:24,122 --> 00:29:25,456
Get--get--get--
get him!

608
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:26,891
Ah!

609
00:29:26,925 --> 00:29:28,392
- oh, it's okay.

610
00:29:28,427 --> 00:29:29,727
They didn't get
the first down.

611
00:29:29,762 --> 00:29:30,978
- [sighs]

612
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:32,897
- jonah seems safe
for the moment.

613
00:29:32,931 --> 00:29:34,816
I'm not a big football fan.

614
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,468
I think i'll go see
if i can help sally.

615
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:41,105
- oh, that's very
nice of you.

616
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:46,661
- look at that.
there's three men on him.

617
00:29:46,695 --> 00:29:49,113
- yeah, i know.

618
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:54,652
- this room's kind of young
for a teenager.

619
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:02,176
Are those to keep
someone out

620
00:30:02,211 --> 00:30:05,179
Or keep someone in?

621
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:17,942
My god.
he locks his daughter in here.

622
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:22,012
[door closes]

623
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:31,289
You need any help?

624
00:30:31,323 --> 00:30:34,292
I'm completely useless
in the kitchen.

625
00:30:34,326 --> 00:30:35,910
- sure.

626
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:38,996
Uh, something
for the centerpiece.

627
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,665
Roses.

628
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:41,699
Dad always likes these.

629
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:43,668
- everything for dad, huh?

630
00:30:43,702 --> 00:30:46,003
- [scoffs]

631
00:30:46,037 --> 00:30:49,140
Those locks on your door
for him too?

632
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,982
- he says they're there
to protect me.

633
00:30:58,016 --> 00:30:59,684
- do they?

634
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:05,523
- third down.

635
00:31:05,557 --> 00:31:06,824
- he's open.
he's open!

636
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:08,192
Go, go!

637
00:31:08,226 --> 00:31:10,111
Touchdown!
- oh!

638
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:12,229
- what a play.

639
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:24,592
- no.
no, dad.

640
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:29,597
Ow!
[muffled scream]

641
00:31:29,631 --> 00:31:31,632
[grunts]

642
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:37,021
- and that's
for my windshield.

643
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:43,311
Things of beauty need
to be honored.

644
00:31:55,607 --> 00:31:57,458
- i ran away once.

645
00:31:57,492 --> 00:32:00,494
He caught me and...

646
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:01,712
It was bad.

647
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:04,215
- it's not always
gonna be like this.

648
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:08,219
- [scoffs]

649
00:32:08,253 --> 00:32:11,639
Jonah told me
that you're helping him.

650
00:32:11,673 --> 00:32:13,391
- yeah, if you can call
it that.

651
00:32:13,425 --> 00:32:15,893
- you can help me too.

652
00:32:15,928 --> 00:32:18,462
Get me out of here.

653
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:20,932
- you just need
to wait a while.

654
00:32:20,966 --> 00:32:25,636
You're too young
to be on your own.

655
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:29,190
- i don't have
to be on my own.

656
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,192
I could be with you.

657
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:32,777
<i>- with me?</i>

658
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:37,448
- jonah also says you're nice.

659
00:32:37,482 --> 00:32:39,149
- i try to be.

660
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,619
- if you're nice to me,

661
00:32:41,653 --> 00:32:44,755
I can be nice to you.

662
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,341
I'll do anything you want.

663
00:32:47,376 --> 00:32:49,377
- whoa.
i don't--

664
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:52,663
Rebecca, you're 15.

665
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:55,016
I don't want anything
from you.

666
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,468
- i don't believe you.

667
00:32:57,502 --> 00:32:58,602
Look, i know what guys like.

668
00:32:58,637 --> 00:33:01,055
- no.
- rebecca?

669
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:03,441
Go inside.

670
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:11,615
- sally, it's not--
- shh.

671
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,485
I am so sorry
about rebecca's behavior.

672
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,153
- oh.

00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:20,992
- just please don't say
anything to arthur.

674
00:33:23,695 --> 00:33:25,963
Kyle, you can't.

675
00:33:25,998 --> 00:33:27,882
Whatever you did
with rebecca...

676
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:29,300
- i didn't.

677
00:33:29,334 --> 00:33:30,584
- whatever you're
going to do,

678
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:31,752
I don't care.

679
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:33,888
Just please,
i'm begging you.

680
00:33:33,922 --> 00:33:36,040
Don't tell him.
- i wouldn't.

681
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:38,642
I wouldn't.
i won't.

682
00:33:38,677 --> 00:33:40,878
- please.

683
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:43,347
- yeah, i promise.

684
00:33:43,381 --> 00:33:45,382
- thank you.

685
00:33:53,692 --> 00:33:56,911
- what the hell is he doing
to these people?

[cell phone rings]

687
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:03,000
Rita, hi.

688
00:34:03,035 --> 00:34:04,902
- hey.
how far away are you?

689
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,089
- uh, probably
about an hour or so.

690
00:34:08,123 --> 00:34:09,840
- all right, well,
i don't want you to be surprised

691
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:10,875
When you get home.

692
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,009
- why?
what?

693
00:34:12,044 --> 00:34:13,094
- cody fell into your shed.

694
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:14,411
- what?
is he okay?

695
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,013
What happened?
- well, he's fine.

696
00:34:16,047 --> 00:34:18,432
He hit a wiffle ball
onto the top of the shed,

697
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:21,185
Climbed up to get it,
the skylight cracked...

698
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,853
And he fell through.

699
00:34:22,888 --> 00:34:25,606
Elliot was gonna push
on the air conditioner.

700
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,058
- no, don't.

701
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:29,060
- uh, he didn't.

702
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:31,428
He took off the door
with an axe.

703
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:33,864
- so my shed has no door?

704
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:35,766
- dexter, cody was scared
and crying, all right?

705
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:37,868
I told elliot to get him
out however he could.

706
00:34:37,903 --> 00:34:39,236
- yeah, of course.
of course.

707
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,155
I'll...

708
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:42,873
Thank elliot when i get home.

709
00:34:42,908 --> 00:34:44,742
- well, i'll see you soon,
okay?

710
00:34:44,776 --> 00:34:47,661
- [sighs]

711
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:50,631
No one can get into
the trunk's false bottom.

712
00:34:50,665 --> 00:34:53,417
- you didn't think anyone could
get into your shed either.

713
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:56,971
- i gotta get home now.

00:35:09,768 --> 00:35:12,436

00:35:13,972 --> 00:35:17,474

729
00:35:51,342 --> 00:35:53,644
Carl haas's wife gets mugged.

730
00:35:53,678 --> 00:35:55,396
Boom.
she's dead.

731
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:56,730
Carl gets hit by a bus.

732
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:58,782
Boom.
he's a vegetable.

733
00:36:01,403 --> 00:36:03,320
- you never know when you
wake up in the morning

734
00:36:03,354 --> 00:36:04,321
What the day will bring.

735
00:36:04,355 --> 00:36:07,408

736
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:11,629
I love you.

737
00:36:18,036 --> 00:36:19,420
- are you saying that
because you're afraid

738
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:20,671
You'll get hit by a bus?

739
00:36:20,705 --> 00:36:22,506
- no. well...

740
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:26,677
Yes, but...

741
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:29,897
I just want you to know
what i know

742
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:31,515
Before i don't know it
anymore.

743
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:38,022
And i love you.

744
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:39,240

- you don't love me?

750
00:37:01,963 --> 00:37:06,183
- i'm afraid
if i say it...

751
00:37:06,218 --> 00:37:08,919
Something will happen,
like you'll get hit by a bus.

752
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:26,370
So watch out
for moving buses.

764
00:38:00,188 --> 00:38:02,773

Did you say, "rats"?

772
00:38:17,956 --> 00:38:19,373
- [chuckles]

773
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:21,375
I guess i've been spending
too much time with the kids.

774
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:23,260
- [chuckles]

775
00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:25,596

780
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,784
- well, no,
it's just

781
00:38:46,818 --> 00:38:48,619
We have this connection
and it's not just because

782
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:49,853
We're both lonely--

783
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:51,238
- no, i'm not lonely.

784
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:52,706

785
00:38:52,741 --> 00:38:54,958

Not feeling so hot.

789

You're my wingman.

really need me around.

793

I'll see you at the--
- no, no, shh!

794
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:30,110
You belong here
as much as anyone does.

795
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:33,230
And if you go, i'll be
the one single person here.

796
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:34,365
I really don't feel like
remembering

797
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:37,567
Why that is, you know?

798
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:39,403
Why frank's gone.

799
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:40,754
Why i'm here.

800
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:42,072

told me not to talk to?

807
00:40:05,397 --> 00:40:08,398
- awkward.

808
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,950

Family tradition, kyle,

819
00:40:29,971 --> 00:40:33,290
Before we start...

820
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:37,127
Of saying what
we're thankful for.

00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:38,228
I'll start.

822
00:40:38,263 --> 00:40:40,814

Who is growing up

I am so blessed.

834
00:41:15,049 --> 00:41:17,217

[laughter]

838
00:41:23,024 --> 00:41:28,145
And i'm also thankful

Did you say you were thankful
for me, jonah?

852
00:42:19,447 --> 00:42:20,664
What's that?

853
00:42:20,698 --> 00:42:24,868
- i did not say
i was thankful for you...

854
00:42:24,902 --> 00:42:28,071
Because i'm not.

855
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:31,241

for you to go.

And she's not

867
00:42:49,978 --> 00:42:51,895
This whole life--

Your life--
is a lie!

869
00:42:54,148 --> 00:42:56,766
These are lies!

Oh, my god!

895
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:05,686
Arthur!

896
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:10,807
- sally.

897
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:13,009
- [grunting]

898
00:44:13,027 --> 00:44:15,445
Thankful to be out
of that fucking house!

899
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,864
- you showed trinity
the monster in you.

900
00:44:17,899 --> 00:44:19,316
He'll see you coming now.

901
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,485
- i don't know.
seeing them like that--

902
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:23,520
He's destroyed everyone
in that family.

903
00:44:23,538 --> 00:44:26,022
- that's what happens to people
who live with a monster.

904
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,076
- i am nothing like him!

905
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:30,744
My family is nothing
like that.

906
00:44:30,795 --> 00:44:32,879
- what's 18 more years of being
with you gonna do to them?

907
00:44:32,914 --> 00:44:36,366
- arthur's terrorized them
into maintaining his cover.

908
00:44:36,384 --> 00:44:38,335
They're nothing
but human shields.

909
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:42,673
- the only reason you started
dating rita was for cover.

910
00:44:42,707 --> 00:44:44,474
- [sighs]

911
00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:46,009
She's much more than that now.

912
00:44:46,043 --> 00:44:49,012
She and the kids.
much more.

913
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:56,019
My family is nothing
like that.

914
00:45:00,224 --> 00:45:02,025
Hey.
- hey.

915
00:45:02,059 --> 00:45:03,610
- dexter's home!

916
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:04,611
- who's hungry?

917
00:45:04,662 --> 00:45:06,363
- me.
- i am.

918
00:45:06,397 --> 00:45:09,583
- i am so happy
you're home.

919
00:45:09,617 --> 00:45:11,785
- oh, me too.

920
00:45:11,836 --> 00:45:13,036
- mm.

921
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,905
Mm.

922
00:45:15,923 --> 00:45:17,924
[chuckles]
all right.

923
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:20,711
Uh, cody, why don't you help
your aunt deb set the table?

924
00:45:20,745 --> 00:45:25,098
Astor, i can use your help
in the kitchen.

925
00:45:25,133 --> 00:45:27,634
- sorry about your shed,
dexter.

926
00:45:27,685 --> 00:45:30,554
- hey.

927
00:45:30,588 --> 00:45:31,938
Huh.

928
00:45:31,973 --> 00:45:35,358
As long as you're okay,
that's all that matters.

929
00:45:38,596 --> 00:45:40,397
[sighs]
i'm gonna go check on the shed.

930
00:45:40,431 --> 00:45:42,566
Make sure it's safe in there.

931
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,902
- miss us?

932
00:45:45,936 --> 00:45:47,654
- you have no idea.

933
00:45:56,664 --> 00:45:58,999
God, i miss my apartment.

934
00:46:04,789 --> 00:46:06,757
[sighs]

935
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:08,759
They're safe.

936
00:46:08,793 --> 00:46:10,727
So's my trunk.

937
00:46:14,899 --> 00:46:16,983
- is anything
really safe here?

938
00:46:17,068 --> 00:46:21,772
The kids, rita?

939
00:46:21,806 --> 00:46:22,939
You?

940
00:46:22,973 --> 00:46:25,492
- i'll find an alternative.

941
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:32,649
- trinity was supposed
to be the alternative.

942
00:46:38,989 --> 00:46:42,626
- uh, spoons go inside
or outside the knives?

943
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,011
- um...

944
00:46:45,046 --> 00:46:48,164
Surprise us.

945
00:46:48,182 --> 00:46:49,165
Ouch.

946
00:46:49,183 --> 00:46:51,668
- can i see your scars,
aunt deb?

947
00:46:54,171 --> 00:46:56,139
- sure.

948
00:46:59,176 --> 00:47:01,695
- does it still hurt?

949
00:47:01,729 --> 00:47:05,115
- um...

950
00:47:05,149 --> 00:47:08,068
Sometimes...

951
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:09,352
Here.

952
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:14,374
- did you see that guy die?

953
00:47:14,408 --> 00:47:16,910
- i did.

954
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:18,528
Looked right in his eyes.

955
00:47:18,546 --> 00:47:20,247
- were his eyes open?

956
00:47:20,298 --> 00:47:23,834
- yeah.

957
00:47:23,868 --> 00:47:26,870
Watched him take his
last breath.

958
00:47:31,175 --> 00:47:32,392
How did she know that?

959
00:47:32,426 --> 00:47:34,344
- how did who know what?

960
00:47:34,378 --> 00:47:38,181
- nobody but me.

961
00:47:38,215 --> 00:47:40,567
How much did you tell christine
about the lundy shooting?

962
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:41,902
- nothing.

963
00:47:41,936 --> 00:47:43,436
- well, maybe you left
lundy's file

964
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:44,721
Lying around accidentally.

965
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:45,906
- no.

966
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,224
- and maybe christine saw some
of the pictures.

967
00:47:48,242 --> 00:47:50,026
She saw how he was lying
on his side,

968
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,611
How he fell in front of me,
so that i could see him

969
00:47:51,662 --> 00:47:53,029
Take his last--

970
00:47:53,063 --> 00:47:55,949
- morgan, i'm telling you,
i learned my lesson.

971
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,834
I never even took the lundy
files out of the station.

972
00:47:57,869 --> 00:47:59,586
There's no way she
could have seen it.

973
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:07,961
- dinner's ready.

974
00:48:08,012 --> 00:48:11,932
- not all happy families
are alike.

975
00:48:11,966 --> 00:48:14,517
They are happy...

976
00:48:14,552 --> 00:48:16,720
Aren't they?

977
00:48:16,754 --> 00:48:20,140
Are they normal kids?

978
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:25,395
How can you tell a loving wife
from a frightened one?

979
00:48:25,429 --> 00:48:27,731
A friendly neighbor.

980
00:48:27,765 --> 00:48:29,616
Co-worker.

981
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,484
Sister.

982
00:48:31,535 --> 00:48:34,571
Son.

983
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:37,574
Are any of them
what they seem?

984
00:48:37,608 --> 00:48:41,945
Or are they little bombs
waiting to explode?

985
00:48:41,963 --> 00:48:45,498
- happy thanksgiving, son.

986
00:48:45,549 --> 00:48:49,169
- dexter?
everything okay?

987
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,588
- yeah.

988
00:48:51,622 --> 00:48:53,089
It is, isn't it?
[sighs]

989
00:48:53,123 --> 00:48:55,792
- yes.

990
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:59,145
Everything is exactly
the way it should be.

991
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,899
Perfect.

992
00:49:02,934 --> 00:49:04,401
- yeah, you're right.

993
00:49:04,435 --> 00:49:05,819
- why don't we go around
the table and everybody

994
00:49:05,853 --> 00:49:06,937
Say what they're thankful for?

995
00:49:06,971 --> 00:49:09,272
- no!

996
00:49:09,306 --> 00:49:11,808
I don't want this yummy food
to get cold.

997
00:49:11,826 --> 00:49:14,277
- i'm thankful for dexter.

998
00:49:19,316 --> 00:49:22,285
- let's eat.

999
00:49:26,123 --> 00:49:27,674
- sure you don't want to stay?

1000
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:29,376
- i'm too tired
to spend the night.

1001
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:30,710
You made sure of that.

1002
00:49:30,761 --> 00:49:33,430
- [chuckles]

1003
00:49:33,464 --> 00:49:35,164
- see you tomorrow?

1004
00:49:35,182 --> 00:49:38,551
- and the day after that
and after that.

1005
00:49:41,055 --> 00:49:43,273
I'm here if you
change your mind.

1006
00:49:43,307 --> 00:49:45,025
- good night.

1007
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:48,028
- good night.

1008
00:49:56,654 --> 00:50:00,657
[sighs]

1009
00:50:00,691 --> 00:50:03,660
[knock on door]

1010
00:50:03,694 --> 00:50:05,662

Hi, dad.
