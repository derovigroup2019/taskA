1
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:13,584
Last season on Dexter...

2
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:17,622
The butchered bodies were
submerged inside these garbage bags...

3
00:00:17,748 --> 00:00:20,248
Did you hear that?
30 bags. Do you know what that means?

4
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,075
There might be
a new mass murderer out there

5
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:24,591
- way worse than the Ice Truck Killer.
- Uh-oh.

6
00:00:24,713 --> 00:00:27,473
Eight confirmed victims
of the Bay Harbor Butcher.

7
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:30,011
That's what the press is calling
whoever dumped those bodies offshore.

8
00:00:30,135 --> 00:00:32,385
Last thing Miami needs
is another serial killer.

9
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:36,432
- Any idea who the FBI is sending?
- Some guy named Lundy.

10
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:39,188
We have positive IDs
on all 18 of our complete bodies.

11
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:42,941
All 13 were either tried for murder
or at least suspected of murder.

12
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:46,435
Bay Harbor Butcher? Give me one
shot, I'd put a bullet in the fucker's head.

13
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:47,648
You really feel that way?

14
00:00:47,778 --> 00:00:49,858
If Dad taught us one thing,
it's the value of human life.

15
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:52,278
Yeah, but I think we had
different homework assignments.

16
00:00:55,118 --> 00:00:58,408
Tell me the truth.
Are you an addict?

17
00:00:58,539 --> 00:00:59,959
Yes, I have an addiction.

18
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:01,872
- I'm Dexter.
- Hi, Dexter.

19
00:01:02,459 --> 00:01:03,999
There's my sponsor.

20
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:07,957
So tell me, exactly how full of shit are you?

21
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,630
This woman sees me.

22
00:01:09,758 --> 00:01:12,798
Somehow she's able to make me feel OK
about what I am.

23
00:01:12,928 --> 00:01:16,508
You're going to tell me
all your deepest, darkest secrets.

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,680
Laura Moser, my mother,
she was murdered.

25
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,890
I've never told anyone that before.

26
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,730
Did you find out what happened to the
men responsible for your mother's murder?

27
00:01:25,858 --> 00:01:29,648
Santos Jimenez. Turned state's evidence,
went into witness protection.

28
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:31,698
- Where are you?
- I've decided to look up

29
00:01:31,822 --> 00:01:33,162
someone from my past.

30
00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:35,032
1976!

31
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:38,198
You slaughtered her
cause she stole cocaine.

32
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:41,078
She was a snitch for a cop.
She was fucking him.

33
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:45,286
It seems my foster father and
my biological mother were having an affair.

34
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:48,669
Did he blame himself for her death?
Is that why he took me in?

35
00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:51,337
Or was he just using her?
Was he using me?

36
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:54,386
But there ain't no paper trail
on the early years of Dexter Morgan.

37
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:56,971
Your past is a bigger mystery
than fucking Jimmy Hoffa.

38
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:59,717
Back... off.

39
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,480
Ow! Fuck!

40
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:07,186
If Dexter files a complaint,
you will be kicked off the force.

41
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:09,396
He's hiding something, Maria.
I can feel it.

42
00:02:09,526 --> 00:02:11,066
I need some blood slides analyzed.

43
00:02:11,194 --> 00:02:13,534
I'm about to be found out
at work for what I really am.

44
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:16,405
- You don't understand.
- Why don't you make me?

45
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:26,041
- Who the fuck are you?
- Oh, pardon my tits.

46
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:29,498
How could you do this to Rita,
not to mention her kids?

47
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,880
You and Lila
stayed in a hotel together.

48
00:02:32,007 --> 00:02:33,837
It's over, Dexter.

49
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:38,467
I'm sure that you heard we have a suspect
in the Bay Harbor Butcher case.

50
00:02:38,597 --> 00:02:39,887
Sergeant James Doakes.

51
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:41,385
He had the slides.

52
00:02:41,516 --> 00:02:43,886
Carefully hidden in the trunk of his car
at the airport.

53
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:46,599
Jesus Christ, Morgan.
You're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

54
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,020
You sure about that?
You might want to check with Lundy.

55
00:02:54,237 --> 00:02:57,447
What's it gonna be, Morgan?
Kill me now or set me free!
