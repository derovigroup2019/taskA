<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,559
It's always the same
three kills with Trinity.

4
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,361
Young woman in the bathtub...

5
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,448
followed by a mother
falling to her death.

6
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,236
And ending with a man
getting bludgeoned.

7
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,454
Trinity's likely someone

8
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,957
who's gone his own
solitary way through life,

9
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,625
foregone all but the most rudimentary

10
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,244
of human connections.

11
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:08,628
A lone wolf.

12
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:11,047
If we can find where he
bludgeoned back then...

13
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:14,384
Lobby's open 24 hours, guard on duty.

14
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:16,002
Too much foot traffic.
Trinity would have

15
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,754
to choose another floor.

16
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,222
Ooh, so sorry.

17
00:02:19,257 --> 00:02:21,374
Wasn't watching where I was going.

18
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:22,542
White male,

19
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,210
eyes blue,

20
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,846
something in them.

21
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,215
Super agent Lundy has a
hunch that the dead woman

22
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,050
is connected to this
big serial killer case.

23
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,052
You still dating that she-bag reporter?

24
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,404
After she put Lundy's name in the paper?

25
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:35,906
Tell me, is this conversation

26
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,223
going to end up in the paper too?

27
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,358
'Cause you have no idea

28
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,993
the shit storm you've gotten me into.

29
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,444
Find yourself another source.

30
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,948
Just unsealed the juvie
records of Johnny Rose,

31
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,333
our vacation murder suspect.

32
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,952
Shoplifting with his high
school girlfriend Nikki Wald.

33
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,086
Get down!

34
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:51,955
I think we should inform the brass

35
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,006
about our relationship.

36
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,741
It's none of their business.

37
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,093
I get a gig in town to
spend more time with you,

38
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:59,012
and you spend all your time

39
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,246
with your ex.

40
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:05,251
Don't go disappearing on me again.

41
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,971
Not a...

42
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,123
- Deb.
- Hey, you.

43
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,176
- Back behind the line.
- No, I was called here.

44
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,677
I'm Dexter Morgan.
That might be my sister.

45
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,062
I understand, Sir, but
right now I need you

46
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,563
to step back and let
our people do their job.

47
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,565
No, no, I'm with Miami Metro Forensics.

48
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,317
My laminate and my
wallet are in the car.

49
00:03:54,352 --> 00:03:56,186
Until I see some ID,
I need you to step back.

50
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:57,487
And I need you to fucking listen.

51
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:58,738
My sister was shot,

52
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:00,357
No one can tell me
what her condition is,

53
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:01,641
and that's a dead body.

54
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,159
Sir.

55
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:05,528
You want to let me go.

56
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,530
Hansen. Hands off.

57
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,667
He's one of us.

58
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:13,152
Deb's alive. Okay?

59
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,988
They're taking her to the hospital.

60
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:16,873
I have to see her.

61
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,375
How bad is it?

62
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:19,926
Lost a lot of blood.

63
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:26,499
If Deb dies,

64
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:28,768
I'll be...

65
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:30,220
lost.

66
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:32,605
Paramedics think the bullets
are through and through.

67
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,890
She's gonna be okay?

68
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:34,891
It's looking good.

69
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,946
Who did this?

70
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:41,681
We got here just before you did.

71
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,117
Quinn was first on scene.

72
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:48,121
He says it's smelling like
the vacation murders' MO.

73
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:49,122
Then that's...

74
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,374
Lundy.

75
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:02,302
What was Deb doing with
Lundy at 5:00 in the morning?

76
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,970
Oh.

77
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:05,972
Dexter, I swear to you,
we will find who did this.

78
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:08,591
My kit's in my car.

79
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,592
Hey, hey, hey.

80
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,927
You got better places to be.

81
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,312
Like with your sister.

82
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,097
Go. That's an order.

83
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:17,100
You'll know the minute we know anything.

84
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,656
Lundy was a worthy adversary.

85
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:24,858
He deserves better

86
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:29,162
than to be face down
in a hotel parking lot,

87
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,581
a random victim of a senseless crime.

88
00:05:31,615 --> 00:05:34,617
Sorry about Deb, man.

89
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,618
Did she say anything?

90
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,870
She was in shock,

91
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,071
didn't see who pulled the trigger.

92
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,422
Batista said you think

93
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:40,740
this looks like the vacation murders.

94
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,509
Deb's cash and credit cards are gone.

95
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,744
So's Lundy's watch and wallet.

96
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:53,470
Anything, Vince?

97
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:56,106
Surgeon general wouldn't
have been able to save him.

98
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,225
GSWs to the neck and chest.

99
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,276
He bled out in seconds.

100
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:03,229
Lundy was shot twice?

101
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,616
Deb was vulnerable and
a potential witness.

102
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,937
The shooter could have easily
finished her off like Lundy.

103
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:12,605
I should get to the hospital.

104
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,941
Deb, she knows.

105
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,743
Even though we go at it all the time,

106
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,295
We're still...

107
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,715
Yeah, she knows.

108
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,384
We're gonna get these fuckers.

109
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,586
Not if you're looking
in the wrong direction.

110
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,392
Detective Quinn.

111
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,127
Not now. Really.

112
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:36,646
I didn't come here for a quote.

113
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,730
You all right?

114
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,432
My partner's been shot.

115
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,850
The last thing I am is all right.

116
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,853
I know this can't be easy,

117
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,306
but if you need anything,

118
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,109
I'm here for you.

119
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:50,810
Thanks, Christine.

120
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,996
That means a lot.

121
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,114
I got to...

122
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:59,002
- It's okay.
- All right.

123
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:00,086
Sergeant Batista.

124
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:01,004
No comment.

125
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:02,505
Come on, sergeant.

126
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,291
Is this the work of
the vacation murderers?

127
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:08,094
I said no...

128
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,433
On the record.

129
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:16,769
It's too early to tell,

130
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,771
but one of 'em, Johnny Rose,

131
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,840
we found out has syphilis,

132
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,809
and it's real bad. Untreatable.

133
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,394
Multiple partners.

134
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,512
Print that.

135
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,231
With pictures.

136
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,349
I call it in now,

137
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,318
it'll be online this morning

138
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,454
and on the stands this afternoon.

139
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,823
With pictures.

140
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,665
While my colleagues

141
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,250
are working the vacation murder theory,

142
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,135
I'm gonna follow Lundy's theory

143
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,171
and check his hotel room for clues.

144
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:54,424
Lundy devoted his life
to hunting Trinity.

145
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:55,925
He left word for me

146
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,710
he'd had an interesting encounter

147
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,480
two days ago.

148
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,765
You think it was Trinity?

149
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,235
Every crime scene is a jigsaw puzzle.

150
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:06,903
So many pieces.

151
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:08,521
Assemble them right,

152
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,323
A picture forms.

153
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,741
If it was Trinity,

154
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,444
It'd explain why Deb is
alive and Lundy isn't.

155
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,279
Trinity's a monster.

156
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,698
If he was the one who hurt your sister,

157
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,400
you need to kill him.

158
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,504
That was my blood down there too.

159
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:29,842
You can't let these be
logged into evidence.

160
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:32,078
Not until I have a complete picture.

161
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:44,641
Police so far are refusing to comment

162
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,809
on the murder of a former FBI agent

163
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,061
and the shooting of a Miami Metro

164
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,095
homicide detective.

165
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:50,563
But Channel Nine has learned

166
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:51,981
there may be a connection

167
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,566
to the so called vacation murders.

168
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,817
Sources tell us that...

169
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,987
All right. Denver
omelet, side of rye toast.

170
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,822
Can I top that off for ya?

171
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,274
Coffee's fine,

172
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:03,793
but there are no diced
tomatoes in my omelet.

173
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:05,278
I'm sorry about that.

174
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,779
Cook is slammed today.

175
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,299
I'll bring you a side of tomatoes.

176
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,633
How's that coffee?

177
00:09:10,668 --> 00:09:12,252
My coffee's not the issue.

178
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:15,471
My breakfast, on the other hand, is.

179
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:17,173
You need to start over.

180
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:22,461
Denver omelet... with tomatoes... diced.

181
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:26,465
Coming right up.

182
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,484
You're a dear. Thanks.

183
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:33,406
Astor, will you get that?

184
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,941
But it's Dexter's.

185
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,192
Oh, it's okay.

186
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,910
He was in such a hurry
he probably forgot it.

187
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:38,911
Could be the hospital.

188
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,646
Is aunt Deb gonna die?

189
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:43,833
Oh, no, honey. No, she's gonna be okay.

190
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:46,669
Some man. He says
he's Dexter's landlord.

191
00:09:46,704 --> 00:09:49,205
There's something wrong
with Dexter's apartment.

192
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,791
Oh, there's got to
be a misunderstanding.

193
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,877
Uh, yes, hi. This is Rita Morgan?

194
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,776
How long have you been there?

195
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,730
Not long.

196
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:14,947
You're sitting up.

197
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,532
It's a good sign.

198
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:19,319
I'm fine.

199
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:24,157
I didn't even need surgery.

200
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:27,794
Couple stitches.

201
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:31,214
Looks like more than a couple.

202
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:35,201
You have any pain?

203
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:40,256
No. Just tired.

204
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,392
Whatever they gave me has some kick.

205
00:10:42,426 --> 00:10:43,393
You want me to come back?

206
00:10:43,427 --> 00:10:48,381
It's okay. I'm fine.

207
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,100
You remember anything at all?

208
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:55,738
You see anything unusual?

209
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:57,390
It's all still a blur.

210
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:59,409
Who was hit first?

211
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:00,559
You, or-

212
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,894
Jesus, Dex.

213
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,780
Am I squeezing too tight?

214
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,564
I expect those kind of questions

215
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,833
From Batista or Quinn,

216
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:07,917
but not my brother.

217
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:10,169
You said you were fine.

218
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:12,338
Twice.

219
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:13,956
Doesn't matter, anyway.

220
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:18,261
Just tell me what you want me to do.

221
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:22,048
That's just it.

222
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,767
You can't do anything.

223
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:27,637
No one can.

224
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:33,726
I didn't feel anything.

225
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,361
I didn't even know I'd been hit

226
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:38,981
until I was on the ground.

227
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,984
And then two more shots.

228
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,793
So much blood.

229
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:53,329
You're safe.

230
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,047
I'm here.

231
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:59,669
Lundy had this look in his eyes.

232
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,308
Like he was apologizing.

233
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:09,462
I couldn't do anything.

234
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,181
I was helpless.

235
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,652
Fuck, I can't even walk

236
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:18,488
three feet to the bathroom.

237
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:20,156
Do you need to...

238
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,075
Yeah. Bad.

239
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,945
Come on.

240
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,537
Okay?

241
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:39,258
Mm-hmm.

242
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:42,178
I may not know who shot my sister,

243
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:45,515
or why her life was spared,

244
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:49,218
but I do know I won't
be returning the favor.

245
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,059
Oh, god. Deb, is she

246
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,198
Peeing.

247
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:05,351
I'll just-uh...

248
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,370
be outside.

249
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:11,690
Hey.

250
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,409
How's Deb?

251
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,912
She's lucky to be alive.

252
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,247
I was so worried.

253
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,865
Can I see her?

254
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,918
Uh, she's peeing.

255
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,888
With Anton.

256
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:27,540
I would have been here sooner,

257
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,208
but I got hung up on the phone.

258
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,426
Your landlord called.

259
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,895
A pipe burst in your kitchen...

260
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,214
at your apartment?

261
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,484
Oh.

262
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,053
I was just hanging on to the place

263
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,555
until the lease ran out.

264
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:45,024
So I could get the
security deposit back.

265
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,326
Why'd you tell me you got rid of it?

266
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:48,327
I said that?

267
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:52,415
Talk about this later.

268
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:53,699
This isn't the time or the place,

269
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:56,369
Not with Deb here.

270
00:13:56,403 --> 00:14:00,756
Family comes first.

271
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,593
I'm just so sorry I wasn't here.

272
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:06,379
You don't have to keep saying that.

273
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:09,849
So glad you're all right.

274
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,917
I'm not.

275
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,936
Babe, what is it?

276
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,810
I slept with Lundy.

277
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:33,272
I thought you were happy.

278
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,875
I thought I was too.

279
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,213
I can move out.

280
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,966
No. No. No.

281
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:46,052
Listen, I'll see you through this, okay?

282
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,053
You did the same for me.

283
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:51,557
Anton, stop.

284
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:55,595
You deserve so much better.

285
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:58,347
Is that what you want?

286
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,821
Sorry I hurt you.

287
00:15:21,371 --> 00:15:23,172
Anton?

288
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,965
<i>Gracias.</i>

289
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,967
Just hung up from
notifying Lundy's daughter.

290
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,135
Then you could really use

291
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:39,555
a shot of whiskey in there.

292
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,526
I get that the guy's
personally invested in this,

293
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,844
But Matthews hovering
around like a vulture

294
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,480
isn't gonna help us catch bad guys.

295
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:51,450
Angel...

296
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:53,185
I made official disclosure yesterday

297
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:57,740
that we're seeing each other.

298
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,208
We talked about this.

299
00:15:59,242 --> 00:16:02,461
I know.

300
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:04,363
But it was the right thing to do.

301
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,833
I said I was uncomfortable
with the disclosure stuff,

302
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,135
and you go ahead and do it anyway?

303
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,087
I made a judgment call.

304
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:15,341
The problem, Maria,

305
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,894
is that you made it for the both of us.

306
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:22,565
You shouldn't keep the
deputy chief waiting.

307
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:36,395
What do we got?

308
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,747
Not much.

309
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:39,081
No witnesses, no security cameras.

310
00:16:39,116 --> 00:16:40,116
Took a statement from Deb,

311
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,567
she can't remember seeing anything.

312
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:42,785
Forensics.

313
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,587
Waiting on trace and
ballistics from the lab.

314
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:46,756
APBs out on Rose and Wald.

315
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,424
County's increased
patrols at the airport

316
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,009
and the higher profile tourist hotels.

317
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,510
If my face was all over the media

318
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:53,579
for shooting a cop and a fed,

319
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:54,930
I'd be digging a fucking hole

320
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:57,216
all the way to China.

321
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,934
No one fuckin' go there.

322
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:00,519
Or you'd be watching the press

323
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:02,221
to try and stay one step ahead of us.

324
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,355
It's a Hail Mary,

325
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,440
But I planted a story

326
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:05,775
with Quinn's girlfriend.

327
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:07,143
She's not-
We're not-

328
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,894
You're the paper's unnamed online source

329
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:09,895
about Johnny boy's drip?

330
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,815
I figure if Johnny has syphilis

331
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,700
and Nikki wasn't listed by the county

332
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:16,318
as one of his sexual partners...

333
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,536
She may not know.

334
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:20,823
Exactly.

335
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:24,126
Maybe we turn these
two against each other.

336
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,497
Rita was right.

337
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,249
Family does come first.

338
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:33,886
Finding who did this to
my sister comes first.

339
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,138
Is this a new page of the code?

340
00:17:36,173 --> 00:17:39,141
Revenge?

341
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,513
My sanctuary.

342
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,233
It's private and... sacred no more.

343
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,944
If I have to give up this place,

344
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:01,831
What will I do about my roommate,

345
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:04,617
the dark passenger?

346
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,418
This apartment is the only thing

347
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:09,455
that's helped me keep the mask in place.

348
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,040
Without it...

349
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,291
I'll burst.

350
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,099
They're letting me out tomorrow.

351
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:21,717
That's great.

352
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,886
Any chance you can give me a ride?

353
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,187
Of course.

354
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:28,190
I'm also kind of gonna
need a place to stay.

355
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:29,558
I broke up with Anton,

356
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,277
and, no, I don't want to talk about it.

357
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,646
We can make room for you.

358
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,514
Rita won't mind?

359
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,484
Don't worry, Deb. I'll
take care of everything.

360
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:46,075
Trinity's a lone wolf.

361
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,693
Unable to connect.

362
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:49,361
Except with his victims.

363
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,081
He never deviates.

364
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,968
Bleeds out a young female in a bathtub,

365
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:59,338
forces a woman to jump to her death,

366
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,724
and five days later

367
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:03,893
bludgeons an older male.

368
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:06,812
I'll look at potential sites.

369
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:10,182
This may be the closest
to Trinity I've ever been.

370
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:13,352
Lundy got closer than he thought.

371
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:16,655
He just couldn't see how
all the pieces interlock,

372
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,442
what they form.

373
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:28,233
A sacred ritual.

374
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:31,570
If there's anyone who knows
the importance of ritual,

375
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,205
it's you.

376
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,707
Lundy underestimated

377
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,091
how far Trinity would go

378
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:37,626
to make sure his ritual

379
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,128
wasn't interrupted.

380
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,380
Lundy was an obstacle.

381
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,299
And Trinity killed him.

382
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:48,137
If anyone has ever deserved
to be on your table,

383
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,556
it's this son of a bitch.

384
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:05,955
Can I help you?

385
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:07,957
I'm taking on a project.

386
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:09,608
How big?

387
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,244
Almost more than I can handle.

388
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,046
And I don't have a lot of time.

389
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,464
Maybe you need another hand or two.

390
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:16,999
There's plenty of laborers out there.

391
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,953
No, no. I work alone.

392
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:23,505
Sounds like you need the
right tool for the job.

393
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,558
So much work.

394
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:29,011
But I have to finish
what I started, right?

395
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,180
Yeah, I-I guess.

396
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,685
What would you do?

397
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:37,770
Me?

398
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,739
Oh, I'd go with the framing hammer.

399
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:42,408
Got a lot of heft.

400
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,026
It's versatile.

401
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:48,781
You can't go wrong.

402
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,699
I see what you mean.

403
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,339
You've been very helpful.

404
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:25,367
Lobby's open 24 hours.

405
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:27,486
12-story building, hundreds of rooms.

406
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,871
Trinity could strike anywhere.

407
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:31,991
He'll have to set up shop
in the surveillance room.

408
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:34,076
Trinity's the perfect predator - 

409
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,996
camouflaged, waiting for
his victim to be alone,

410
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,864
and then he strikes.

411
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:42,084
Trinity struck here 30 years ago.

412
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:45,037
A bartender, father of two,

413
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,972
was found bludgeoned to death

414
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:48,340
in the men's room of a tavern

415
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,175
at this same address.

416
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,511
If history is going to repeat itself,

417
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:56,648
this is where Trinity will be.

418
00:21:56,683 --> 00:22:00,602
Problem is, you have no
idea who you're looking for.

419
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,187
Lundy was so methodical,

420
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,723
He would have commented on
Trinity's physical appearance

421
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,608
if their paths had ever crossed,

422
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,727
but there's nothing in his tapes.

423
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,946
I've listened to them all.

424
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,531
You sure about that?

425
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:13,832
<i>That's your recorder.</i>

426
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:17,369
Where's Lundy's?

427
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,204
It wasn't in the hotel,

428
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:22,541
because Lundy had it on him.

429
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:25,260
Must have been logged
into evidence. Shit.

430
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:26,462
Dexter, you need that tape.

431
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:27,963
You need to be certain

432
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,214
it's Trinity on your table.

433
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:30,599
There's still time.

434
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,634
He won't complete the
cycle until tomorrow night.

435
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,470
And I'll be here.

436
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:37,306
Waiting.

437
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,558
Oh, god!

438
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:43,095
Oh!

439
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,129
That was, uh...

440
00:23:00,163 --> 00:23:01,830
unexpected.

441
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:05,300
That's not an adjective I usually hear.

442
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:08,220
I'm not complaining.

443
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,672
I'm just-

444
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,342
I'm just wondering
why you're really here.

445
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:16,061
My way of saying I appreciate
you running that story

446
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:17,062
for my boss.

447
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:18,897
Okay. Hmm.

448
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:20,849
You fucked me to thank me?

449
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,151
Technically, I went down on you

450
00:23:22,185 --> 00:23:23,152
to thank you.

451
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:32,578
I thought you said this
was just too complicated,

452
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:36,648
you being a cop and me being a reporter.

453
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,034
I guess I like complicated.

454
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:45,541
Look who's here.

455
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,009
Sorry, Astor.

456
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:49,327
I promise it won't be for long.

457
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,712
It's okay. I get Cody's room.

458
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,881
Sorry, Cody.

459
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,268
Come on, guys. It's
time to go to school.

460
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,170
Check in later.

461
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,864
Everything all right
between you and my brother?

462
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:11,683
We just need to have a talk.

463
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,952
It isn't about me staying here, is it?

464
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:16,622
No, you're family. You're
always welcome here.

465
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,690
I'm gonna let you get settled in,

466
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,292
And I'm gonna get you some water

467
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:23,078
for these pain pills, okay?

468
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,384
Rita.

469
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:31,136
Thank you.

470
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:16,798
Thanks for letting Deb stay with us.

471
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,752
It was either here or your apartment.

472
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,521
Look, we can't keep putting this off.

473
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:23,972
It's still not a good time.

474
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,057
I need to get to the station.

475
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:26,191
So when do you suppose

476
00:25:26,226 --> 00:25:27,425
it'll be a good time

477
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,928
to discuss why you lied to me?

478
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:32,064
I'm really trying here, Dexter.

479
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:33,949
Dexter.

480
00:25:33,983 --> 00:25:36,652
I'm just asking for a
little patience, all right?

481
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,203
Not for me, but for Deb.

482
00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:40,372
Right now I need to focus
on finding who did this.

483
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:45,744
Okay.

484
00:25:55,672 --> 00:25:57,389
You didn't come over last night.

485
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:59,791
So little time to sleep lately.

486
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:02,678
I thought I'd get more
rest in my own bed.

487
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:06,515
I'm sorry I went behind
your back to Matthews.

488
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:11,937
It was wrong, and I apologize.

489
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:13,438
If you haven't noticed,

490
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:15,524
I'm a bit of a control freak.

491
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,492
You mean like how like to
guard the remote control

492
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:18,810
with your life?

493
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,979
Or how you need to be the
first one in the shower.

494
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,080
Or how you like to-

495
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:25,150
Look, the reason I went to the brass

496
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:26,585
was because it'd be

497
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,787
one less thing to worry
about ruining what we have.

498
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:31,790
The only thing that
would ruin what we have

499
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:34,176
is if we're not honest with each other.

500
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,712
No more secrets.

501
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,797
No more secrets.

502
00:26:42,385 --> 00:26:46,671
Then I'm not going anywhere.

503
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,223
That's everything collected

504
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:49,524
from the parking lot and the hotel rooms

505
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,143
back there on the right.

506
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:53,145
Thanks for doing this.

507
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,113
My father gave Deb the ring,

508
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:56,782
and it means the world to her.

509
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:57,866
I checked the inventories.

510
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,517
Masuka never logged it in.

511
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:02,788
Yeah, Deb doesn't remember
if she was wearing it or not.

512
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:05,907
The shooting has her pretty messed up.

513
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,026
If my coming down here to double check

514
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:09,027
helps ease her mind,

515
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,028
so be it, right?

516
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:14,249
Yep.

517
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,034
Ah, fuck.

518
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,869
Damn it.

519
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,471
You Morgans and that mouth.

520
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:20,839
Do you mind?

521
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,057
Oh, yeah. Don't sweat it.

522
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:23,759
There's plenty more
where those come from.

523
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,811
Thanks.

524
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,500
Here you go.

525
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:51,586
Guess who just found her ring.

526
00:27:51,621 --> 00:27:53,038
Sorry for the trouble.

527
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:54,039
Thanks a lot, though.

528
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:57,209
No problem.

529
00:27:57,243 --> 00:27:59,010
I appreciate the personal tour.

530
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:00,462
Any time I can do rounds

531
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,764
with a fellow human being is a win.

532
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,016
You're alone every night?

533
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,085
Yeah, economy's a bitch.

534
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,438
There used to be two of
us on every shift, but now-

535
00:28:09,472 --> 00:28:10,605
Oh, say no more.

536
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,358
I'm recently laid off myself.

537
00:28:13,393 --> 00:28:16,528
From here on out I'm
gonna be my own boss.

538
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:18,897
Well, there's plenty
of office space here.

539
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:20,782
You know, more tenants means more money.

540
00:28:20,817 --> 00:28:22,734
Then maybe I won't have
to do these double shifts

541
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,569
and I can see my kids once in a while.

542
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:26,288
Oh, you end up setting up shop here,

543
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:28,940
I guarantee this'll be
your favorite destination

544
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,459
come lunch time.

545
00:28:30,493 --> 00:28:31,460
Right on schedule.

546
00:28:31,494 --> 00:28:32,794
And you brought me a customer.

547
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:34,612
It's a future renter.

548
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,332
Well, possible future renter.

549
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,000
Can I get you any?

550
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,385
No, no.

551
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,171
Caffeine makes me a different person.

552
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,808
Appreciate the offer, though.

553
00:28:46,843 --> 00:28:48,393
So you say you walk this whole place

554
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:50,061
every two hours?

555
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,847
That's quite a workout.

556
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:54,132
My wife calls it low-impact aerobics

557
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,818
or some shit like that.

558
00:28:56,853 --> 00:28:59,070
It takes about 45 minutes,

559
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:00,989
give or take a smoke break.

560
00:29:01,023 --> 00:29:05,494
Well, we all have our vices.

561
00:29:05,528 --> 00:29:07,529
So how'd you like the building?

562
00:29:10,032 --> 00:29:11,116
It's perfect.

563
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,617
Great.

564
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:13,618
Thanks a lot.

565
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,537
Mm-hmm.

566
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:27,215
Rita, I think something's
wrong with Harrison.

567
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,519
I know that cry.

568
00:29:30,553 --> 00:29:33,355
Someone's wet, isn't he?

569
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:34,773
Good.

570
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:35,774
Thought it was me.

571
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,359
Oh, no.

572
00:29:37,393 --> 00:29:40,562
No, Harrison loves his aunt Deb.

573
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:52,624
Can I ask you something?

574
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,409
I don't do diapers.

575
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,747
Did Dexter tell you
he kept his apartment?

576
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:01,466
What the fuck?

577
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:04,920
Are you kidding?

578
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,638
He told me he got rid of it.

579
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:09,591
Me too.

580
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:12,594
Just thought he might
have said something

581
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,647
since you two are so close.

582
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:17,098
Not a word.

583
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:26,575
God, it's like a Morgan
family curse or something-

584
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:29,227
Make the worst choice possible.

585
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:37,953
At least Dexter's
don't get people killed.

586
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:41,423
You think you're responsible
for Lundy's death?

587
00:30:41,457 --> 00:30:43,741
He never would have been
anywhere near that parking lot

588
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,594
if it weren't for me.

589
00:30:45,628 --> 00:30:48,380
Is that why your pain
pills are in the trash?

590
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:51,266
Punish yourself?

591
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,052
What happened to Lundy isn't your fault.

592
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:57,138
You had no control over it.

593
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,225
This isn't about choices

594
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:02,777
or even about you.

595
00:31:02,812 --> 00:31:05,146
Sometimes bad things just happen.

596
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:16,074
That's the answer to this?

597
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:18,326
Bad things happen?

598
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,278
Life happens.

599
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:25,800
I've yet to find Trinity's signature

600
00:31:25,835 --> 00:31:27,836
at any of his crime scenes.

601
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,424
Trinity moves from state to state.

602
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,676
Law enforcement never
links his kill cycles

603
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:37,846
to one another.

604
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:40,398
Over 30 years of killing.

605
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:42,567
The cycle, the ritual,

606
00:31:42,602 --> 00:31:44,686
they tell me where Trinity will be,

607
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,988
But I have to know who I'm looking for.

608
00:31:47,023 --> 00:31:48,490
I have to be sure.

609
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:51,526
Lobby's open 24 hours.

610
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:52,661
Guard on duty.

611
00:31:52,695 --> 00:31:53,778
Too much foot traffic.

612
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,580
Trinity'd have to choose another floor.

613
00:31:55,615 --> 00:31:58,199
Ooh. Sorry.

614
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,819
Bus number 432.

615
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,204
Male.

616
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,589
Maybe 6'4".

617
00:32:04,624 --> 00:32:07,175
190 to 200 pounds.

618
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:08,960
Age around 60.

619
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:13,665
Hair gray, eyes blue.

620
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:15,850
Something in them.

621
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:18,470
Lundy saw a ghost.

622
00:32:22,892 --> 00:32:24,225
Okay, listen up, everyone.

623
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,778
I just got word there
was a shooting at a motel.

624
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:28,780
You all need to get there
as soon as possible, guys.

625
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:30,031
So Quinn's already en route.

626
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:31,650
Angel, you're with me.

627
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,785
Masuka, grab your stuff.

628
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:35,353
What's going on?

629
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:36,688
Motel shooting.

630
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:38,239
Body's a match for Johnny Rose.

631
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,324
I'm going with you.

632
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:40,325
You can't work this.

633
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,326
You're next of kin.

634
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,378
I've got it.

635
00:32:43,412 --> 00:32:44,829
Let's just hope Deb

636
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:46,414
is finally gonna get some justice.

637
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,384
That's the plan.

638
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,423
Karma.

639
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:58,042
What a fuckin' concept.

640
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:02,731
<i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>

641
00:33:02,765 --> 00:33:05,984
The first bullet didn't
quite make her point.

642
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:07,402
Lieutenant, we've got Nikki Wald

643
00:33:07,436 --> 00:33:09,104
cornered in the alley
behind Al's liquor store.

644
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:12,357
Let's go.

645
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:14,058
Prick.

646
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:16,578
Son of a bitch. God.

647
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:26,955
What do we got?

648
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:27,956
Found her in the alley.

649
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:29,591
Altered, agitated.

650
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,909
Every time we get near the gun goes up.

651
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,411
- We good?
- Yeah.

652
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:37,182
Why? Why?

653
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:40,602
Nikki!

654
00:33:40,636 --> 00:33:41,886
Damn it.

655
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,688
He fuckin'-

656
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:45,640
He fuckin' cheated on me.

657
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:49,527
We need you to put the gun down.

658
00:33:49,562 --> 00:33:50,528
He ruined everything.

659
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:53,531
You fuckin' ruined everything.

660
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:55,400
She's wasted.

661
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:56,701
She doesn't even know where she is.

662
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:00,538
Cover us.

663
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:02,741
Nikki.

664
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:03,742
No one's gonna hurt you.

665
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:05,276
We just want to talk.

666
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,277
The alley's sealed off.

667
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:07,612
You can't go anywhere.

668
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,781
Did you hear that, Johnny?

669
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:10,782
What about the boat?

670
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,883
What about Bermuda, Johnny?

671
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:12,884
Wasn't that the plan?

672
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:15,086
You piece of shit!

673
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,921
Aah!

674
00:34:20,176 --> 00:34:21,142
We got 'em, Morgan.

675
00:34:21,177 --> 00:34:22,427
Got who?

676
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:24,145
Nikki Walden, Johnny
Rose. Well, we got Nikki.

677
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,396
Johnny's on his way to the morgue.

678
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:26,464
What happened?

679
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:28,683
She fuckin' shot him. Long story.

680
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,602
Look, I know this doesn't
change what happened,

681
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:31,986
but hopefully you'll
find some peace of mind

682
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:33,805
knowing this thing's over.

683
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:35,106
Yeah.

684
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,825
Peace of mind.

685
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:38,643
I got to take this
skank down to booking.

686
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:41,412
Congratulations, partner.

687
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:47,836
Such a waste.

688
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,788
Lundy, those other tourists.

689
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:52,090
For what? A boat to Bermuda?

690
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:54,992
Hell hath no fury like
a meth addict scorned.

691
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,212
Your office, lieutenant.

692
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:59,798
Was-Was that a smile?

693
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:01,165
I don't know.

694
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:08,890
Congratulations, Maria.

695
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,675
That was really good
police work out there today.

696
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:12,477
Thanks.

697
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:16,364
But it was sergeant
Batista's good police work.

698
00:35:16,398 --> 00:35:17,565
Yes.

699
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:22,537
Well, I know he's an asset to your team,

700
00:35:22,571 --> 00:35:23,872
but this department can't risk

701
00:35:23,906 --> 00:35:25,990
a defense attorney turning
your romantic involvement

702
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:26,991
into a courtroom sideshow

703
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:28,376
every time you work a case together.

704
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,911
What are you saying?

705
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:32,547
I am saying I need you to
transfer sergeant Batista

706
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:34,031
out of homicide.

707
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:38,219
Tom, this is bullshit.

708
00:35:38,254 --> 00:35:40,221
We followed protocol.

709
00:35:40,256 --> 00:35:41,923
Christ, he made this bust.

710
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:43,341
Which is why I'm going to make sure

711
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,893
That sergeant Batista gets a promotion

712
00:35:44,927 --> 00:35:49,397
along with his transfer.

713
00:35:49,431 --> 00:35:52,934
Have the papers on my desk by Monday.

714
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,652
Sergeant.

715
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:02,026
Fuck. What is it?

716
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,198
While everyone's chasing
their tails over Nikki Wald,

717
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:09,500
I'm going after the man
who really shot my sister.

718
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:12,236
In a few hours, the
enigma that is Trinity

719
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:13,905
will be on my table.

720
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:15,924
A riddle wrapped in plastic.

721
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:19,761
Morgan.

722
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:21,212
I need to see you.

723
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:23,431
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

724
00:36:23,465 --> 00:36:24,432
Can it wait?

725
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:25,967
No.

726
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:28,419
Well, I'm way over on
the other side of town.

727
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:30,254
It'll take me at least
an hour to get there.

728
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,473
I'm not home.

729
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,943
I'm where Frank was shot.

730
00:36:45,938 --> 00:36:48,239
You can't even see our blood.

731
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:53,444
It's like it never happened.

732
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:55,112
Deb?

733
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,799
What the fuck's your problem?

734
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,450
I got here as fast as I could.

735
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:01,219
You have everything,

736
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:02,553
And you're doing your goddamn best

737
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:04,956
to throw it all away.

738
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,595
Rita told you about the apartment?

739
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:12,730
What the fuck were you thinking?

740
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:14,565
You have to make this right.

741
00:37:19,772 --> 00:37:21,072
I'm not sure I know how.

742
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:23,908
You figure it out.

743
00:37:23,943 --> 00:37:26,577
I'm the fuck-up in the family. Not you.

744
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:28,079
Don't say that.

745
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:30,164
You have a choice.

746
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:32,367
To be a good husband.

747
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:33,918
To be a good father.

748
00:37:33,953 --> 00:37:36,254
I know.

749
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:38,790
It's just, uh...

750
00:37:42,044 --> 00:37:46,264
Sometimes I feel trapped.

751
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:49,133
By what?

752
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,519
Three kids?

753
00:37:51,553 --> 00:37:54,338
A wife who adores you?

754
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:59,227
Yesterday, I had Lundy and Anton.

755
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,732
And now they're gone because of me.

756
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,818
You didn't do anything wrong.

757
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:15,192
It doesn't matter what I do.

758
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,079
Or what I choose.

759
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:22,550
I'm what's wrong.

760
00:38:22,584 --> 00:38:25,386
There's nothing I can do about it.

761
00:38:25,421 --> 00:38:28,389
If I'm not hurting myself,

762
00:38:28,424 --> 00:38:30,008
I'm hurting everyone around me.

763
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:32,593
There's nothing I can do about it.

764
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,713
I'm-I'm broken.

765
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:36,931
I'm-

766
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:42,520
No, you're not.

767
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,822
I am.

768
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:56,918
Why don't we go back to the house?

769
00:38:56,952 --> 00:39:00,872
Don't! Don't.

770
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:04,842
I need to be here.

771
00:39:04,877 --> 00:39:08,513
Where Lundy died.

772
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:12,433
I can't do a fucking thing about it.

773
00:39:26,315 --> 00:39:30,818
My sister doesn't deserve
to be in this kind of pain.

774
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:35,456
But I know who does.

775
00:39:35,491 --> 00:39:36,991
Trinity hurt my sister,

776
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,793
and I'm going to hurt him back,

777
00:39:38,827 --> 00:39:44,215
And it's going to feel-
-uh-oh.

778
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:46,217
Your manager let me in.

779
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:50,304
He had no idea we were married.

780
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:54,559
Funny thing is, I'm
getting to wonder myself.

781
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:57,095
Rita, you're upset.

782
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:59,797
I actually convinced myself

783
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:00,848
that by coming here

784
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,650
this would all make sense...

785
00:40:02,684 --> 00:40:05,103
Why it was so important

786
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:06,487
that you keep this place a secret.

787
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:14,412
As I was coming over here,

788
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:15,646
all I could think about-

789
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:18,315
that you were using drugs again.

790
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,152
That you were having an affair again.

791
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,420
That will never happen.

792
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:24,422
I went through your cabinets,

793
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:28,342
rifled through your desk,

794
00:40:28,377 --> 00:40:29,961
looking for anything

795
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:31,929
that would explain

796
00:40:31,964 --> 00:40:34,182
what would be so horrible

797
00:40:34,216 --> 00:40:36,434
that my husband would
have to keep a place

798
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:38,052
to hide it from me

799
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:39,687
or his own sister.

800
00:40:39,721 --> 00:40:41,839
And?

801
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:43,191
I was gonna break the lock,

802
00:40:43,225 --> 00:40:46,227
but I was too scared
of what I might find.

803
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,729
And you know why?

804
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,899
'Cause you put me in
this position, Dexter.

805
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,236
This is not the type of person
or wife that I want to be.

806
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:06,581
You really want to know what's inside?

807
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,416
Yes.

808
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:30,438
It was Harry's.

809
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,828
I wasn't comfortable having
it in the house with the kids,

810
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:43,251
so I kept it here.

811
00:41:43,285 --> 00:41:45,336
See?

812
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,955
I have nothing to hide.

813
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,341
Except for the syringes,
scalpels, and bone saw

814
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:53,094
hidden in that secret drawer underneath.

815
00:41:53,128 --> 00:41:55,213
Nothing to hide.

816
00:41:55,247 --> 00:41:56,714
Like your car accident

817
00:41:56,748 --> 00:42:00,017
and your concussion and this apartment?

818
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:01,686
The most disturbing thing

819
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,690
about your lying is that...

820
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:07,091
I'm beginning to see

821
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:10,594
just how good you really are at it.

822
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,780
You should sleep here tonight.

823
00:42:12,814 --> 00:42:14,315
When you're ready to come home,

824
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:15,866
we have a lot of work to do

825
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:18,069
if this marriage has any hope.

826
00:42:34,503 --> 00:42:36,387
Hey. Pulling an all-nighter?

827
00:42:36,421 --> 00:42:37,555
Yep. No rest for the wicked.

828
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:38,556
Have a good one.

829
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,624
Always do.

830
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:55,823
It's almost poetic-

831
00:42:55,857 --> 00:42:57,241
One serial killer

832
00:42:57,276 --> 00:42:59,443
ending the 30-year reign of another.

833
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:01,662
Trinity could be
anywhere in this building.

834
00:43:01,697 --> 00:43:02,663
I've got to get

835
00:43:02,698 --> 00:43:04,582
to the security surveillance room.

836
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:09,503
Huh. Where's that security guard?

837
00:43:09,538 --> 00:43:11,088
He was here last night.

838
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,551
I've been so focused on Trinity,

839
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:25,553
I've neglected who his victim might be.

840
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:27,671
The bludgeoning victim 30 years ago,

841
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:30,674
didn't he have two kids?

842
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:32,226
It's the security guard.

843
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,127
If he's here...

844
00:43:50,162 --> 00:43:52,380
then where's Trinity?

845
00:43:52,414 --> 00:43:56,700
Aah!

846
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,568
Take the bait.

847
00:44:14,603 --> 00:44:17,221
Take the bait.

848
00:44:23,612 --> 00:44:25,079
Oh, no.

849
00:44:25,113 --> 00:44:26,730
Please.

850
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:30,451
I'm a father!

851
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:35,122
You were no father.

852
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,624
Aah!

853
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:40,344
You made me...

854
00:44:40,379 --> 00:44:41,679
You made me...

855
00:44:44,716 --> 00:44:46,583
The recording disc is gone.

856
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:51,305
Where are you, Trinity?

857
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,400
Oh, my god.

858
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:04,601
You made me do this.

859
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:14,278
Trinity.

860
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:32,680
Shit.

861
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:41,272
The elevators aren't moving.

862
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:44,658
He's using the stairs.

863
00:45:44,693 --> 00:45:46,744
Which one?

864
00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:48,279
I can't risk picking the wrong exit

865
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:49,480
and miss Trinity.

866
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:51,115
His car has to be here.

867
00:46:28,487 --> 00:46:31,572
No way I lose you again, Trinity.

868
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:38,195
In Miami, nobody sees.

869
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:39,747
He's scurrying back

870
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:43,217
to whatever hole he crawled out of.

871
00:46:43,251 --> 00:46:46,303
The lone wolf thinks this is over.

872
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:56,597
Asshole!

873
00:46:56,648 --> 00:47:01,485
What the hell's he doing?

874
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,321
Where are you going, Trinity?

875
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,327
Stay with him.

876
00:47:10,362 --> 00:47:13,497
He's not getting away.

877
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:22,289
He doesn't belong here.
It doesn't make sense.

878
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,941
Hi, honey.

879
00:47:40,976 --> 00:47:45,596
Mmm. Missed you.

880
00:47:45,614 --> 00:47:47,648
Hey, kids.

881
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:49,984
Daddy.

882
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:51,602
Hey, dad.

883
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,270
Lundy was wrong.

884
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:54,572
I was wrong.

885
00:47:54,606 --> 00:47:55,873
Neither of us

886
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:58,442
knew pieces of the puzzle were missing.

887
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,160
Trinity's a husband,

888
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:04,582
a father.

889
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:06,216
He's...

890
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:08,619
like me.
