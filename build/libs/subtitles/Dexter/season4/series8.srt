1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,961
Previously on Dexter.

2
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:07,090
You need to kill it.

3
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:08,466
No, I-I can't.

4
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:11,219
(Harry) What's the real reason
you're stalling on killing Trinity?

5
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,596
(Dexter) I still have things
to learn from him.

6
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,140
Judging from the spray,
we're looking at somebody tall,

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,725
over six feet.

8
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,686
(Dexter) He moved the arm...

9
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,312
for a reason.

10
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,815
(Masuka) That smudge you found
at the crime scene?

11
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,234
Cremated human remains.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,902
We got the killer's goddamn DNA?

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,446
The killer is related
to the human remains.

14
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,281
Same family. The same DNA.

15
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:35,118
He keeps his family
with him all the time.

16
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,369
Vera Mitchell.

17
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,871
Sister of Arthur Mitchell.

18
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,248
Found dead in a...

19
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,290
Bathtub.

20
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,960
This is Arthur Mitchell at his core.

21
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:47,004
Is there something in his DNA
that lets him keep a family,

22
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,340
some magic gene I'm missing?

23
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,259
I just got the official
go-ahead from LaGuerta

24
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,302
to open a Trinity Killer investigation.

25
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,637
What's that mean?

26
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,432
I realized if I pitched
the entire Trinity theory

27
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,684
and I added that he also
shot me and Lundy,

28
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,893
look like a fucking lunatic,

29
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,187
so I boiled it down
to the bludgeonings.

30
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,732
I am no longer seeing
Lieutenant LaGuerta.

31
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,525
We broke up, officially.

32
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,486
If I find out this is bullshit,
there will be consequences -

33
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,489
severe, career-ending
consequences.

34
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,866
Who are you?

35
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,909
I'm the person
who's going to keep you

36
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,578
from killing any more women.

37
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,163
I didn't fucking kill them!

38
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,874
Because of my pictures,
those women will live on forever!

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,293
- Nothing lasts forever.
- (Screams)

40
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,504
- Isn't that...
- Farrow's assistant.

41
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,840
I just arrested him for
the murder of Estrella Carazo.

42
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,467
But, no, I thought...

43
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,677
Yeah, at first it looked like Farrow,
but this is airtight.

44
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,305
We got DNA evidence.
We got everything.

45
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,724
I killed an innocent man.

46
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,346
So I made a mistake.
It could've happened to anyone -

47
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,682
well, any murderer -

48
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,434
not that murderers typically care

49
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,145
whether their victims
are innocent or not.

50
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,522
But why is it eating at me?

51
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:59,155
Jonathan Farrow - S&M photographer,

52
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,198
abuser of women,

53
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,367
asshole, but not a killer -

54
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,828
not up to Harry's code.

55
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,246
Yet I killed him.

56
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,165
Now I'm...

57
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,293
uncomfortable.

58
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,923
It should've been
Arthur Mitchell on my table.

59
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,507
(Sighs)

60
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,760
Trinity, shooter of my sister.

61
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,553
I should've...

62
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,099
No, no "should'ves."
I don't do "should'ves." That's not me.

63
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:31,687
(Whispers) This isn't me.

64
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,481
Aah, shit.

65
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,192
I just need to stop thinking about it.

66
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,944
Jonathon Farrow...

67
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,238
originally a suspect,
now possibly a victim.

68
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,366
It was a mistake, for fuck's sake.

69
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,826
Farrow disappeared
right before his assistant,

70
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:49,038
Timothy Brand, confessed
to murdering those models.

71
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,540
Missing persons
has been investigating,

72
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,042
and now they're passing it on to us.

73
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,710
You think Brand killed Farrow?

74
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,546
Maybe he found out what Brand
was up to, it's hard to say.

75
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:00,174
Soderquist, Yale, stay with Farrow.

76
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,259
Brand probably
turned him into gator bait.

77
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,844
I wish I could take comfort

78
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,055
that my crime
has been pinned on Brand.

79
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,015
But I can't.

80
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,267
What is wrong with you?

81
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:11,644
(Sighing) I don't know.

82
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,231
OK, moving on. Morgan...
what do we have on your bludgeonings?

83
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,566
Maybe this'll cheer you up.

84
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,653
Not if you're making headway on Trinity.

85
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,326
We've got a serial bludgeoner.

86
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,870
The victims are all men in their 40s.

87
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,580
I've got cases
dating back 30 years,

88
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:35,418
which most likely puts
our bludgeoner in his 50s or 60s.

89
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,837
The break in the case
came with the discovery

90
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,880
of the human ash
he left behind,

91
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,966
along with his own saliva -

92
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,300
read DNA.

93
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,720
You're welcome.
Just doing my job.

94
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,931
The killer leaves the ash
as his sick-ass signature,

95
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,892
making his vics point at it postmortem.

96
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,228
I can't be sure
all of these are ash marks,

97
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,064
but the finger-pointing indicates
a strong possibility that...

98
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,567
Ahh, how'd that get in there?

99
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,654
No, whoa. Could you go back?

100
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,574
Go back.

101
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,994
This isn't a bludgeoning.

102
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,704
No.

103
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,292
Yet the victim's finger seems
to be pointing towards a smudge.

104
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,918
Ash?

105
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:19,837
Don't do it, Deb.

106
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,881
Uh...

107
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,341
Yeah, probably.

108
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:30,014
When you presented this case to me,
you said it was limited to a bludgeoner.

109
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,644
So how about we hear all of it,
Detective Morgan?

110
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,646
It's gonna sound insane...

111
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,440
I hope.

112
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:44,028
All right.
I found possible smudges

113
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,239
in several old bathtub killings.

114
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,951
Also several jumper suicides.

115
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,745
And that's the pattern -

116
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,164
bathtub, jumper, bludgeon -

117
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,458
all in close succession.

118
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:01,003
One cycle of three vics
every year or so,

119
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,838
possibly for 30 years.

120
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,882
Different cities, different states.

121
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:08,135
It's a...a trinity of victims...

122
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,639
which is why Frank Lundy
called him the Trinity Killer.

123
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,308
- This is an FBI case?
- The FBI never bought it.

124
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,726
Yet we're supposed to.

125
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,813
Lundy came to Miami
to hunt this guy.

126
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,318
I think he got too close,
and I think it got him killed and me shot.

127
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:30,407
So this Trinity Killer
did that to you?

128
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:33,744
Come on, LaGuerta,
say it's far-fetched.

129
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,207
Go on.

130
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,168
Great, like I need you people
getting in my way.

131
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,338
Well, Trinity is past his due date.
This just confirms it.

132
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,007
Dex. Can you believe it?

133
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,261
- Yeah, you really did it.
- I kept Lundy's legacy alive.

134
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,762
I even got the bosses on board.

135
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,682
Detective Morgan, my office.

136
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,559
Is that a commendation I smell?

137
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,018
Go get 'em, tiger.

138
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,562
Ess.

139
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,188
Tigress.

140
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,903
Dex. Hey, buddy.

141
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,156
Keep walking. Not in the mood.

142
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,740
Halftime?

143
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,368
It's called lunch, buddy.

144
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,245
Off campus, as usual.

145
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,289
(Elevator bell dings)

146
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,167
I really do need to stab something.

147
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,094
The Trinity Killer.

148
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,140
This is good.

149
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,809
There's no question of his guilt,

150
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,312
and I could use some certainty.

151
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,773
Hey, Jonah,
how those wheels holding up?

152
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,524
Like a dream, Mr. Butler.

153
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,318
Like a real nice dream.

154
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,153
Kyle!

155
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:36,158
Hey. What brings you here
this fine day?

156
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,952
Ah, just checking in.

157
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,204
You know, after the...

158
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,498
..deer.
Wanted to make sure you're OK.

159
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,793
Oh, that's kind of you,
but I've put it out of my mind,

160
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,254
no need to dwell.

161
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,880
You can just do that?

162
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,676
No, no, no.
Smooth, circular motion, son,

163
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,262
- and the paint job will last for years.
- I got it, Dad.

164
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,305
If you've got it,
I wouldn't have to remind you.

165
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,058
There are two ways to do things.
Why not choose the right way?

166
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,686
Small cracks in the perfect family,

167
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,355
which makes them perfectly normal.

168
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,482
(Door opens)

169
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,652
- Kyle, hello.
- Hey.

170
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,489
Honey, your clothes are clean,
folded, and ready to be packed.

171
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,658
Going out of town?

172
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,493
- Yeah, Tampa.
- Oh.

173
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,703
A Four Walls build.

174
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,956
An out-of-town build - is his cycle
starting over again already?

175
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,416
- Rebecca.
- Mm-hm?

176
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,210
The ground needs
to be really soaked.

177
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,713
A good soaking, or all these
flowers are just gonna die.

178
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,298
OK, sorry.

179
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,260
So, Tampa -
the whole family going?

180
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,053
No, not on out-of-towners.

181
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,930
It's too expensive to put 'em all up.

182
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,557
Oh, admit it, Arthur.

183
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,184
You enjoy those vacations from us.

184
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,354
He always comes home
so relaxed.

185
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,606
I'm sure.

186
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:53,235
- You leaving today?
- No, tomorrow, right from work.

187
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,903
There's the where and the when.

188
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,365
An out-of-town kill -
Trinity's own MO.

189
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,950
How poetic.

190
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,410
Well, happy travels.

191
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,787
Take care, Kyle.

192
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,914
Now I need to come up
with my own where and when

193
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,543
to convince my boss
and my wife to let me leave.

194
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,091
All I need is some convention
that smells a little like blood spatter,

195
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,886
something science-y.

196
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,597
Brake and muffler exhibit - no.

197
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,308
Knitting and needlepoint
convention -

198
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,602
no blood there unless
someone impales themselves.

199
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,021
A trade show convention.

200
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,067
Wow, a convention on conventions.

201
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,531
Remember me?

202
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,951
Debra Morgan, sister.

203
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,371
Debra Morgan,
former detective on the Trinity case.

204
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:46,622
Former?

205
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,540
Fucking LaGuerta
took me off the case,

206
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,585
'cause officially I'm a victim
of this cocksucker's crimes.

207
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,089
That's too bad.

208
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,882
Too bad?

209
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,760
(Chuckles) It fucking sucks.

210
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,263
Well, the bright side
is this frees you up

211
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,433
to help the department
in so many ways.

212
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,977
In the course of one day,

213
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:13,482
I go from bringing in the biggest case
Miami Metro has ever seen

214
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,651
to being "freed up in so many ways"?

215
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,861
(Sighs)

216
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,781
I love you, bro, but sometimes
you're a fucking 'tard.

217
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,783
Yeah, I know.

218
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,831
(Computer beeps)

219
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,791
Tampa. What the hell's in Tampa?

220
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,004
Something science-y.

221
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,340
A crime scene is basically
a micro-climate

222
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,716
subject to so many variables.

223
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,428
In the world of blood spatter,
those variables can mean the difference

224
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,304
between good science
and the guilty going free.

225
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,723
Everything from the anomalous
effects of barometric pressure

226
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,852
on particulate liquids
in a high-humidity environment

227
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,020
- to the ionization of...
- Point, please.

228
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,355
Oh.

229
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,566
Meteorological conference, Tampa.

230
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,694
If I let you go, will you stop talking?

231
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,447
You see, learning even more
about hemoglobin dispersion

232
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,700
and the magnetic effects of lightning
in the case of severe thunderstorms

233
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:05,951
could prove invaluable,

234
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,412
because it can all be
considered causal

235
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,873
in the determination
of bloodstain analysis.

236
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,337
Oh...

237
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,505
Is that it?

238
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,883
That's all I could come up with.

239
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,802
Well, it sounds like you're very excited
about this conference.

240
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,431
Not to mention how it will look
when my salary review comes up.

241
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,017
We could start paying
for your college.

242
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,519
I love your dedication...

243
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,230
to work, to this family.

244
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,441
It's one of the reasons
why I married you.

245
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,943
- One of the many, right?
- Right.

246
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,904
- (Harrison coos)
- You know, and, actually,

247
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,697
Elliot's taking the kids fishing,

248
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,825
so they'll be busy
at least one of those days.

249
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,786
He's a good neighbor, that Elliot.

250
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,581
But I do need some space too,

251
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,249
so I'll trade you.

252
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,293
I'll cover the kids this weekend,

253
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,545
and you cover them Tuesday nights
when I go to yoga?

254
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,088
Yoga?

255
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,632
It's the new me.

256
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,383
Well, I like the new you.

257
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,888
Though scheduling my activities

258
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,558
around her downward-facing dog
could prove challenging.

259
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,729
I'll dwell on that later.

260
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,534
What does one pack
for an out-of-town kill?

261
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,745
Got to travel light.
Can't raise suspicion.

262
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,873
I just need a reliable tool,

263
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,042
something I can count on.

264
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,490
Hey!

265
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,659
Oh, you startled me.

266
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,161
Sorry.

267
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,538
- I was hoping to catch a ride to Tampa.
- Kyle...

268
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,790
I need to get away,
even just for the weekend.

269
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,917
Um, I'm sorry.

270
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,712
There'll be other opportunities,
but not this one.

271
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,173
I can't wait.
Arthur, I need to do this.

272
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,260
Give something back to the world.
Make things right.

273
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,931
I can't do that without your help.

274
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,147
I have to get out of here.

275
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,150
Out of here.

276
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,363
Away from this...

277
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,989
feeling, whatever it is.

278
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,574
And with you, I feel focused,

279
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,620
like I have a sense
of purpose and certainty.

280
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,956
I need you.

281
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,084
I...

282
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,462
I have nothing to give you.

283
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,216
Generosity of spirit, Arthur?

284
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,596
I know those are more than just words
to you. Tell me they're not just...

285
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,348
words.

286
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,479
You need my help?

287
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,523
More than you know.

288
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,608
There's nobody else?

289
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,069
You're the one, Arthur.

290
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,280
The only one.

291
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,411
- Well, come on.
- I knew I could count on you.

292
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:34,010
According to Dexter's spatter work,
our suspect is at least six feet tall.

293
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,178
(Quietly) closer to 6'4".

294
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,638
More like 6'4".

295
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,432
The DNA profile
says we're looking

296
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,851
for a Caucasian male
of Northern European descent,

297
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,310
blue eyes...

298
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,438
50 to 70 years old.

299
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:48,483
So we're looking for
a potentially retired, old, white guy.

300
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,026
In Miami?

301
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,486
Great.

302
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,280
And this is the snowbird season.

303
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,031
Which quadruples
our old-white-guy quotient.

304
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:58,827
There's got to be something else we can do,
some other angle...

305
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,287
Uh, DNA sweep.

306
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,498
We could do
a targeted DNA sweep

307
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:07,461
of white males, 60-ish,
in the Miami Metro area.

308
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,671
You know how much work that is?

309
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,048
I've got a big weekend planned.
As in twins.

310
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,801
- You got twins lined up?
- Not yet, but that's the plan.

311
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,180
Besides, the ACLU will shut this down
the minute word gets out.

312
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,848
(Batista) And they always do.

313
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,725
You can't do a roadblock
without drawing some attention.

314
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,894
Uh, it's the weekend.

315
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,314
Um...

316
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,191
Next week's Thanksgiving,

317
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,818
so, uh, the courts will be closed.

318
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,489
Sweeps have worked
in Miami before.

319
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,199
Right, the South Beach rapist,

320
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,035
the robbery-homicide case in '06.

321
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,537
- '07.
- '07.

322
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,207
Wait, wait, who's gonna...
who's gonna pay for all this?

323
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,585
The department's so strapped,
we can't even afford coffee filters.

324
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,797
I used toilet paper to make
the coffee this morning.

325
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,716
If DNA is our only lead,
then DNA is what we'll look for.

326
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,551
Let me worry about the budget.

327
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,679
Masuka, write up a protocol for random
field swabbing that Patrol can follow.

328
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,348
Everything goes through you.

329
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,183
There go my plans.

330
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,020
Happy?

331
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,899
How are we gonna pay for this?

332
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,068
I have no idea.

333
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,530
But I'm about to spend a lot of hours
looking for loose change in the budget.

334
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,157
That's a lot of work.

335
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,867
Want some help?

336
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,703
- Absolutely. Come on in.
- OK.

337
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,581
You know...

338
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,917
the briefing room might be better.

339
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,503
Out in the open?

340
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,755
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah?

341
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,257
Better?

342
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,270
I already feel
the cloud of Farrow lifting

343
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,522
in anticipation of tonight.

344
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,777
So what time do we get started
in the morning?

345
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,988
Six o'clock.

346
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,992
It'll be mostly local guys?

347
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,910
Yeah, women too.

348
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,080
The first kill in his cycle
of three is always a woman,

349
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,582
but he won't get the chance.

350
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,293
- Do we all stay at the same hotel?
- I don't know.

351
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,086
Is it close to the build?

352
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,132
It's walking distance.

353
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,218
- Does everybody hang out together or...
- Good Lord, you have a lot of questions.

354
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,555
Sorry.

355
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,268
You told me you were troubled.
About what?

356
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,445
I did something. (Sighs)

357
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,323
Well, let's hear it.

358
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,532
I made a mistake.

359
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,701
- We all make mistakes.
- It was a big one.

360
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:48,163
You're being purposely vague, Kyle,

361
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,123
like one of my tenth-graders

362
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,835
who's trying to explain
why he didn't do his homework.

363
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,547
I have a feeling I'm gonna
make some tenth-graders very happy.

364
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,132
Pit stop.

365
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,198
- You're a brave man, Kyle.
- How so?

366
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,241
Eating from a vending machine.

367
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:28,286
Years of training - iron stomach.

368
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,331
Maybe you could show
some of that same bravery

369
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,042
by sharing what's bothering you.

370
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:40,090
How am I supposed to help you
when I don't know what the problem is?

371
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,175
- It's not that important.
- It's important to me.

372
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,927
Why?

373
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:47,347
Because helping someone is a good deed,
and God rewards good deeds,

374
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,100
but in order to help, I need to know
the problem. That's how these things work.

375
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,351
I really don't want to talk about it.

376
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,771
You asked me, remember?
That's why I brought you.

377
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,524
- Why don't we just...
- Tell me, Kyle!

378
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,736
I'm gonna get into my van and just
leave you here to fend for yourself.

379
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,863
I killed a man.

380
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,417
You killed someone?

381
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,420
You, of all people, act appalled.

382
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:21,548
- By mistake.
- How? What happened?

383
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,342
I thought he was the right...

384
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,601
I thought he was an animal.

385
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,147
You... You were hunting?

386
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,734
Yes, it was a hunting accident.

387
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,487
I was so sure.
I'm always so careful.

388
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,282
Then it truly was an accident.

389
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,617
Still, it's left me with this...

390
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,913
feeling.

391
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,377
There are few things
harder to bear than remorse.

392
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,796
Remorse?

393
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,298
Guilt. Remorse.

394
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,550
It's what separates us
from the animals.

395
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:11,264
Your conscience
is eating away at you.

396
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,685
But you're gonna feel better.

397
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,854
Confession is good for the soul.

398
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,815
All the more proof I have no soul.

399
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:25,820
Doing good deeds,
scoring points with God.

400
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,952
You and I are way beyond
the point system, Arthur.

401
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,955
The best deed I can do
is rid the world of you.

402
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,170
A fitting kill room.

403
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:45,215
Small, but I'll be
cutting him down to size.

404
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,804
I just need to pick up a few supplies.

405
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,307
(Cell phone rings)

406
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,770
- Hey, Deb.
- How's the weather?

407
00:23:58,896 --> 00:23:59,896
Funny.

408
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:03,691
You talking climate
with a bunch of dorks and nerds,

409
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:04,984
you really lead the life.

410
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,987
Is there a reason for this call?
It's getting late.

411
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:11,574
That jumper out at the warehouse,
you took a bunch of crime-scene photos.

412
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,701
Did you put them all in the file?

413
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:18,164
I take a lot of photos.
I don't use 'em all.

414
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,500
- But you save them?
- I do.

415
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,211
I want to look through 'em,
see if I can find any ash smudges.

416
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,338
Well, they're all
on the lab computer.

417
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,382
Masuka can access 'em for you.

418
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,884
- I can't ask Masuka.
- Why?

419
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,678
Because I'm not working this case.

420
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,473
- Could've fooled me.
- I know, right?

421
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,350
At least I got Quinn to start
DNA sweeps tomorrow.

422
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,310
That's something anyway, right?

423
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,229
DNA sweeps?

424
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,398
Yeah, we're gonna do
random cheek swabs

425
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:46,776
on tall white men over 50,
preferably with blue eyes.

426
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,403
Good luck with that.

427
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,779
Thanks.

428
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:54,117
Hey, you run into
that weather guy, Sonny Skyes,

429
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,910
you tell him he's got a stupid name.

430
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,745
Will do.

431
00:24:57,872 --> 00:24:59,873
But first a little shopping.

432
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,089
Oh. (Chuckles)

433
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,465
Are you headed out?

434
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,759
- Yeah, for ice.
- Change of plan for tomorrow.

435
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:14,762
We're not going to the build.
I got a surprise for you instead.

436
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:18,266
Uh... I don't like surprises.

437
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:21,019
You'll like this one.
It'll make you feel better.

438
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,110
How will it make me feel better?

439
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,906
Could he have some kind of formula
for remorse or something?

440
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,702
If anyone does, it'd be him.

441
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,705
It's not like I can't kill him tomorrow night.

442
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,876
Good. So far we've saved...

443
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,920
$24,000.

444
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,465
- Not bad.
- Mm, it's not enough.

445
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:53,760
We need at least 12 more.

446
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,433
What?

447
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,936
Your hair.

448
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,979
- My heart skips a beat.
- Stop it.

449
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,106
And thank you.

450
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,652
What time is it? Dios mio.

451
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,779
It's late.

452
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,948
We're the last ones here.

453
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,461
- (Door opens)
- Yo!

454
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,130
You're still here.

455
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:35,218
Me and a bunch of guys were at the bar.
I came back with some good news.

456
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,845
They want to donate
a vacation day to help pay

457
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:40,014
for this DNA-sweep thing.

458
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,641
That's amazing, bro.

459
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,935
Fucker shot one of our own.

460
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,564
Look at this. All those days.

461
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:51,401
It's enough. It fills the gap.

462
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,037
(Sighs)

463
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,708
(Elevator bell dings)

464
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,463
(Lock clicks)

465
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,800
Fuck it.

466
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,056
- Papi...
- (Batista groans)

467
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,891
(LaGuerta) Si.

468
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,186
(Knock at door)

469
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,441
Who the fuck is it?

470
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,109
(Christine) It's me.

471
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,279
I called, but you didn't pick up.

472
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,242
(Sighs) I know it's late,
but I've had the worst day.

473
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,703
I'm sorry, babe, but I...

474
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,247
I could lose my job.

475
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,666
Not like I'm the only one.
Being a journalist these days

476
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,085
is a straight ticket
to the unemployment line.

477
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,339
- You're not gonna lose your job.
- My editor laid it out.

478
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,800
He said either I get
"a lead that bleeds,"

479
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,553
or basically I'm done.

480
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,222
So you're here.

481
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,101
What?

482
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:11,272
Look, Christy, I'm half-asleep
and half in the bag.

483
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,899
I can't give you anything.

484
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,110
How about a little support?

485
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,654
You know, like a hug?

486
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,448
Or an "everything's
gonna be all right"?

487
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,408
Everything's gonna be all right.

488
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,079
- That's bullshit.
- Hey, come here.

489
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,832
It is gonna be all right,

490
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,959
'cause you're a kick-ass reporter,

491
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:34,170
and I'm gonna help you
dig something up,

492
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,756
just not in Homicide.

493
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,429
Maybe you should stay.

494
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,149
Not if you're on the fence.

495
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,527
I'll see you tomorrow.

496
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,661
Quick cab to
the meteorological conference.

497
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,788
Check in, establish an alibi.

498
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,998
- I'll be back in time to...
- Kyle!

499
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,041
Hey.

500
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,501
You're an early bird too, huh?

501
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:16,629
Yeah, how else
would I catch the worm?

502
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,800
Yeah, I'm so excited about today's surprise,
I practically sprang out of bed.

503
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:21,843
(Laughs)

504
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,178
- You ready for this?
- So ready.

505
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,723
(Laughs) That's the spirit. Mmm!

506
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,725
Come on.

507
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:30,852
(Door shuts)

508
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,187
Yesterday he's jumping down my throat,

509
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,690
today he's the happy dancing man.

510
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,025
Is that mask of his crumbling?

511
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,672
Oh, Frank.

512
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:08,556
So I was thinking, it might not be
a bad idea to ask Masuka...

513
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:12,059
Oh, fuck me. Don't you have other cases
you should be working on?

514
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,978
I'm trying to help you.

515
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,814
Maybe you should ask Masuka
if you could get Dexter's old discard photos

516
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,609
from the Tarla Grant crime scene.

517
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,402
You know, Tarla Grant,
the supposed jumper?

518
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,237
Yeah, I know who Tarla Grant is.

519
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,072
Why do I care
about your brother's snaps?

520
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:28,409
Well, because if she's one of Trinity's
victims, you might find an ash smudge.

521
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,370
So basically I'm your tool. That it?

522
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,499
Yeah. That's it.

523
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:38,211
I'm using you to make you look good,
but I wouldn't want you to feel like a tool.

524
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,721
Make sure each kit
gets a chain-of-custody sticker.

525
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,434
These swab things gonna take
a long time to turn around?

526
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,646
Well, in the real world, yes,
but since I'm organizing it,

527
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,815
we've got mad mojo,
top-of-the-pile action going on.

528
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:02,151
Come on, people, the faster
we get 'em out in the field,

529
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,403
the faster we get 'em
back here digesting.

530
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,406
You got access to Dexter's
discard crime-scene photos?

531
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,617
We share everything.

532
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,328
- Not in a gay way.
- Yeah, that jumper, Tarla Grant,

533
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,747
maybe he accidentally
snapped a smudge or something.

534
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,959
Good idea, especially from you.

535
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,461
And one more thing I have to handle
while he's at his conference.

536
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,422
You guys and your
fucking geek fests.

537
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,385
I'll have you know,

538
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,179
I've almost banged so much tail
at those "geek fests".

539
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,223
Sure. You.

540
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,308
But Poindexter?

541
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,520
Dexter is pure jungle cat.

542
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,564
You should've seen
the hot English muffin

543
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,984
he was "bow-chicka-wowing" a couple
years ago...while he was dating Rita.

544
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,861
- Huh.
- Lila was insane.

545
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:47,697
Literally.

546
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,699
I could tell you stories.

547
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,576
Really?

548
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,329
Mom! Look, I caught one!

549
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,331
Wow! That's a monster.

550
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,166
Yeah, and Astor caught
the biggest fish of the day.

551
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:01,544
Come on, show your mom.

552
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,670
Impressive.

553
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,298
- No biggie, just lucky.
- Can we eat him?

554
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,675
Absolutely, but we have to wait
till Dexter comes home.

555
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,010
He's the fish gutter around here.

556
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,678
I clean a pretty decent fish.

557
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,681
Oh, no, it's all right. You don't have to.

558
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,224
No, please, my pleasure.

559
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,352
How about I clean 'em, you cook 'em,
and we all eat 'em together?

560
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,021
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

561
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:23,649
All right. I do make
a mean mango salsa.

562
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:27,486
All right. Kids, fishies, to the sink.

563
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,659
What are we doing here?

564
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,494
Trying to help you.

565
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,046
(Doorbell ringing)

566
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:48,591
Hello, my name is Arthur Mitchell.
This is my friend Kyle Butler.

567
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,719
- No, thank you.
- I'm not trying to sell anything.

568
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,680
You see, I grew up in this house
many years ago.

569
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,390
I was hoping to take a look.

570
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,392
We'll just take a minute.
We'll be out before you know it.

571
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,603
(Both speaking Korean)

572
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,521
(Arthur) Upstairs!

573
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:03,939
You have a lovely home.

574
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:07,693
(Both speak Korean)

575
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,539
(Door creaks)

576
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,629
A bathroom?

577
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:31,092
This is where it all started.

578
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,718
What started here?

579
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,142
I was standing here...

580
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,064
watching my sister take a shower.

581
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,817
You were watching your sister?

582
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:51,570
I was ten. It was innocent.

583
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:55,408
But Vera saw me...

584
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,535
in the mirror.

585
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,081
I startled her,
and she slipped...

586
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,292
shattered the shower doors.

587
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,086
The glass...

588
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,216
sliced her leg.

589
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,599
She was dead by the time
the ambulance came.

590
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:26,355
So much blood.

591
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,650
Born in blood, both of us.

592
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,153
My parents blamed me.

593
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:37,825
My mother became a shell, a ghost.

594
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:41,662
She eventually killed herself.

595
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,956
Jumped to her death.

596
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,667
Left me all alone...

597
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,794
with him.

598
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,090
He was always a drinker...

599
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,218
but without Mother,
it became worse.

600
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,429
So did the beatings.

601
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:01,390
"Little fucking pervert,

602
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,976
"fucking cunt, you killed them."

603
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,773
What happened to him?

604
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,778
He died.

605
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:15,696
No, you killed your father.

606
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,823
I'm betting hammer.

607
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,918
I never told anyone...

608
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,045
any of this.

609
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,674
Why did you tell me?

610
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,928
So you'd know you're not alone.
You're just like me.

611
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:42,223
We're both responsible
for the death of an innocent.

612
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,350
We share that.

613
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,527
You feel better?

614
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,572
You have to go now! Leave!

615
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,658
- I call the police!
- Don't be absurd.

616
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,743
Uh... Why don't we grab some lunch?

617
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,703
I heard about a great place
back in Tampa.

618
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,456
Yeah. Lunch does sound good.

619
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:09,542
Sorry.

620
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,008
Little coffee with that sugar?

621
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:21,303
Can't beat the combo -
caffeine and sugar rush.

622
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,601
Quinn's out on a warrant check.

623
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,104
Actually, I'm here to see you.

624
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,690
I don't know nothing about nothing.

625
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,778
Not even about the DNA roadblocks
popping up all over the city?

626
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,120
Quinn's been fucking with you.

627
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,247
And not in that
heavy-breathing kind of way.

628
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,834
Yeah, if I got it from him,
would I be asking you?

629
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,920
Are the sweeps connected
to the shootings of Agent Lundy and...

630
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,297
We're just dragging for drunk drivers.

631
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,591
We toss up roadblocks all the time
around the holidays.

632
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,593
Yeah, Patrol.

633
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,761
Not Homicide.

634
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,013
Why the DNA testing?

635
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:07,099
Uh, Lieutenant's idea.
Got a lot of open cases.

636
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,310
She's trying to up her solve rate.

637
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,644
Really no story here.

638
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,438
Yeah, well, it's all I got.

639
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,189
My editor's breathing down
my neck, so...

640
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:16,400
Well, you'll embarrass yourself.

641
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:17,484
(Chuckles)

642
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:21,280
Look, I know it's really tough
for reporters right now.

643
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:24,408
And as girls we've got to
double-prove ourselves.

644
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,495
So maybe instead of this one,

645
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:32,166
I can give you that interview
you've been wanting from me.

646
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,876
Are you serious?

647
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:37,129
As long as you
make me look good.

648
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,715
Call me. We'll set up a time.

649
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,803
Yeah.

650
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,266
Uh, two.

651
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,151
This is the great place
you heard about,

652
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,527
a hotel coffee shop?

653
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:04,448
Well, it says their tuna melts
are "taste-tastic".

654
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,162
I'm gonna go to the men's room.
Would you order me a...

655
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,456
- A tuna melt?
- Yeah.

656
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:28,222
Uh, Dexter Morgan.
Sorry I'm late.

657
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,600
Thank you.

658
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,482
(Man) Hey, Sonny Skyes.
Love you, man.

659
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,067
Hey, Sonny Skyes?

660
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,777
That would be me. Hi.

661
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:45,114
Do you mind?
My wife is a huge fan.

662
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,032
Sure.

663
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,243
- Oops. Here we go.
- (Chuckles)

664
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,999
- Fantastic. Thanks.
- Great. Thank you.

665
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,585
(Phone beeping)

666
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,466
Alibi - check.

667
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,385
Arthur next.

668
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,596
- No, no, no!
- Come on, he wants a smooch.

669
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:12,933
Come here! Come kiss Mr. Fish head now.
Kiss Mr. Fish lips.

670
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,101
That's disgusting!

671
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:17,646
- Don't leave Mr. Fish...
- (Screams)

672
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,652
Kyle! Over here!

673
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,071
- Hey, where you been?
- Sorry, there was a line.

674
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,783
No, no, gave me a chance
to say hello to the neighbors.

675
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:33,120
Kyle Butler, this is, uh,
Bob and Sally Moore of Sarasota,

676
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,831
Their beautiful daughter Hanna,
and their son, uh...

677
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,958
Spencer!

678
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,460
- Hi.
- Sit, sit.

679
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,920
- There's plenty of room, right, Bob?
- I guess.

680
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,339
I've been telling them
about our...our morning.

681
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:45,591
What about our morning?

682
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,301
You know, how we visited
my childhood home.

683
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,803
I showed you the bathroom
where my sister died.

684
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,972
Kids don't need to hear
any more about that.

685
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,766
Bob, they should learn
to speak the truth.

686
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,350
I think they know
how to speak the truth.

687
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:57,394
We all need to confess our mistakes,

688
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,521
so we can go into the light unburdened.

689
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,149
That's what Kyle
taught me yesterday.

690
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,692
- (Sighs)
- Not on purpose.

691
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,861
It was such a revelation to me

692
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,530
when he told me what he did.

693
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,283
Huh?

694
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,287
- We're leaving.
- What about your tuna melt?

695
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,540
These folks want to enjoy
their family time alone.

696
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,420
Let's go.

697
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,677
That was rather rude.

698
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,180
Yeah, sorry.
I'm just not as open as you are.

699
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:35,265
It's the remorse.
You need to shed it.

700
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,643
Believe me, I'm trying,
but there's only one thing that'll do it.

701
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,853
- What's that?
- Giving.

702
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,231
Is it OK if we stop by
a hardware store?

703
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:45,484
I want to pick up some things to donate
to the Four Walls build tomorrow.

704
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,821
That's an excellent idea.

705
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:01,250
- (Door opens)
- (Humming)

706
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,377
Morgan.

707
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:04,545
Lieutenant.

708
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,255
What are you doing?

709
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,549
Nothing.

710
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,509
Why were you singing?

711
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,721
I wasn't singing. I was humming.
People have been known to hum.

712
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:16,682
Not without reason.

713
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:19,601
You happy about something?

714
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,020
Are you hiding something?

715
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:23,939
Are you?

716
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,695
(Humming)

717
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,872
Oh...

718
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,253
Dissolving stitches my ass.

719
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,549
Fuck me.

720
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,558
Mother shit fuck.

721
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,403
How tall was my shooter?

722
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:16,700
These wounds have a trajectory
that's totally fucking straight.

723
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,248
Jesus, Masuka, they're just tits.

724
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,543
But they're yours - perky, perfect.

725
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,129
Grow the fuck up and tell me
how tall my shooter is.

726
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,632
Uh, if it was the Trinity Killer,

727
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:34,676
then he's about 6'4".

728
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,435
Up.

729
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,525
That puts you
at about his height.

730
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:53,654
So if you're Trinity, how exactly do you
shoot me and get wounds like this?

731
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:58,158
Casings and GSR
from your shirt put you about...

732
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,662
about five feet away.

733
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,205
So I'm 6'4",

734
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:07,167
and the vast majority of shooters
hold their guns like this.

735
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,670
Unless he's trying
not to attract attention.

736
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,338
Then like this.

737
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:17,386
Either way, to hit you on the side
from up here,

738
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:21,139
I got to shoot you
with a downward trajectory.

739
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:24,851
There's nothing downward about this.
It's completely level.

740
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,186
Unless I'm kneeling.

741
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,314
But then again, I'm, like, 60,
and I got to be mobile.

742
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,193
Plus Lundy would've reacted
to some old guy kneeling behind me.

743
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,195
I remember his face exactly.

744
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:38,115
- So I'm not kneeling.
- Then how tall is he?

745
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,167
My height, approximately.

746
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:53,714
Oh, fucking fuck.

747
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,051
Then it wasn't Trinity.

748
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,219
Nope.

749
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,346
Then who the fuck shot me?

750
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:10,022
Nothing like the spirit of charity
to make the heart right.

751
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,191
About time I gave back.

752
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:17,237
It's a good call with
the plastic sheeting, by the way.

753
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,948
This is Florida. You never know
when it's gonna rain.

754
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,742
(Yawns)

755
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:27,331
Ah, compadre, I don't know
about you, but I'm bushed.

756
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,625
We're kindred spirits, you and I.

757
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,797
Keep doing good work.

758
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,883
Oh, I will.

759
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,269
Just go to sleep.

760
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,937
No more surprises.

761
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:52,272
(Door closes)

762
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,399
(Muffled TV noise)

763
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,526
Good enough.

764
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:05,952
(Rita) You know what's great?

765
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,288
- Your mango salsa?
- (Laughs)

766
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,915
Wine.

767
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,459
Nine months without it sucked.

768
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:13,668
(Both laugh)

769
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:15,962
- You want to polish this off?
- No, I'm...

770
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:17,589
I'm already pretty buzzed.

771
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,841
Oh, lightweight.

772
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,136
Yeah. If you'd said that 15 years ago,
nobody would've believed you.

773
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,847
Oh, so you weren't
always a soccer mom?

774
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,141
Mm, are you kidding?

775
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,894
I was a dress-over-the-head party girl.

776
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:34,815
Oh, God, did I just say that?

777
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:36,525
(Laughs)

778
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:37,859
You must think I'm...

779
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,569
Totally charming.

780
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,124
I, um...
I better start cleaning up.

781
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,836
- Yeah, let me...let me help you.
- No, no. It's getting late.

782
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:58,171
I'm sure you want to get home.

783
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,590
Right. I'll, uh, get the kids.

784
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,714
Where the fuck did you go?

785
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:36,228
He's on foot.

786
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,896
With his tools.

787
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,774
The Four Walls build.

788
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,610
A little early, but walking distance.

789
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,165
Empty, no security.

790
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:15,058
Just me, Arthur, and a little M-99.

791
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,819
No more confessions,
no more good deeds,

792
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,113
and no more fucking remorse.

793
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,581
(Breathing heavily)

794
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,209
What are you doing?

795
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:46,590
No, you're mine.

796
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:50,135
(Grunting)

797
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,513
This isn't how you die.

798
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,390
Let go!

799
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:59,603
Why keep him alive
just to kill him?

800
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:05,817
But as long as it's by my hand...

801
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:11,031
Gotcha! Gotcha!

802
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,365
Hold on.

803
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,367
Give me your hand.

804
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,077
(Grunting)

805
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:23,084
This is his solution
to remorse - suicide.

806
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,587
That's why he could unburden himself.

807
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,839
He knew this was next.

808
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:31,676
Will it be my only solution someday?

809
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:37,932
I thought God sent you
so that I could save you.

810
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,060
But God had another plan.

811
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,853
So did I.

812
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,897
He sent you to save me.

813
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:46,483
- Not exactly.
- (Man) You're a hero.

814
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,280
Thank you.

815
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:57,202
(People chattering)

816
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,956
So much for anonymity.

817
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:04,918
Arthur Mitchell,
you just got a reprieve.

818
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,259
So the Trinity Killer
didn't shoot you and Lundy.

819
00:50:13,386 --> 00:50:14,344
Nope.

820
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,262
Someone Masuka's size shot you.

821
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:17,263
Yep.

822
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,307
- That's all we got to go on Lundy's case?
- That's it.

823
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:23,812
Well, the upside is there's no longer a
conflict of interest for you in the Trinity case.

824
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:26,356
You mean I can work it again?

825
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,442
Thank Christ,
no more backseat driving.

826
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:33,113
Nobody knows this case
better than you. You're taking lead.

827
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:35,615
Motherfucker, really?

828
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,201
- Well, what about Lundy's case?
- That's my case now.

829
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:42,497
Don't worry, I'm gonna find
the shithead that shot you.

830
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:43,748
Oh, oh, whoa...

831
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,792
- Oh, are you OK?
- I'm f... I'm fine.

832
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:46,918
You OK?

833
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,795
(Laughs)

834
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:52,799
- Well, we're done here.
- We're done.

835
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:56,761
Morgan, update the squad
at three o'clock, please.

836
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,182
Glad that didn't happen last night.

837
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,062
Any regrets?

838
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,940
That we didn't have breakfast together.

839
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:18,366
At least I'll get Trinity.

840
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:21,411
Promise.

841
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:32,922
I've killed an innocent man,
and I've saved a guilty one.

842
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,177
I won't make that mistake again.

843
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,054
Is that the purpose of remorse,

844
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:42,974
to keep you from repeating mistakes?

845
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:48,062
You're watching me.

846
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,649
I'm just concerned.

847
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,695
No need. I was confused before.

848
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,697
But you're not anymore.

849
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,700
No. Embarrassed, perhaps.

850
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,286
In fact, I'd appreciate it

851
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:07,040
if you'd think of
this weekend's events as a...

852
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,292
a little accident.

853
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:13,004
You stepped off a roof.

854
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,465
It was a mistake.

855
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,010
We all make them.

856
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,056
(Arthur) Don't worry.

857
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:25,725
Your accident
will never be spoken of by me.

858
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,811
To err is human.

859
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:35,276
Little early for a drunk-driving checkpoint.

860
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:39,239
Looks like one of Debra's DNA sweeps.

861
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:42,283
(Woman) Stand over here, sir, please.

862
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,369
(Man) You, sir, pull over here.

863
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,415
(Man) Step on out of the car, sir, please.

864
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:51,751
Yeah, I heard about this on the radio.

865
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:55,547
The police are looking
for some huge serial killer.

866
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:59,676
They have his DNA.
They're looking for a match.

867
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:03,555
Sounds scary.

868
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:07,183
Exactly how much
do you want to live, Arthur?

869
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:13,690
I think this gentleman in the red car
has the right idea. This line is endless.

870
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,319
What say we take the scenic route?

871
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,780
Yeah, sure, Arthur.

872
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,078
A changed man at peace with himself.

873
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:33,084
Maybe only monsters feel no regret.

874
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:40,258
If erring is human,
then remorse must be too.

875
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:46,306
Wait, does that make me human?

876
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:48,433
Huh.
