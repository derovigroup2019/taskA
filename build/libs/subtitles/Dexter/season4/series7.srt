1
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:48,417
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:49,950
Deb's alive.

3
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:51,284
They're taking her to the hospital.

4
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:52,384
Trinity's a monster.

5
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:53,517
If he was the one who hurt your sister

6
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:54,650
You need to kill him.

7
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:56,384
I'm gonna follow Lundy's theory

8
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:57,716
And check his hotel room for clues.

9
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,583
You can't let these be logged into evidence.

10
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:00,783
I've been going over

11
00:02:00,817 --> 00:02:02,284
Everything collected from Lundy's hotel

12
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:03,917
And some of it's missing.

13
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,451
If you say that you saw me kill Frank Lundy,

14
00:02:07,484 --> 00:02:08,750
Then you're the liar.

15
00:02:08,783 --> 00:02:10,883
Nikki wald didn't kill Lundy. how do you know?

16
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:12,583
'cause somebody stole Lundy's Trinity research.

17
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:13,783
And there's only one person

18
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:14,950
Who would have a reason to do that.

19
00:02:14,983 --> 00:02:18,084
Me? Trinity.

20
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:19,850
If you could just help me

21
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:21,683
Get an interview with Debra Morgan.

22
00:02:21,716 --> 00:02:22,950
You gotta be kidding me.

23
00:02:22,983 --> 00:02:24,917
It'd be a hero piece about the shooting.

24
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,150
No, add to that the fact

25
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:28,250
That her brother has a bug up his ass about me.

26
00:02:28,284 --> 00:02:29,983
I don't care if you're a dirty cop--

27
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,517
Don't fucking call me dirty.

28
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,683
Last thing I need is a cop mad at me.

29
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:36,050
How are we supposed to decide what's more important?

30
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:37,484
Our jobs or each other?

31
00:02:37,517 --> 00:02:40,184
It's over... right.

32
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:42,284
Sorry.

33
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:43,616
I'm halfway through the c.i. files you gave me.

34
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,451
Maybe then i'll finally get some answers.

35
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:46,716
I think I know who dad was fucking.

36
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,983
What--wait, who?

37
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:50,817
I'll tell you when I know more.

38
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,650
I know almost everything about you, arthur.

39
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:54,783
Except where you hide,

40
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:57,517
The dates and locations from Lundy's books.

41
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:58,850
Arthur's been using four walls builds

42
00:02:58,883 --> 00:03:01,551
Around the country as a cover to kill.

43
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,184
And these are his trophies...

44
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,417
Hanging right up here on the wall.

45
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:07,583
He's hiding in plain site

46
00:03:07,616 --> 00:03:09,616
Right in the center of his family.

47
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,616
How does he do it?

48
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,683
Only way we're gonna work

49
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:14,817
Is if I jumped in with both feet.

50
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,384
Jump in with both feet.

51
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:31,451
There's a moment sailors call slack tide.

52
00:03:31,484 --> 00:03:34,384
When the tide is neither coming in nor going out,

53
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:37,750
But perfectly still.

54
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:39,417
It's a moment frozen in time.

55
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:44,417
When all is calm and peaceful.

56
00:03:48,883 --> 00:03:52,783
The only downside to it is it passes so quickly.

57
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:55,783
Morgan...

58
00:03:55,817 --> 00:03:57,317
Yeah, text me the address.

59
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,817
Gotta go home. dead body.

60
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,284
We should get back anyway I got a lot to do.

61
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:03,484
I start work again tomorrow.

62
00:04:03,517 --> 00:04:05,451
And you move into your new apartment.

63
00:04:05,484 --> 00:04:07,983
Yeah, taking over Dexter's old bachelor pad.

64
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:10,583
You can take me there on the way home.

65
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,484
As much as we might like some things

66
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:16,317
To remain suspended in time, they never do.

67
00:04:30,217 --> 00:04:32,950
Okay, not what I was expecting.

68
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:37,683
Well, here's the real surprise.

69
00:04:37,716 --> 00:04:41,817
Mr. nix found the alligator on his driveway.

70
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,150
Come up here all the time.

71
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:45,184
Try to eat my dogs.

72
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:47,017
This one I was gonna eat.

73
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,883
He shot the animal in the head.

74
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:51,783
He started to gut him and he found the arm.

75
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,250
Adult female...

76
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:02,616
No blood flow from the ruptured blood vessels.

77
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,750
The bite was post-mortem.

78
00:05:04,783 --> 00:05:06,917
What's this?

79
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,050
Ligature marks.

80
00:05:08,084 --> 00:05:10,417
Her wrists were tied.

81
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:11,783
I'm guessing the gator didn't do that.

82
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:15,050
Well, we got a homicide, guys.

83
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:16,050
Alligator alley,

84
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:17,716
A perfect spot to dump the body.

85
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,117
And knowing that it won't last.

86
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,084
I'll test for fingerprints.

87
00:05:22,117 --> 00:05:23,783
Let's get a search team here.

88
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:25,451
Maybe they could find some more body parts.

89
00:05:25,484 --> 00:05:27,184
A head would be nice.

90
00:05:35,517 --> 00:05:36,883
Dexter, finally.

91
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:39,716
You have to help me finish my report on african animals.

92
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,150
No, I need him to put up the shelves in my room.

93
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:44,217
Actually, guys, it's been a long day and I'm kinda--

94
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,783
Go easy on him. he's only one person.

95
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:47,817
That you know of.

96
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,917
First, you'll help cody, then astor

97
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,317
And then you're gonna help me

98
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,317
Put harrison's baby bouncer together.

99
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,117
That's a lot of helping.

100
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,551
Well, that's what daddies are for.

101
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:07,850
"Debra, call me. I'd love to speak to you."

102
00:06:07,883 --> 00:06:09,150
She called the other day too.

103
00:06:09,184 --> 00:06:12,050
She wants to do a hero piece on Deb for the paper.

104
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:13,850
The last thing I need is a reporter

105
00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:17,516
Snooping around my house, my family, me.

106
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,150
I'm sick of explaining it to you.

107
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:20,516
It's like you don't even listen to me.

108
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,317
Maybe I would listen more if the things you said--

109
00:06:22,351 --> 00:06:24,250
I've been hearing them a lot lately.

110
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:28,317
They don't sound very happy, do they?

111
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,616
Better to find out now before they get married.

112
00:06:34,384 --> 00:06:36,783
You and I are doing better, right?

113
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:37,950
Much better.

114
00:06:37,984 --> 00:06:39,750
I'm happy we're in therapy.

115
00:06:39,783 --> 00:06:42,184
You've really opened up to me a lot lately, Dexter.

116
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:43,883
Don't you think?

117
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:46,384
Absolutely.

118
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:50,850
Dexter, I'm waiting.

119
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:53,883
Dear abby, I'm a serial killer.

120
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:55,883
I need advice on how to keep my kids

121
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:58,250
From taking over my life.

122
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,616
No...

123
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,483
There's only one person who can help me.

124
00:07:10,284 --> 00:07:12,284
Arthur?

125
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:13,417
Hey...

126
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:16,084
Hey, kyle. morning.

127
00:07:16,117 --> 00:07:17,117
Doing a little shopping?

128
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,017
Yeah, just a few things.

129
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,317
You?

130
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:23,616
Yeah, we needed some supplies for the next build.

131
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,817
Let me give you a hand. oh, thank you.

132
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,117
I'll help you load it up.

133
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,750
Oh, good.

134
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,817
So jonah's not around to help you this morning?

135
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,917
No, he's got rotc in the morning,

136
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,184
Football practice in the afternoon,

137
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:41,583
And no time to help out his dad.

138
00:07:41,616 --> 00:07:42,750
That's too bad.

139
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:45,150
No, no. it's a good thing.

140
00:07:45,184 --> 00:07:46,750
Is it?

141
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:48,084
Kyle, you're a father.

142
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:49,950
You know we're responsible

143
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:52,017
To push our children out into the world.

144
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,417
To make them prepared and self-sufficient.

145
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:59,317
Right, yeah, of course.

146
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:01,750
Push them out. right.

147
00:08:01,783 --> 00:08:03,417
How do you do that?

148
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:07,417
You have to encourage their outside interests.

149
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:11,284
Jonah's got all his activities and rebecca's got her ballet

150
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:15,516
And she has college-level science classes.

151
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,384
That sounds very busy.

152
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:21,217
Well, so busy that I hardly get to see them.

153
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,284
And they hardly get to see you.

154
00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:25,184
Allowing you to do whatever you want.

155
00:08:25,217 --> 00:08:27,516
Simple advice, but there's got to be more.

156
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,817
So hey, if you ever need any extra help,

157
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,984
Just let me know.

158
00:08:31,017 --> 00:08:31,984
Oh, thank you.

159
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:33,483
Really, I mean it.

160
00:08:33,516 --> 00:08:34,550
Absolutely.

161
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,451
It's just that--

162
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:39,616
Just what?

163
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,717
Well...

164
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,483
Honestly, I'm new here and without my family,

165
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:46,550
I don't know anybody.

166
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,984
So...

167
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,650
What are you doing tomorrow morning?

168
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:56,850
Nothing.

169
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:59,150
Meet me at my house.

170
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:00,384
6:30.

171
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:02,417
Okay.

172
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:11,250
Hey, Deb, great to see you.

173
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,984
Welcome back, detective.

174
00:09:13,017 --> 00:09:15,317
Welcome back. thanks.

175
00:09:15,351 --> 00:09:16,917
Hey.

176
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,583
You're getting the hero's welcome, I see.

177
00:09:18,616 --> 00:09:20,217
Hey, welcome back.

178
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,717
It's not like they haven't seen me, i've been around.

179
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,683
Yeah, but now you're officially back.

180
00:09:23,717 --> 00:09:27,050
So glad you're okay.

181
00:09:27,084 --> 00:09:29,050
Who was that?

182
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:30,550
I have no fucking clue.

183
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,683
Take a bullet and suddenly

184
00:09:31,717 --> 00:09:33,683
You're everybody's best friend.

185
00:09:33,717 --> 00:09:36,516
Oh, on the house.

186
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,950
Welcome back.

187
00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:43,050
Fat Jesus on a bike, get me out of here.

188
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:45,950
Cover me, bro.

189
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:48,184
Hi, Dexter Morgan.

190
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:52,117
Of course. we met before.

191
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,883
Uh, excuse me, I have to talk--

192
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:55,783
Yeah, that's why I'm stopping you.

193
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:57,317
As a favor to me,

194
00:09:57,351 --> 00:10:01,417
I'd really like you to not write about my sister.

195
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:02,883
I think she'll make a great story.

196
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:04,250
I should interview you as well.

197
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:05,650
You can give me some background--

198
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:08,084
No, Debra's recovering from a serious injury.

199
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:10,550
She needs to be left alone.

200
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,184
Stay away.

201
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:17,917
Why don't you, uh, get us a couple coffees.

202
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,384
What's with the attitude?

203
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:20,850
She's just trying to do her job.

204
00:10:20,883 --> 00:10:22,883
Everybody's trying to get a piece of Debra right now.

205
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:23,950
She's been through a lot.

206
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:26,117
Your sister's a big girl.

207
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,417
And she can take care of herself.

208
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:32,117
I don't see why this is any of your business.

209
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,583
Look, I know you and I have had our little differences.

210
00:10:34,616 --> 00:10:36,717
You might want to keep in mind how all that started.

211
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,917
So what are you saying?

212
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,117
I'm saying the guy who saw the other guy

213
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,217
Steal the money from the crime scene

214
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,817
Wants christine kept away.

215
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:50,084
Sorry...

216
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,817
Sorry I'm late.

217
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,150
Actually, that's bullshit. I'm not late.

218
00:10:56,184 --> 00:10:57,817
I was hiding at the end of the hall

219
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,683
So I could tell you all at once and get it over with.

220
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:00,917
Um...

221
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,650
Thank you, I'm great.

222
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:03,984
No, I don't need your help,

223
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:06,351
And no I'm not gonna show you the scar.

224
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:09,017
So please, can we just fucking move on?

225
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,516
And, uh, why is there a picture

226
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,483
Of a fucking arm up there?

227
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:16,284
Well, let's all welcome back detective fuckin' Morgan.

228
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:21,783
I was just about to ask sergeant batista

229
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:23,783
To update us on his case.

230
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:27,583
Based on the fingerprints, we've i.d.'d the victim

231
00:11:27,616 --> 00:11:31,284
As estrella carazo-- 19 years old.

232
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:33,650
She is a citizen of nicaragua,

233
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:35,850
Here on an expired visa.

234
00:11:35,883 --> 00:11:37,284
Uh, the m.e. estimates that the arm

235
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:39,817
Was ingested less than 72 hours ago

236
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:44,384
And the time of death less than 24 hours prior to that.

237
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:46,184
She worked as a cocktail waitress

238
00:11:46,217 --> 00:11:47,483
At the bayside club.

239
00:11:47,516 --> 00:11:49,217
But she also did some modeling.

240
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,917
Yeah, she had a job scheduled four days ago

241
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,184
With a photographer named Jonathan Farrow.

242
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:57,217
He's a very big fashion photographer.

243
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,384
That's disgusting. what the fuck...?

244
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:02,417
That is sick.

245
00:12:02,451 --> 00:12:06,050
Even I'm disturbed by this.

246
00:12:06,084 --> 00:12:07,950
Ms. carazo didn't report for work

247
00:12:07,984 --> 00:12:09,717
The night after she was scheduled to see Farrow.

248
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,783
The kicker is, seven years ago Farrow was arrested

249
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:13,284
In new york on suspicion of rape.

250
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,217
The charges were ultimately dropped.

251
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,217
So he's clean?

252
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,583
When I spoke with the lead detective of that case,

253
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:20,451
Uh, he thinks the victim was paid off.

254
00:12:20,483 --> 00:12:22,783
Okay, so he's dirty.

255
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:24,550
The guy's surrounded by a firewall of lawyers.

256
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,217
He's well protected and playing hardball.

257
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,250
Maybe i'll get a turn at bat.

258
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:30,351
Well, he's agreed to come in for questioning this morning

259
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:32,616
But I doubt if we'll get anything out of him.

260
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,284
I'd like to be there. okay.

261
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:35,783
Well thank you, ang-- sgt. batista.

262
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:36,783
Excuse me.

263
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:38,550
You're welcome, Lieuteant.

264
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:46,317
What's with batista and Laguerta?

265
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:47,817
What are you talking about?

266
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,616
They're afraid to look at each other.

267
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,117
Why would that be?

268
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,217
Because they're doing it?

269
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,550
Makes sense.

270
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,650
When you put two people in a room together long enough

271
00:12:57,683 --> 00:12:58,717
Eventually they're gonna fuck.

272
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,817
Oh, wow. that's so romantic.

273
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,550
You should have that tattooed across your fat head.

274
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,883
What?

275
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:10,950
I'll need to find the right activity for astor.

276
00:13:10,984 --> 00:13:14,850
What did I like to do when I was 12?

277
00:13:14,883 --> 00:13:17,351
Okay, then, moving on.

278
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,583
Hi, this is mr. Farrow's assistant, hold please.

279
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:36,783
Uh, no, I'm sorry. mr. Farrow is not available

280
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,317
For any bookings right now.

281
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,351
You have nothing better to do?

282
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:47,351
I wouldn't say Farrow's nothing.

283
00:13:47,384 --> 00:13:49,351
Compared to Trinity, he is.

284
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:52,451
Trinity's not going anywhere.

285
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:53,984
With his kill cycle over

286
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:56,084
He's not a threat to anyone for the time being.

287
00:13:56,117 --> 00:13:58,550
Not sure I could say the same about this guy.

288
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:02,284
I haven't the faintest idea who estrella carazo is.

289
00:14:05,984 --> 00:14:07,717
Oh, yes.

290
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,917
God, she had a nice ass.

291
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,683
I shot her in my studio last thursday

292
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,550
For a jamaican rum campaign.

293
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,184
Nothing sells rum like a nice booty.

294
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:17,317
What time was that?

295
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:20,883
00 a.m. till noon.

296
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,317
Yeah, then I drove down to the keys

297
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:23,417
For another commercial shoot

298
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:24,817
That lasted well into the night.

299
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,384
That can be verified?

300
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:30,150
By my assistant and about a dozen other people.

301
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:31,683
Tell me, Dexter,

302
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:33,384
What's the real reason you're stalling

303
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:35,384
On killing Trinity?

304
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,017
I still have things to learn from him.

305
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,817
I spent my entire life trying to teach you

306
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,917
Not to be like him.

307
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,984
You also taught me

308
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:45,384
I couldn't be with people, I couldn't get married.

309
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,817
You taught me a lot of things I learned were wrong.

310
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,351
You're taking a risk here.

311
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:53,417
Isn't that what life is?

312
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:55,616
A risk?

313
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,117
Any ideas who might have wanted to harm miss carazo?

314
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,451
Look, the girl was gorgeous but she was f.o.j.j.

315
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:04,717
F.o.j.j.?

316
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,550
Fresh off the jumbo jet. yeah.

317
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,084
Very rural, you might say.

318
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:12,717
Sensitive guy...

319
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,950
I like you.

320
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:16,184
I could make you a star.

321
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:18,917
I just need to get you in my studio

322
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,417
Whip your clothes off and rough you up a little bit.

323
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:26,850
I think you just jumped to the top of my list.

324
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:32,150
It's gonna be so nice

325
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:34,516
To finally have my own place again.

326
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,284
Nice apartment.

327
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,817
Yeah, right?

328
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,950
I've wanted it for years.

329
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:48,284
Who's was it?

330
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:51,217
Dexter's.

331
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,284
No shit?

332
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:54,783
How come you're just now getting it?

333
00:15:54,817 --> 00:15:56,783
I mean, he got married, like what, eight months ago?

334
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:59,351
Well, he kind of held on to it for a while.

335
00:15:59,384 --> 00:16:00,850
For what, like his secret fuckpad?

336
00:16:00,883 --> 00:16:04,583
No I think he just has a problem with change.

337
00:16:04,616 --> 00:16:06,250
He's very slow to evolve.

338
00:16:06,284 --> 00:16:09,017
Anyway, I should be going.

339
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,483
Yeah, thanks for the help.

340
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:12,616
I'm not suppose to lift anything for a while.

341
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:20,483
You kept your apartment after you got married?

342
00:16:20,516 --> 00:16:23,516
What kind of guy does that?

343
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,850
What are you hiding, Dexter?

344
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:27,883
Stay out of my life.

345
00:16:33,317 --> 00:16:35,384
I know this is, like, your place now

346
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:38,217
But are you always gonna, like,

347
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,817
Have people here?

348
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,150
Yes, dex, sometimes I'm gonna have people over.

349
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,883
This is, uh, the rest of your stuff from the house.

350
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:55,950
Thanks.

351
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:58,783
I'm picking up right where Lundy left off with Trinity.

352
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,217
I owe him that much, right?

353
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,550
So look...

354
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:07,550
There are over 60 deaths linked to Trinity.

355
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,550
12 different cities, cases leading back to 1979.

356
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,817
I have every little iota of evidence Frank collected

357
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:18,050
Except what was stolen by Trinity.

358
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:19,451
And I'm gonna run it all by Laguerta tomorrow

359
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:21,317
With the kicker...

360
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:26,550
That Trinity shot me and Lundy too.

361
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,683
Wow, that's a lot.

362
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:32,050
Fuck yeah, it's a lot.

363
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,550
Deb's right but it sounds like

364
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,750
Some mad conspiracy theory.

365
00:17:35,783 --> 00:17:36,950
Which is exactly what Laguerta will think

366
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:38,117
When she hears it.

367
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,817
I'm gonna fuckin' blow her away.

368
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:44,717
Are these--

369
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,217
They're dad's old c.i. files.

370
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:56,017
Didn't know you had them.

371
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,683
So you haven't told me how it's going--

372
00:17:57,717 --> 00:17:59,883
Your search.

373
00:17:59,917 --> 00:18:01,417
I finally got some real info

374
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:02,516
On who dad might have been seeing.

375
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,917
My mother, you mean?

376
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,217
I'm having coffee with her tomorrow.

377
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,984
Okay, now I'm confused.

378
00:18:07,017 --> 00:18:08,217
Coffee?

379
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,616
Her name's Valerie hodges.

380
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,117
I left a message for her, like, a month ago,

381
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,050
And she finally called me back.

382
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:14,616
Not my mother.

383
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,616
Debra's headed in the wrong direction.

384
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,550
But when she realizes that and gets headed the right way--

385
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,883
Laura Moser leads to brian Moser,

386
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:25,217
Leads to the ice truck killer, leads to Harry Morgan.

387
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,984
So many little stepping stones

388
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:29,984
That lay a path directly to the real me.

389
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:32,883
Let me know how it goes.

390
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:34,750
I will.

391
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:40,616
Hi, Dexter.

392
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,616
Hi, Dexter. hey.

393
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,750
Hey, sweetie.

394
00:18:42,783 --> 00:18:44,150
Hey, buddy.

395
00:18:44,184 --> 00:18:46,616
Tough day?

396
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,516
Elliot's girlfriend moved out this afternoon.

397
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,850
Oh, that's too bad.

398
00:18:51,883 --> 00:18:53,650
What's too bad?

399
00:18:53,683 --> 00:18:56,417
What's too bad is...

400
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:58,650
That I found all this fun stuff for kids to do today

401
00:18:58,683 --> 00:19:01,616
And I can't do any of it 'cause I'm too big.

402
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,683
Like what?

403
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:04,650
Well, for cody,

404
00:19:04,683 --> 00:19:07,650
I thought he might like to join the young sailors club.

405
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:09,351
Yeah!

406
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:10,650
Wow, that's great.

407
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,184
Elliot's son danny's in that.

408
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,616
I think they have an outing this weekend?

409
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,917
I wanna sail.

410
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,451
Then sail you shall.

411
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:19,351
What about me?

412
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:21,417
How does soccer grab you?

413
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,683
You get to kick things.

414
00:19:23,717 --> 00:19:25,516
No, thanks.

415
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,550
Okay, how about ballet?

416
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,683
Yuck.

417
00:19:28,717 --> 00:19:31,017
Okay.

418
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,351
How about the little scientists association?

419
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:35,717
Why do you hate me so much?

420
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:40,783
We'll keep working on astor.

421
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:42,017
But this is a good idea.

422
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,683
How did you decide to do all this?

423
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,217
Well, I feel it's my responsibility as their father

424
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,516
To help push the kids out into the world.

425
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,483
Make them prepared and self-sufficient.

426
00:19:53,516 --> 00:19:55,317
I'm impressed.

427
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:56,483
Dinner's almost ready.

428
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:59,284
Good, i've got an early-morning meeting.

429
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:18,351
Okay, two serial killers go for a ride...

430
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,417
Why do I get the feeling this joke ends

431
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:22,717
With only one of them coming back?

432
00:20:28,783 --> 00:20:31,017
I've barely skimmed the surface

433
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,850
Of arthur mitchell.

434
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:36,750
Still so much to learn about handling the kids.

435
00:20:36,783 --> 00:20:40,284
The wife...

436
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:43,950
Choose your weapon.

437
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:46,384
Or maybe not.

438
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:49,984
I have plenty of experience with the chainsaw.

439
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:51,950
But it's heavy, difficult to wield,

440
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,217
Has a short reach.

441
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,250
Um, axe.

442
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:18,950
This is a little too into the woods for me.

443
00:21:18,984 --> 00:21:20,917
So what is it we're doing out here?

444
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,483
We're gonna cut down a tree.

445
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:24,117
Oh.

446
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:43,984
God damn it!

447
00:21:44,017 --> 00:21:45,850
Want me to give it a try?

448
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,150
Stand back.

449
00:22:46,284 --> 00:22:49,984
So about the kids,

450
00:22:50,017 --> 00:22:52,417
Uh, one of them doesn't wanna do

451
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:53,883
Any of the things I suggested.

452
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:55,883
So don't make them suggestions.

453
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,583
What do you mean?

454
00:22:58,616 --> 00:23:00,017
They're just children, kyle.

455
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,516
If you let them do whatever they want,

456
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,050
They'd suck their thumbs and diddle themselves all day.

457
00:23:09,717 --> 00:23:10,783
So why did we come out here

458
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:13,284
Instead of just go to the hardware store?

459
00:23:13,317 --> 00:23:15,451
I don't want the lumber in the hardware store.

460
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:16,717
This is better--

461
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,217
Yeah, it's better.

462
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:23,150
Okay, arthur, you're a bit off today.

463
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,583
Uh...

464
00:23:44,616 --> 00:23:46,284
Kyle, I didn't mean to hit it.

465
00:23:49,451 --> 00:23:51,717
Of course not. it was an accident.

466
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,451
Huh, we should go.

467
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:58,650
It's gonna die. it's suffering.

468
00:23:58,683 --> 00:24:01,084
It needs to be put out of its misery, arthur.

469
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,084
You need to kill it.

470
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,917
No, i--i can't.

471
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:18,351
He spent his life killing innocent people,

472
00:24:18,384 --> 00:24:20,483
But he can't kill bambi?

473
00:24:20,516 --> 00:24:24,950
This is your new role model, dex?

474
00:24:24,984 --> 00:24:26,650
It's in pain, arthur.

475
00:24:26,683 --> 00:24:30,817
Please, I can't.

476
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,384
Get that axe from him.

477
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:37,150
Kill him now.

478
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:41,984
Would you like me to kill it?

479
00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:43,184
Would you do that for me?

480
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:53,783
Now, Dexter. kill arthur, now.

481
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:17,017
Man, early mornings with Trinity can be murder.

482
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,050
Lieuteant?

483
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,683
The judge won't issue a search warrant

484
00:25:20,717 --> 00:25:21,683
On Farrow's studio.

485
00:25:21,717 --> 00:25:23,583
No probable cause.

486
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:24,883
Well, that's bad news.

487
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:26,384
Very, cause I'm still sure he's our guy.

488
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,850
I think this means he's my guy.

489
00:25:28,883 --> 00:25:29,984
And this case may be bigger

490
00:25:30,017 --> 00:25:31,150
Than what we originally thought.

491
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:33,050
I've got the names of at least three models

492
00:25:33,084 --> 00:25:35,384
From central and south America

493
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:37,150
Who have all gone missing over the past year.

494
00:25:37,184 --> 00:25:38,683
All here illegally.

495
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:40,150
Now we know that at least one of them

496
00:25:40,184 --> 00:25:41,250
Worked for Farrow.

497
00:25:41,284 --> 00:25:43,050
I figure he picks his victims

498
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:45,217
Knowing that once they've disappeared,

499
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,284
Their families have no way

500
00:25:46,317 --> 00:25:47,683
Of getting an investigation started.

501
00:25:47,717 --> 00:25:49,883
And I can't get a search warrant on this come mierda.

502
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:52,050
Fortunately, unlike batista,

503
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,516
I don't need a search warrant.

504
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,417
Keep working it. find another way in.

505
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,084
Can I ask you something?

506
00:26:05,117 --> 00:26:06,417
Off the record.

507
00:26:06,451 --> 00:26:08,250
Go for it.

508
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:10,351
Is it true that you and batista

509
00:26:10,384 --> 00:26:12,284
Are in some kind of relationship?

510
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:16,184
Excuse me, detective?

511
00:26:16,217 --> 00:26:17,950
It's just that there's a rumor going around--

512
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,117
Then please stop spreading it.

513
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,583
As a fellow woman in the largely male work force,

514
00:26:22,616 --> 00:26:24,084
I'd think you'd have a little more sensitivity

515
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:26,084
To this kind of situation.

516
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:30,284
Sgt. batista and I are co-workers and friends.

517
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:35,917
Shit.

518
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,150
Farrow has a reputation for partying

519
00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:41,150
Late into the night.

520
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:43,616
And tonight should be no different.

521
00:26:52,117 --> 00:26:55,850
Farrow's trusty assistant closing up shop.

522
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:57,984
Right on schedule.

523
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:10,750
Estrella carazo,

524
00:28:10,783 --> 00:28:13,284
Are those tears for real?

525
00:28:33,817 --> 00:28:36,284
I know you like to create images of violence,

526
00:28:36,317 --> 00:28:38,117
But this isn't fake blood I'm seeing.

527
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,650
Someone was hit right here...

528
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,150
Managed to make it this far

529
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:51,084
Before she was...

530
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:54,883
Hit again.

531
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:58,017
And then here...

532
00:29:02,516 --> 00:29:05,050
A fingernail.

533
00:29:15,717 --> 00:29:18,683
Not exactly cinderella's glass slipper.

534
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:20,451
But it is a fit.

535
00:29:49,717 --> 00:29:51,750
Valerie? that would be me.

536
00:29:51,783 --> 00:29:53,317
Debra Morgan. I figured.

537
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:54,351
Sit down.

538
00:29:54,384 --> 00:29:55,451
I left you messages weeks ago.

539
00:29:55,483 --> 00:29:56,750
I figured you weren't gonna call.

540
00:29:56,783 --> 00:29:58,883
Well, I was on a cruise.

541
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:01,583
Rich old men love to spend money on me.

542
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:06,317
Um, so you use to work for my dad, Harry Morgan?

543
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:07,317
I did.

544
00:30:07,351 --> 00:30:09,317
I still have my sources,

545
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:10,583
If that's what you're wondering.

546
00:30:10,616 --> 00:30:12,150
Pick up where we left off.

547
00:30:12,184 --> 00:30:14,917
Of course, my fee's gonna be a little higher now.

548
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,616
No, actually, I just wanted to ask you about my dad.

549
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:23,783
Did you and my father...

550
00:30:23,817 --> 00:30:28,351
Did you ever have a romantic relationship?

551
00:30:28,384 --> 00:30:30,317
Oh, um,

552
00:30:30,351 --> 00:30:34,650
I'm not sure romantic is the right word.

553
00:30:34,683 --> 00:30:36,317
I was one of his girlfriends,

554
00:30:36,351 --> 00:30:38,883
If that's what you're asking.

555
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:41,184
There were others?

556
00:30:41,217 --> 00:30:43,217
I think he picked the c.i.s

557
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:48,783
Based on how good we were in the sack.

558
00:30:48,817 --> 00:30:52,817
I'm sorry--that's just...

559
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,384
That's just not the picture I have of my dad.

560
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:56,883
Oh...

561
00:30:56,917 --> 00:31:00,583
Hey, I knew he was a hound when I met him,

562
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:03,417
We all did.

563
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:05,050
I was one of his favorites though.

564
00:31:05,084 --> 00:31:08,850
I use to drive him crazy with this one thing--

565
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:12,184
That's enough-- that's enough.

566
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:13,384
Thank you.

567
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:14,817
Thanks.

568
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,217
Does this mean you're not gonna hire me?

569
00:31:21,683 --> 00:31:23,883
I should have listened to everybody.

570
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:25,717
It was a huge mistake to look into dad's past.

571
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,717
What happened?

572
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,217
It's too much.

573
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,883
I don't need to know all this stuff.

574
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:31,217
What stuff?

575
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,184
Dad was fucking Valerie hodges.

576
00:31:34,217 --> 00:31:36,284
Really?

577
00:31:36,317 --> 00:31:39,117
But apparently she was just one of many.

578
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,451
It's every father's nightmare...

579
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,917
Disappointing his children.

580
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,184
That doesn't sound like Harry.

581
00:31:45,217 --> 00:31:46,516
Thank you, dex.

582
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,084
I don't even know who Harry is anymore.

583
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:52,984
He's still everything you remember him to be.

584
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:55,150
Is he?

585
00:31:55,184 --> 00:31:58,451
We all have secrets, Deb.

586
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:01,917
Some of them shouldn't be found out.

587
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,750
I don't have any secrets like that.

588
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,984
No, me neither.

589
00:32:10,017 --> 00:32:11,550
I should just leave it alone.

590
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:13,917
My mother...

591
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:17,384
Yeah, I think that's probably for the best.

592
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:18,817
I'm gonna turn these in and be done with it.

593
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,483
No, you don't have to. i'll do it.

594
00:32:21,516 --> 00:32:22,750
-thanks.

595
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,284
You need to destroy that file, Dexter.

596
00:32:34,317 --> 00:32:35,783
Close that door forever.

597
00:32:59,117 --> 00:33:01,616
I can't let her be cut up again.

598
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:15,850
Hey, sweetie. hey.

599
00:33:15,883 --> 00:33:17,550
Not another gift.

600
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:19,017
No, it's not a gift.

601
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:23,650
It's a push, remember?

602
00:33:23,683 --> 00:33:24,817
What's that for?

603
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,317
It's for you. it's your new guitar.

604
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:28,683
Why?

605
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:30,217
'cause you're gonna take guitar lessons.

606
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,550
Says who?

607
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:34,550
Me.

608
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:37,950
We'll see.

609
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,783
I learned a long time ago you can't force them

610
00:33:41,817 --> 00:33:44,883
To do things they don't wanna do.

611
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:46,583
Yeah, I guess.

612
00:33:46,616 --> 00:33:50,583
So are you ready for your big weekend?

613
00:33:50,616 --> 00:33:52,150
What big weekend?

614
00:33:52,184 --> 00:33:55,583
The overnight camping trip with the young sailors.

615
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,583
I'm not a young sailor, cody is.

616
00:33:57,616 --> 00:34:00,317
I'm a 30-something sailor.

617
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:02,384
But you have to go with him. that's part of the deal.

618
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,184
They need adults with boats.

619
00:34:04,217 --> 00:34:06,583
You're signed up to take four of the boys.

620
00:34:06,616 --> 00:34:08,917
I didn't realize that.

621
00:34:14,616 --> 00:34:16,583
I didn't know I'd have to get so involved.

622
00:34:16,616 --> 00:34:19,017
This isn't a good weekend for me.

623
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,616
Dexter, what do you have to do

624
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,250
That's so important?

625
00:34:22,284 --> 00:34:24,616
Stuff.

626
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,917
Stuff? stuff.

627
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,616
You can't cancel because of stuff.

628
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,616
Cody will be so disappointed.

629
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,217
Well, what time do we have to leave in the morning?

630
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,683
00 a.m.

631
00:34:37,717 --> 00:34:40,217
If I can't do Farrow tomorrow, i'll do him tonight.

632
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,017
Everything's ready.

633
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:45,250
Where are you going?

634
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:47,217
I gotta prep the boat.

635
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,017
If we're camping out, we'll need a tent,

636
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:51,483
Sleeping bags, food, water.

637
00:34:51,516 --> 00:34:54,084
I gotta get two children's life vests.

638
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:56,084
Abduct Jonathan Farrow take him back to his studio,

639
00:34:56,117 --> 00:34:58,650
Kill him, cut him to pieces, dump him in the ocean.

640
00:34:58,683 --> 00:35:02,550
Honestly, rita, this is gonna take me a while.

641
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:04,050
Do you need some help?

642
00:35:04,084 --> 00:35:05,650
No, I got it.

643
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:09,150
This really means a lot to cody.

644
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,750
Me too.

645
00:35:16,184 --> 00:35:18,950
And suddenly...

646
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:20,917
Tonight's the night.

647
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,351
Jonathan Farrow, party animal.

648
00:35:24,384 --> 00:35:27,783
Okay, Jonathan, party like there's no tomorrow.

649
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,783
I'm on mr. Farrow's list.

650
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,217
I don't have all night.

651
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,451
Neither does Jonathan Farrow.

652
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,250
Excuse me, could you tell mr. Farrow

653
00:36:28,284 --> 00:36:29,817
I just saw a homeless guy throwing up

654
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,817
In the back seat of his car?

655
00:36:57,351 --> 00:36:58,750
Quinn?

656
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,417
What is he doing here?

657
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,184
It couldn't be coincidence.

658
00:37:02,217 --> 00:37:04,883
This whole thing just became too risky.

659
00:37:08,117 --> 00:37:11,917
Can you believe he's here?

660
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,750
Uh, who is he?

661
00:37:13,783 --> 00:37:16,184
That's quinn.

662
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:18,250
I've never heard of him.

663
00:37:18,284 --> 00:37:20,284
You'd be making a big mistake.

664
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,783
Hello.

665
00:37:37,817 --> 00:37:39,583
Hello yourself.

666
00:37:39,616 --> 00:37:40,783
You must be quinn?

667
00:37:40,817 --> 00:37:42,284
I am.

668
00:37:46,616 --> 00:37:48,650
This lab geek just fucking ditch me?

669
00:37:52,284 --> 00:37:55,317
Okay, tonight's not the night.

670
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:57,384
Guess I'm prepping the boat to go camping after all.

671
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:25,616
The biscayne bay, boys!

672
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:30,150
Home of the seminole indians, the spanish conquistadors,

673
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:31,516
Cutthroat pirates...

674
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,917
And now Dexter Morgan and four skinny boys.

675
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,917
Harry used to take me camping.

676
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,317
If I can't kill Jonathan Farrow tonight,

677
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,650
At least I can make the most of my time with cody.

678
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,817
See, you just pull it tight, like that,

679
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,250
And that's your bowline.

680
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:50,050
That's my personal favorite.

681
00:39:50,084 --> 00:39:51,384
You might prefer a taut-line hitch, though.

682
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:52,683
I'll show you on the other side.

683
00:39:52,717 --> 00:39:53,917
Or maybe you wanna see a trucker's hitch

684
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,017
That's a fun one.

685
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,351
Dexter?

686
00:39:56,384 --> 00:39:57,616
What?

687
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,917
Can I throw dirt clods?

688
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,284
Oh, okay.

689
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,750
You forgot the rope.

690
00:40:05,783 --> 00:40:06,984
Right...

691
00:40:10,917 --> 00:40:12,084
You seem a little distracted.

692
00:40:12,117 --> 00:40:14,084
Yeah, well, arthur's technique

693
00:40:14,117 --> 00:40:16,317
Of keeping the kids busy and therefore keeping me free

694
00:40:16,351 --> 00:40:17,583
Isn't working out like it was supposed to.

695
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:20,250
So maybe it's time to kill him.

696
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,950
After Farrow.

697
00:40:47,717 --> 00:40:48,950
Hey.

698
00:40:48,984 --> 00:40:51,616
I just got the official go ahead from Laguerta

699
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,084
To open a Trinity killer investigation.

700
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:57,317
Really?

701
00:40:57,351 --> 00:41:00,483
She went for the whole...

702
00:41:00,516 --> 00:41:02,284
Serial killer thing?

703
00:41:02,317 --> 00:41:05,616
Okay, let's call it a limited Trinity investigation.

704
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,917
What's that mean?

705
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,150
Right before I went in,

706
00:41:08,184 --> 00:41:10,017
I realized if I pitched the entire Trinity theory

707
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,750
And I added that he also shot me and Lundy,

708
00:41:13,783 --> 00:41:14,950
I'd look like a fucking lunatic.

709
00:41:14,984 --> 00:41:17,750
So I boiled it down to the bare essentials.

710
00:41:17,783 --> 00:41:19,084
Which are?

711
00:41:19,117 --> 00:41:20,417
The bludgeonings.

712
00:41:20,451 --> 00:41:21,451
They still go back 30 years.

713
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:23,050
So I can investigate Trinity

714
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:26,184
Without Laguerta knowing I'm investigating Trinity.

715
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,250
Smart.

716
00:41:28,284 --> 00:41:31,050
What's the next step?

717
00:41:31,084 --> 00:41:33,050
I don't know.

718
00:41:33,084 --> 00:41:34,284
I don't know, but what I do know

719
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:36,050
Is that Trinity killed Frank.

720
00:41:36,084 --> 00:41:38,084
And I'm gonna catch him.

721
00:41:38,117 --> 00:41:40,384
I'm sure you will.

722
00:41:46,483 --> 00:41:47,984
So sarge.

723
00:41:48,017 --> 00:41:49,783
What's this about you and Laguerta?

724
00:41:49,817 --> 00:41:52,483
A little bump and grind?

725
00:41:52,516 --> 00:41:55,783
Do not talk about Lieuteant Laguerta that way.

726
00:41:55,817 --> 00:41:57,117
Comprende?

727
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,817
Wow, I'm sorry.

728
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:04,117
You must really dig her.

729
00:42:11,783 --> 00:42:13,217
Angel.

730
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,583
Quinn just asked me

731
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:18,850
If you and I were bumping and grinding.

732
00:42:18,883 --> 00:42:21,550
Debra Morgan asked me the same thing.

733
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,150
Well, not in those words.

734
00:42:23,184 --> 00:42:24,550
Where are they getting this from?

735
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,750
I don't know.

736
00:42:25,783 --> 00:42:27,017
It's you.

737
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,850
The way you keep looking at me.

738
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:32,917
Everywhere I go you're staring at my culo.

739
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,117
Okay, that is so not true.

740
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,284
It is too.

741
00:42:36,317 --> 00:42:38,984
Now I know...

742
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:41,984
That I have a pretty nice ass,

743
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,516
But you gotta stop.

744
00:42:48,217 --> 00:42:53,150
I miss you, angel.

745
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:56,950
I miss you too.

746
00:42:56,984 --> 00:42:58,683
But we made our choice.

747
00:42:58,717 --> 00:43:00,883
Yeah, yeah.

748
00:43:08,017 --> 00:43:10,184
When all of a sudden...

749
00:43:10,217 --> 00:43:14,150
They heard a scratching noise on the roof of the car.

750
00:43:17,984 --> 00:43:19,184
What was that?

751
00:43:19,217 --> 00:43:21,650
And they thought, "let's get out of here."

752
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:23,717
So they drove home as fast as they could.

753
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,384
And when they got home,

754
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:27,917
He went around to open the car door

755
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,783
For his girlfriend

756
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:32,917
And there hanging from the handle,

757
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:35,451
A bloody hook!

758
00:43:39,616 --> 00:43:42,017
That doesn't even make sense.

759
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,516
Your turn, Dexter.

760
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:48,084
Uh, actually, I don't know any scary stories.

761
00:43:48,117 --> 00:43:50,284
Oh, come on. give it a shot.

762
00:43:52,417 --> 00:43:56,917
All right.

763
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:02,483
There's a man.

764
00:44:02,516 --> 00:44:04,883
You can call him the man of three.

765
00:44:04,917 --> 00:44:09,917
You can call him Trinity.

766
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,250
You can call him anything you want

767
00:44:11,284 --> 00:44:12,917
But the fact is he's not a man at all.

768
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:16,217
He's a monster.

769
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:21,250
He was born in a bathtub filled with blood.

770
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:23,950
For countless years he's roamed the countryside

771
00:44:23,984 --> 00:44:27,317
Killing the innocent, leaving behind

772
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:31,783
Bits of his dead sister.

773
00:44:31,817 --> 00:44:36,084
Sometimes he'll sneak up on a man

774
00:44:36,117 --> 00:44:39,950
And raise his hammer overhead,

775
00:44:39,984 --> 00:44:41,417
And then he'll swing it down--

776
00:44:41,451 --> 00:44:44,516
And smash his own thumb and then go crying all the way home,

777
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,150
Like a little baby.

778
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,317
That's what happens.

779
00:44:50,351 --> 00:44:52,883
That was funny. thanks...

780
00:44:52,917 --> 00:44:55,550
And now I think it's time to hit the sleeping bags.

781
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:58,550
You guys are beat. you've had a huge day.

782
00:45:22,284 --> 00:45:23,384
Hey, buddy.

783
00:45:23,417 --> 00:45:25,317
You need anything?

784
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:26,317
I'm good.

785
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:29,351
Do you need anything?

786
00:45:29,384 --> 00:45:31,084
No, I'm good too.

787
00:45:45,217 --> 00:45:48,084
00...

788
00:45:48,117 --> 00:45:49,984
The kids won't wake up till it's light out.

789
00:45:50,017 --> 00:45:52,850
Plenty of time for me.

790
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:10,650
What the hell is going on-- what is this?

791
00:47:10,683 --> 00:47:13,683
This...

792
00:47:13,717 --> 00:47:15,783
Is the decisive moment.

793
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:21,483
What's the name of the photographer

794
00:47:21,516 --> 00:47:24,850
Who always talked about that?

795
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:29,683
Cartier-bresson. right--right.

796
00:47:29,717 --> 00:47:32,516
Once you miss it it's gone forever.

797
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,616
A perfect moment...

798
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:36,917
Frozen in time.

799
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:39,451
Something like that, right?

800
00:47:39,483 --> 00:47:40,616
Yes, but--

801
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:45,550
Ow, fuck, fuck, fuck!

802
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:48,717
Who are you?

803
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,351
I'm the person who's going to to keep you

804
00:47:50,384 --> 00:47:53,050
From killing any more women.

805
00:47:53,084 --> 00:47:54,984
What?

806
00:47:55,017 --> 00:47:57,184
I've never killed anyone.

807
00:47:57,217 --> 00:48:01,284
You killed Estrella Carazo.

808
00:48:01,317 --> 00:48:03,117
Who knows how many others...

809
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:06,117
I didn't fucking kill them!

810
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,516
I photographed them!

811
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:08,717
It's too fucking bad they're dead but i--

812
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,150
Too fucking bad they're dead.

813
00:48:11,184 --> 00:48:16,184
Life is hard, and it's brutal and ugly,

814
00:48:16,217 --> 00:48:18,850
And way too fucking short.

815
00:48:18,883 --> 00:48:22,351
That's why I shoot what I do, beautiful women.

816
00:48:22,384 --> 00:48:25,550
Who are bruised and cut and bleeding.

817
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:26,717
Oh, fuck...

818
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:30,451
It's for the contrast!

819
00:48:30,483 --> 00:48:31,817
You add a little bit of the real world

820
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:33,850
It makes them all the more beautiful.

821
00:48:33,883 --> 00:48:39,250
Until you kill them.

822
00:48:39,284 --> 00:48:41,017
If they could thank me, they fucking would.

823
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,084
Because of my pictures,

824
00:48:42,117 --> 00:48:44,050
Those women will live on forever!

825
00:48:44,084 --> 00:48:46,417
Nothing lasts forever.

826
00:49:02,717 --> 00:49:05,050
Man has always been drawn to the sea.

827
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:12,451
But it's an unnatural setting for us.

828
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:14,117
A place of great danger.

829
00:49:24,184 --> 00:49:28,783
Tides, currents, waves, wind...

830
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:31,883
Each presenting their own hazards.

831
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:35,516
None of which can be ignored.

832
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,883
The slightest lapse of judgment

833
00:49:42,917 --> 00:49:46,317
Can be a mistake you might never recover from.

834
00:49:49,817 --> 00:49:51,783
But a good sailor doesn't fight

835
00:49:51,817 --> 00:49:54,451
Against these elements.

836
00:50:04,883 --> 00:50:07,084
A good sailor works with them,

837
00:50:07,117 --> 00:50:09,351
Using them to his advantage.

838
00:50:09,384 --> 00:50:13,417
While others less fortunate might be forever cast adrift,

839
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:16,117
Often in several pieces.

840
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:19,150
He always comes home safely.

841
00:50:39,184 --> 00:50:41,550
What the hell?

842
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:46,850
Isn't that--

843
00:50:46,883 --> 00:50:48,317
Farrow's assistant.

844
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:49,616
I just arrested him for the murder

845
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:52,217
Of estrella carazo.

846
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,284
But, no, I thought--

847
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:54,550
Yeah, at first it looked like Farrow,

848
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:55,717
But this is airtight.

849
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,984
We got camera footage from the tollbooth

850
00:50:58,017 --> 00:51:00,184
Of him heading over to alligator alley.

851
00:51:00,217 --> 00:51:02,284
We got dna evidence. we got everything.

852
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,650
I killed an innocent man.
