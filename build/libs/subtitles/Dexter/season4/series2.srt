1
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:47,392
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

2
00:01:47,443 --> 00:01:48,726
Dexter Morgan.

3
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:50,311
Good suburban husband.

4
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:52,447
Happy father of three.

5
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:54,032
Living the dream.

6
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:55,783
Want to know a secret?

7
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:59,353
Daddy kills people.

8
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:02,123
- I'm halfway through the
C.I. files you gave me.

9
00:02:02,157 --> 00:02:06,027
Maybe then I'll finally get some answers.

10
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:07,495
Tell me again this isn't crazy.

11
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:10,465
Crazy good.

12
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:12,667
Some guy on his honeymoon
took a shot in the head.

13
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:13,751
Grave condition.

14
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:15,369
They're pulling the plug tomorrow.

15
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:17,055
- Last thing our city needs
is dead tourists.

16
00:02:17,089 --> 00:02:19,040
Brought you a copy of my article.

17
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:21,542
My editor okayed a follow-up.
You got anything for me?

18
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,062
I'd love to take you
out for a drink.

19
00:02:24,096 --> 00:02:26,097
Let's make it dinner.

20
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:31,552
Dexter.

21
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,738
How's my favorite serial-killer hunter?

22
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:35,406
Are you here on a case?

23
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:37,742
Actually I'm retired now.

24
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:39,160
Now I have the time to track down

25
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:42,196
the one twisted son of a bitch
who got away.

26
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,200
So who is the twisted son of a bitch?

27
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:48,920
I call him the Trinity killer.

28
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:50,121
Kills in threes.

29
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:52,423
Been doing it all over
the country for years.

30
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,759
Trinity's in Miami, Dexter,

31
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:56,878
Starting his cycle all over again.

32
00:02:56,912 --> 00:03:00,682
- Vicky Noonan, 22,
found in the bathtub.

33
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:02,583
1979?

34
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:04,102
But this is the Gomez hearing.

35
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:05,920
Yes, Mr. Morgan.

36
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:08,255
The defendent's name is Benito Gomez.

37
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:09,557
I must have brought the wrong notes.

38
00:03:09,591 --> 00:03:11,693
Wrong notes, wrong blood type,

39
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:12,894
Wrong case.

40
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:14,261
That's what you call a momentary mix-up

41
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,396
in a murder trial?

42
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,614
That asshole you let walk?

43
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:18,066
Benito Gomez.

44
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,284
- Ahh!
Now you get it right.

45
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,153
Quinn's legwork may have shown me

46
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:23,705
where to find our friend,

47
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:25,206
But this, Benny,

48
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,576
My bloodwork is the stuff
that seals your fate.

49
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,777
Fuck you want?

50
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:31,779
You.

51
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:33,781
Shutdown for decades way out of town.

52
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,217
A fitting place for a punk
like Benny Gomez

53
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:39,253
to go down for the count.

54
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:48,262
Tonight's the night I finally...

55
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:49,480
Sleep.

56
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,664
- Hang in there, buddy.
We got you.

57
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:51,358
Do you know where you are?

58
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:52,743
- Ambulance.
What happened?

59
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:54,361
You were in an accident.

60
00:04:56,498 --> 00:04:59,500
Benny. Benny. Benny.

61
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:17,068
Sir, we found something in your car.

62
00:05:17,102 --> 00:05:19,687
Benny Gomez is in there.

63
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:20,738
You're okay.

64
00:05:20,772 --> 00:05:23,858
A bag.

65
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:25,993
Says "pediatric" on it.

66
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:30,581
Thought you might need
to take it with you.

67
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:32,116
Where are they taking my car?

68
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,168
- Just relax.
They'll take care of it.

69
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:36,704
I have no idea where it's going.

70
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:38,089
If someone-

71
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:42,210
<i>When someone finds what's in back...</i>

72
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:43,577
It's never as bad as it looks.

73
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:45,713
Oh, I'm pretty sure this is worse.

74
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:54,555
What's your name?

75
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,423
Dexter Morgan.

76
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:58,142
You know who the President is?

77
00:05:58,193 --> 00:06:00,394
Barack Obama.

78
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:02,363
Your pupils are dilating normally,

79
00:06:02,397 --> 00:06:04,431
which is the good news.

80
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,784
Bad news is that you've
sustained a concussion.

81
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:11,622
What's the last thing you remember?

82
00:06:11,657 --> 00:06:14,492
Working late.

83
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:16,661
My wife...

84
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:18,963
Asked me to pick up some
medicine for our son.

85
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:20,915
He's been sick.

86
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,216
I haven't been sleeping well.

87
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,784
I must have dozed off at the wheel.

88
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:25,169
So you don't remember the accident?

89
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,004
No.

90
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:28,956
I don't even remember
getting in the car.

91
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,958
Short-term memory loss is common

92
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,476
for this type of injury.

93
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:34,512
Can also effect your judgment,
cause confusion,

94
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:35,963
Disorientation.

95
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:38,065
- I just need a good
night's sleep, I think.

96
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,767
Not for the next 12 hours.

97
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:41,435
Any type of head trauma, we want

98
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:42,904
to keep the patient awake.

99
00:06:42,938 --> 00:06:44,605
I'd like to keep you here for observation.

100
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,806
Not an option.

101
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:47,024
Mmm.

102
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:48,242
My wife's a registered nurse.

103
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:49,443
She'll keep an eye on me.

104
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:51,312
- You got whacked pretty
good, Mr. Morgan.

105
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,613
You need to be monitored.

106
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:54,198
I'll get your admission
paperwork going.

107
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:56,250
Be right back.

108
00:06:59,671 --> 00:07:01,005
Dexter!

109
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,373
Oh, my God!

110
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:03,591
Are you all right?

111
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,675
I'm fine.

112
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,993
It's just a little fender bender.

113
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:07,678
- The nurse said they brought
you in an ambulance.

114
00:07:07,713 --> 00:07:08,879
An ambulance, Dexter.

115
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,381
No, it's just a liability thing.

116
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:12,216
Doc says I'm good to go.

117
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:14,685
I raced over here.

118
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,770
Look at me.

119
00:07:15,804 --> 00:07:18,055
I'm wearing two different shoes.

120
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:19,673
Sure you're okay?

121
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:20,674
You look so pale.

122
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:22,343
Hospitals.

123
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:24,528
They give me the creeps, which is why

124
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:25,813
I want to get out of here.

125
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:30,234
I was so scared.

126
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:32,903
It's okay. I'm fine.

127
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:34,155
Come on.

128
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,522
Let's go.

129
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,025
I got to get ready for work.

130
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:41,078
Aspirin, caffeine, whatever it takes.

131
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:43,164
If I fall asleep, it's over.

132
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:44,799
And I'm not talking concussion.

133
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,219
If they find Benny in my car,
it's lethal injection time.

134
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:52,206
- Cody, you butt-breath,
stay away from my stuff!

135
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:54,258
- If ever there was a reason
to take a personal day,

136
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:55,426
this is it.

137
00:07:55,477 --> 00:07:56,978
I'm okay.

138
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:58,896
But I love having someone
to worry about me.

139
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,317
- Good, 'cause that's
exactly what I'm doing.

140
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:04,735
Who else needs a kiss?

141
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,220
I'm good.

142
00:08:06,238 --> 00:08:09,190
How about a hug?

143
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:10,358
Oh!

144
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:12,026
What's the matter?

145
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,862
- Uh, just a little sore
from the accident still.

146
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:16,864
You got in an accident?

147
00:08:16,898 --> 00:08:18,199
Anyone die?

148
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:19,834
Just a little fender bender.

149
00:08:19,868 --> 00:08:21,902
No one died.

150
00:08:23,538 --> 00:08:24,922
There's my cab.

151
00:08:24,956 --> 00:08:26,424
Dexter, why can't you just call in?

152
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,459
- And what?
Take a vacation day?

153
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,878
I'd rather do that when we can
all go to Disneyworld.

154
00:08:30,912 --> 00:08:33,464
Disneyworld!

155
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:35,933
I'm fine.

156
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:39,103
I got to go to work.

157
00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:41,222
And I need one slow day at the job

158
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:42,756
where nobody gets murdered.

159
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:45,226
I already have a killer
to clean up after.

160
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,095
Me.

161
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:49,697
<i>- Hay cafe con leche
in the kitchen.</i>

162
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:51,115
I'll grab some at work.

163
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:54,035
Got to make sure to get there
before you do.

164
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:57,121
Don't want to arouse suspicion.

165
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:59,623
Mmm.

166
00:08:59,658 --> 00:09:04,611
Speaking of arousing...

167
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:07,832
- You keep this up,
there goes your head start.

168
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:12,586
What if we showed up together, hmm?

169
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,589
What's the worst that could happen?

170
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:20,511
Better get to the station.

171
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:23,347
Yeah, I should get in the shower.

172
00:09:23,398 --> 00:09:25,066
You've got a ten-minute head start.

173
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,517
Make it 20 just to be safe.

174
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:28,936
You should...

175
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,139
Leave your hair down.

176
00:09:32,157 --> 00:09:34,141
It's beautiful.

177
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:43,451
Yes, Ray's tow yard, 15th, right?

178
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,825
Dexter?

179
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:53,294
Car trouble?

180
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:55,262
I- Little accident.

181
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:57,164
It's my fault.
I'm a knucklehead.

182
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:58,382
You got a minute?

183
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:03,387
I'd like to pick your brain.

184
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:05,773
I need to get over to the motor pool

185
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:07,525
before they run out
of loaners or something.

186
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,642
I need to pick up.

187
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:11,011
- Not a problem.
I'll walk with you.

188
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,898
- Uh...
Yeah, I do have a minute.

189
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:16,450
- Just want to follow up on that
Crime Scene Investigation

190
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:18,819
from the other day.

191
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:21,688
Lisa Bell?

192
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:23,457
The girl in the bathtub.

193
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,543
- Right!
Uh... of course.

194
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:27,661
The Trinity killer's
most recent victim.

195
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,798
If my theory holds.

196
00:10:30,832 --> 00:10:32,166
You sure you're okay?

197
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,885
- I'm just, uh, tired.
Long night.

198
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,971
What can I tell you about Lisa Bell?

199
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:38,589
You run across any hair or fiber

200
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,224
in that second blood sample you found?

201
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:42,426
Nothing yet.

202
00:10:42,477 --> 00:10:45,429
Really is kismet, you know?

203
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,398
Kismet?

204
00:10:47,432 --> 00:10:48,732
Fate.

205
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:50,384
I mean, if Trinity had
struck in Buffalo

206
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:52,820
instead of Miami,
I wouldn't have access

207
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:54,572
to a blood guy of your caliber.

208
00:10:54,606 --> 00:10:57,775
Well, thanks... for that.

209
00:10:57,826 --> 00:10:59,410
But the person that you should
really be talking to

210
00:10:59,444 --> 00:11:00,411
is my sister.

211
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:01,445
She's lead on Lisa Bell.

212
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:02,896
See?

213
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:05,232
Already putting good ideas
in my head.

214
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,750
Kismet.

215
00:11:10,422 --> 00:11:11,672
More like self-preservation.

216
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:14,291
Last thing I need right now
is Frank Lundy,

217
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:16,510
Rock Star FBI profiler,

218
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:18,262
standing between me and Benny Gomez.

219
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:14,235
No crime scene tape,
no coroner's van.

220
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:18,272
That bodes well.

221
00:12:18,306 --> 00:12:21,308
Unless S.W.A.T.'s lying
in wait for me.

222
00:12:25,163 --> 00:12:27,147
Ah!

223
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:30,668
The bag's still there.

224
00:12:30,702 --> 00:12:32,286
<i>Wait, a bag.</i>

225
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,255
Not the six it takes to hold a body.

226
00:12:38,677 --> 00:12:40,594
My kill tools.

227
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,329
If they're here and Benny isn't,

228
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:44,515
He must have been thrown
from the car.

229
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:49,853
I have to get to the crash site.

230
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:57,111
Shit!

231
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:58,479
Morgan.

232
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:00,698
Dexter, I need you at a Crime scene.

233
00:13:00,732 --> 00:13:01,865
Someone found the body.

234
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,518
Oh, you make it sound so easy.

235
00:13:04,536 --> 00:13:06,153
Vizcaya Reef Hotel.

236
00:13:06,187 --> 00:13:08,372
Just one murder-free day, Miami.

237
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:09,573
That's all I asked for.

238
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:11,041
On my way.

239
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:12,826
Okay, I need you there A.S.A.P.

240
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,128
This is high priority.

241
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:19,416
- One stop first.
Higher priority.

242
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:22,670
If that one stop doesn't
give me Benny Gomez,

243
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:25,506
I'll be running out of options.

244
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,890
All right, let's get moving.

245
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:28,592
Yale, Soderquist,
Morgan, Quinn...

246
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:30,894
- Sarge, I'm working a lead
on the Lisa Bell case.

247
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:32,096
- I have to-
- Where the hell's Quinn?

248
00:13:32,147 --> 00:13:33,714
Here. I'm here.

249
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:35,649
Not for long.

250
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:37,768
Another tourist caught a bullet.

251
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:39,403
You do what you have
to do with the Bell case,

252
00:13:39,437 --> 00:13:40,571
but check in,
we may need you at the hotel.

253
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:41,772
Okay.

254
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:42,906
- You came up with something
on our case?

255
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:43,991
- Yeah.
Yeah.

256
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:45,192
While you were looking for your panties

257
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:47,894
on some chickie-do's floor.

258
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:50,030
Frances, hey, Deb.

259
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:51,565
Were you able to pull anything up

260
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,067
on that 30-year-old homicide
I was asking you about?

261
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:56,086
Perp's name's Eddie Noonan.

262
00:13:56,121 --> 00:13:57,838
Great.
Can you bring it up?

263
00:13:57,872 --> 00:14:00,374
Thanks.

264
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:02,960
My keen forensic sense of smell

265
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,795
tells me you're wearing a perfume.

266
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:07,247
Anything to do with the return

267
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:10,801
of one Special Agent Frank Lundy?

268
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:12,252
I already have a boyfriend

269
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,304
who happens to be coming back
in town tonight.

270
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:17,725
And if you smell me again,
I'll punch you in the throat.

271
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,564
- So much for keeping these
shootings low profile.

272
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:25,315
"A string of robberies turned deadly

273
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:26,767
"in what authorities are now calling

274
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:28,101
'the vacation murder'."

275
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:29,453
Imagine how thrilled the Mayor is

276
00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:30,988
This thing had a brand name.

277
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:33,374
- Wait till he hears it's
"vacations murders," plural.

278
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:34,742
Jesus.

279
00:14:34,776 --> 00:14:39,380
Does anyone know this Christine Hill?

280
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:42,299
We might have met a few times.

281
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,001
- Well, see if you can get her
to tone down

282
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:45,169
The creative writing, okay?

283
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,504
I'm gonna need an arrest here soon.

284
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:48,589
Don't worry, I'm on it.

285
00:14:48,623 --> 00:14:50,057
Actually, I'm on it.

286
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:54,678
I told the Mayor
I'd take the lead on this case.

287
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:55,929
Okay.

288
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:57,314
No reflection on you, Sergeant.

289
00:14:57,348 --> 00:15:01,902
It's your call, Lieutenant.

290
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:03,821
You are so boning this reporter.

291
00:15:03,855 --> 00:15:05,572
Shut the fuck up.

292
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:07,858
<i>- Guys, vamonos,
we got a crime to solve.</i>

293
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:22,539
You here to lend a hand?

294
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,991
More like find one.

295
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:27,094
If those body parts were
thrown from the car,

296
00:15:27,128 --> 00:15:28,295
Locating them is a matter of-

297
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:32,049
-velocity and trajectory.

298
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,052
Should be right around here.

299
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:43,360
Just imagine if Harrison had been-

300
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:44,511
He wasn't.

301
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:46,363
- If your ritual
hadn't been interrupted

302
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:47,948
to go pick up meds for Harrison...

303
00:15:47,982 --> 00:15:49,983
You saying he's to blame for this?

304
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:53,954
<i>I'm not.</i>

305
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,193
Dizzy?

306
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:03,363
I'm fine.

307
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:05,365
Unless you can't find Benny Gomez.

308
00:16:05,383 --> 00:16:09,670
Those bags aren't here, Dexter.

309
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:11,221
What did you do with his body?

310
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:14,875
Rita called about Harrison and...

311
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:18,562
Everything else is just fog.

312
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:21,047
- Come on, Dex.
Think.

313
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,522
Where is Benny?

314
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:30,524
I don't know.

315
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:43,203
Fucking dead people.

316
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:44,788
Everything we've got on Noonan's

317
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:46,907
1979 homicide conviction.

318
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:49,092
Evidence logs, witness statements.

319
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:50,427
Plea agreements in there too.

320
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:52,462
- Frances...
- Mmm?

321
00:16:52,514 --> 00:16:54,298
- If I hadn't already gone
through that phase in college,

322
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:55,766
I'd kiss you.

323
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,351
So why are you interested

324
00:16:57,385 --> 00:16:59,219
in a murder that happened
while you were in diapers?

325
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:01,588
- A guy kills his wife
while she's taking a bath

326
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:02,923
30 years ago.

327
00:17:02,941 --> 00:17:04,591
We found a new victim a few days ago at,

328
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,259
Get this, his old address.

329
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:08,145
A coincidence?
I think fucking not.

330
00:17:08,196 --> 00:17:10,030
You forgetting something?

331
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:11,765
Your father's old confidential
informant folders

332
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:12,950
aren't gonna re-file themselves.

333
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:14,568
Sorry.

334
00:17:14,602 --> 00:17:17,154
Susannah Coffey.
Another blast from the past.

335
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:18,822
Hmm, was she at least useful?

336
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:20,457
Only as a reminder to wear sunblock.

337
00:17:20,491 --> 00:17:23,043
But I'm still waiting
on a few call backs

338
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:24,545
from some other names on the list.

339
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,380
But so far, I'm starting to think

340
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:30,617
maybe I fucked around more
than my old man did.

341
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:31,885
Just work the scene.

342
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,970
Don't raise flags.

343
00:17:33,004 --> 00:17:34,922
Just work the scene...

344
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:37,674
Then get the hell to the boxing arena.

345
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:42,729
Get those news trucks out of here.

346
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:43,797
I got a coroner's van coming through.

347
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:45,816
Copy that.

348
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:49,686
Hey, Joey.

349
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:51,321
This is an active crime scene, Ma'am.

350
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:53,106
I'm gonna need you behind that tape.

351
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,475
"Ma'am"?

352
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:57,110
- Your article,
"Vacation murder"?

353
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:58,996
"Murders" now, it seems.

354
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,313
See, how am I supposed to talk to you

355
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,615
when I got to watch everything I say?

356
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:07,170
- Which means you do still
want to talk to me?

357
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:08,538
Yeah, I do.

358
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,706
Good.

359
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:11,825
'Cause I like talking to you.

360
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:14,327
Amongst other things.

361
00:18:14,345 --> 00:18:15,879
Those things are good, but we got

362
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,215
to have some ground rules.

363
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:24,170
Quinn, I need you to run an inventory

364
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:25,722
On the victim's personal effects.

365
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:28,225
I'm on it, boss.

366
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:29,610
Stay back here, Ma'am.

367
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:31,228
You know better.

368
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:35,015
Your timing sucks.

369
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:36,700
What have we got here?

370
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:38,986
- Shot from behind as he was
coming in the room.

371
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,021
Caught a medium-caliber bullet
in the back of the neck.

372
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,824
- Empty wallet, watch missing,
drawer's empty.

373
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:45,659
- Someone figured out
it's easier to rob

374
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,160
people who are dead first.

375
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:50,047
- Directional swipe pattern
of one of the assailant's shoes

376
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:51,248
shows he went that way.

377
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,033
Okay, Angel, start a canvass.

378
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:54,918
Guests, employees, security cameras.

379
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:55,919
Already handled.

380
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,471
Next of kin will have to be notified.

381
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:59,556
- Got it, if you're good
with that, Lieutenant.

382
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,891
You got your hands full here.

383
00:19:00,925 --> 00:19:02,926
I'll deal with it.

384
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:05,929
- What's up with the boss lady
taking lead on your case?

385
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,981
- Chain of command is there
for a reason, Vince.

386
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:09,516
Just do your God damn job.

387
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:12,569
Dude, your gills are green.

388
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:14,071
You gonna blow?

389
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:16,106
Uh, I need to get some air.

390
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:27,617
Don't have time for this.

391
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:31,237
Oh.

392
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:33,907
Are we blood?

393
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:46,269
Join you?

394
00:19:46,304 --> 00:19:49,389
- 1:00.
Some things-

395
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,274
Holy-what-the-fuck is that?

396
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:52,442
Sushi.

397
00:19:52,477 --> 00:19:54,778
- What happened to the
daily cucumber sammy?

398
00:19:54,812 --> 00:19:57,531
It retire along with the rest of you?

399
00:19:57,565 --> 00:19:59,566
All that cream cheese wasn't exactly

400
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,768
helping my cholesterol.

401
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:04,988
I'm sorry.
This is too fucking weird.

402
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,240
- I can get a sandwich if
it makes you more comfortable.

403
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,459
No, it's...

404
00:20:09,494 --> 00:20:11,611
This.

405
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:13,613
Us.

406
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:16,116
I haven't seen you, spoken to you,

407
00:20:16,134 --> 00:20:18,085
Or exchanged so much as
a fucking Christmas card

408
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,753
with you in two years.

409
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:21,671
Now all of a sudden you're in Miami,

410
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:23,640
holding a pair of chopsticks
without so much

411
00:20:23,674 --> 00:20:26,059
as an email saying,
"hey, remember me?

412
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:27,677
"We used to fuck.
I'm coming to town.

413
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:29,479
You want to grab lunch?"

414
00:20:29,514 --> 00:20:32,966
I mean, seriously.
What the fuck?

415
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:36,186
I know.
Same old mouth.

416
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:37,971
Not without its charm.

417
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:39,305
Really?

418
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:42,809
That's all you have to say to me?

419
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:46,496
- I should have let you know
I was coming to Miami.

420
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:48,698
This task force they're trying
to put together

421
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,983
is hush-hush.

422
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:52,318
Plus I knew you'd be busy,

423
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:54,121
what with making Detective and all.

424
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:56,990
Yeah, well, tell me about it.

425
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:58,792
I have a suspect en route.

426
00:20:58,826 --> 00:21:00,627
The Lisa Bell case?

427
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:03,046
What do you know about Lisa Bell?

428
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:08,051
Only what your brother's told me.

429
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:11,521
Well, "check this," she brags.

430
00:21:11,556 --> 00:21:13,356
We found another murder.

431
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:14,691
30 years old.

432
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:16,443
Same M.O., same address,

433
00:21:16,477 --> 00:21:18,195
Same fucking bathtub.

434
00:21:18,229 --> 00:21:19,229
A guy was convicted.

435
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,480
He's back out in the world.

436
00:21:20,514 --> 00:21:23,316
So how do I not like him
for slicing up Lisa Bell?

437
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,452
Sounds like he deserves a good hard look.

438
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:27,704
I had patrol pick him up.

439
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:29,206
Should be here any minute.

440
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,459
Mind if I tag along?

441
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:33,794
To the interview?

442
00:21:33,828 --> 00:21:38,215
- I'd like to see Detective
Morgan in all her glory.

443
00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:41,051
- Sounds like someone's bored
with retirement already.

444
00:21:41,085 --> 00:21:42,586
- Here you go.
Thanks very much.

445
00:21:42,637 --> 00:21:44,838
Keep the change.

446
00:21:44,872 --> 00:21:46,506
Come on, guys.

447
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,508
Come on, boys.

448
00:22:01,272 --> 00:22:02,722
Oh, sorry, Sir.

449
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,441
It was an accident.

450
00:22:04,492 --> 00:22:05,775
It's okay, kiddo.

451
00:22:05,827 --> 00:22:07,527
It happens.

452
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:08,995
What is that, strawberry?

453
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,831
Uh, bubble gum gelato.

454
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:14,034
- How, uh...
Repulsive.

455
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:22,742
You better catch up with your mom.

456
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,761
You don't want to lose her.

457
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:34,271
Just had to find blood, didn't you?

458
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:36,223
It is my job.

459
00:22:36,257 --> 00:22:38,024
And you've got a family to support

460
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:40,110
and people to dismember.

461
00:22:40,144 --> 00:22:41,728
You're spinning too many plates, Dexter.

462
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:43,396
The sooner I wrap this up,

463
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,098
the sooner I get to the boxing arena.

464
00:22:45,116 --> 00:22:46,283
You might want to give some thought

465
00:22:46,317 --> 00:22:47,317
as to what happens when somebody else

466
00:22:47,368 --> 00:22:49,319
finds that body.

467
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:55,659
- Manager's on his way
to open the safe.

468
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,911
- What's the date of birth
on his passport?

469
00:22:57,945 --> 00:23:00,080
5/5/72.

470
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,093
Geez.

471
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:35,699
Don't sweat it, Quinn.

472
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,618
I've got much bigger things
to worry about.

473
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:40,653
- I filled in the Lieutenant
on what we found.

474
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:42,822
"We"?

475
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,925
Dude, there's no "me" in "team. "

476
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:47,711
Well, technically there is, but-

477
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:49,129
Blood deposit on the yucca

478
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:50,347
on the assailant's escape route.

479
00:23:50,381 --> 00:23:51,681
He probably scraped himself.

480
00:23:51,716 --> 00:23:52,966
Does that mean we have his DNA?

481
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,967
I'll run it through the database

482
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:55,001
soon as I get back to the lab.

483
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:56,136
Go.

484
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,638
You, come with me.

485
00:23:58,672 --> 00:24:00,390
I'm going...

486
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:02,692
Just not where you think.

487
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:05,779
- You were convicted of killing
your wife back in '79.

488
00:24:05,813 --> 00:24:07,480
Sliced open her femoral artery.

489
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:09,366
She bled to death in your bathtub.

490
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,651
Do I need to talk to a lawyer?

491
00:24:11,685 --> 00:24:13,453
At this point, we're interviewing you

492
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:15,121
to get more or less an expert opinion.

493
00:24:15,156 --> 00:24:17,023
- See, your case bears an
uncanny resemblance

494
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,658
to a case we're working on now.

495
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:22,662
Same M.O. ? la that femoral artery.

496
00:24:22,696 --> 00:24:24,965
Same house.

497
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:26,049
Same everything.

498
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,134
No fucking way.

499
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:30,220
Yes fucking way.

500
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:33,340
Sort of puts you at number one,
person-of-interest-wise.

501
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:34,641
I didn't kill my wife.

502
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:36,042
Oh, no?

503
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,594
You're just another
innocent man behind bars

504
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:38,711
for no good reason.

505
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,430
The fucking deck was stacked

506
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:42,215
before I walked into that courtroom

507
00:24:42,233 --> 00:24:44,234
in a death penalty state.

508
00:24:44,268 --> 00:24:46,186
You copped to doing the deed.

509
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,437
You took the deal.

510
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:49,072
I did my time and I moved on.

511
00:24:49,106 --> 00:24:50,273
You moved on to Lisa Bell.

512
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:52,275
Who is Lisa Bell?

513
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,727
- The young lady that you killed
last Monday night

514
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:56,579
in your old house.

515
00:24:56,614 --> 00:25:01,951
Whatever sick fucking poetry
you find in that.

516
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:06,572
Tell us what you did, Mr. Noonan.

517
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:11,177
It was muggy for so late at night.

518
00:25:11,212 --> 00:25:15,015
And Vicky, my wife,

519
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:18,885
wanted to cool off in the tub, so...

520
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:24,257
I went out to score some shit
and I came back.

521
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:26,592
And I found her.

522
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,234
I wish I could buy the tears.

523
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:36,236
I just...

524
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,238
I can't get there.

525
00:25:38,272 --> 00:25:40,490
Monday night I was working a swing shift

526
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:42,325
at the homeless shelter in Allapatah

527
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:44,244
hosing piss off the sidewalk

528
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:46,212
from the folks waiting to get inside

529
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:50,950
until 8:00-fucking-A.M.

530
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:52,886
We'll call the homeless shelter.

531
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,888
Verify your story.

532
00:26:00,511 --> 00:26:03,296
One, the guy's a train wreck.

533
00:26:03,314 --> 00:26:05,815
Two, he's a total slob,
he smells like a sewer,

534
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,467
And his fingernails are disgusting.

535
00:26:07,485 --> 00:26:08,518
Our killer's meticulous.

536
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,520
Zero DNA left at the crime scene.

537
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:11,971
- Obviously you caught his
case of the shakes.

538
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:14,324
- Given his rehab history,
I'm voting DTS.

539
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:16,443
- And Lisa Bell was cut
with surgical precision.

540
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:20,480
So, Detective Morgan...

541
00:26:20,498 --> 00:26:21,581
Are we in agreement here?

542
00:26:21,615 --> 00:26:23,783
Violent agreement...

543
00:26:23,817 --> 00:26:25,668
Retired Special Agent Lundy.

544
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:27,921
If Noonan didn't kill Lisa Bell,

545
00:26:27,955 --> 00:26:30,540
Why is the M.O. the same
as his wife's murder?

546
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:31,541
Copycat?

547
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,493
Of an obscure 30-year-old crime?

548
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:36,546
Do we think Noonan's telling the truth...

549
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,331
That he didn't kill his wife?

550
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:39,832
I believe we do.

551
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,851
Shit.

552
00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:45,004
I have a theory I'd like to run by you.

553
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:47,273
We could grab dinner, review the case,

554
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:49,776
Maybe catch a bad guy.

555
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:55,532
I... Uh...

556
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,400
Okay, I guess.

557
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:59,536
Um, I've got to cut Noonan loose

558
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,571
And make sure he talks to a lawyer.

559
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:04,824
If our side railroaded him
into that plea bargain,

560
00:27:04,858 --> 00:27:07,210
he could have one fuck mother of a case.

561
00:27:07,244 --> 00:27:09,796
You have a good heart, Debra.

562
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,297
Pick you up around 8:00?

563
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:14,634
Yeah, so I'll-

564
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:18,304
Yes.
Yes.

565
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,569
- The boxing arena's at
the next off ramp,

566
00:27:49,587 --> 00:27:52,622
But I still have miles to go
before I sleep.

567
00:27:57,428 --> 00:28:00,746
Bits and pieces.

568
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:03,550
Memory fragments.

569
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:05,585
All I have from last night.

570
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:26,823
Looks like I got the job done.

571
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:29,826
Almost.

572
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:32,745
Blood.

573
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:36,549
I was off my game.

574
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:39,085
Sloppy.

575
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,503
With Harry's code ingrained in me,

576
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:43,056
Cleaning a kill room should be automatic.

577
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,674
The code.

578
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:47,644
Etched into my memory to ensure survival.

579
00:28:47,678 --> 00:28:51,598
What would I do if I couldn't
properly dispose of a body?

580
00:28:51,632 --> 00:28:54,601
I'd hide it.

581
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:03,326
I investigate crime scenes
all the time.

582
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,977
But this one...

583
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:08,581
My crime scene...

584
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:13,369
It's giving me nothing.

585
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,322
Damn it.

586
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,490
Focus.

587
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:18,875
Track it.

588
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:20,710
Where did I go from here?

589
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:24,163
The pharmacy.

590
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:26,716
Harrison's ear ache medicine.

591
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:30,336
The only stop I made before the crash.

592
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,809
The only stop I remember.

593
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:52,575
If you thought you were coming right back,

594
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,160
Not a bad hiding place.

595
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:56,496
Why are you wearing those?

596
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:01,084
- This is the way I was dressed
the first time we met.

597
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:02,868
Your mother's murder was the last time

598
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,036
your memory was a blank.

599
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:05,138
Why do you suppose that is?

600
00:30:05,172 --> 00:30:07,173
- Not in front of my baby!
No!

601
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:12,011
Because not remembering saved me.

602
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:13,396
And now if you want to save yourself,

603
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,431
You have to remember.

604
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:23,823
If you don't fix this screw-up,

605
00:30:23,857 --> 00:30:25,408
Harrison's only memory of his father

606
00:30:25,442 --> 00:30:26,776
will be of you behind bars.

607
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:28,244
It's not a screw-up.

608
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:31,531
I just can't remember.

609
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:33,750
Got to check today's incident reports.

610
00:30:33,784 --> 00:30:37,286
Make sure Benny's body hasn't surfaced.

611
00:30:37,338 --> 00:30:39,922
It's in this city somewhere.

612
00:30:39,957 --> 00:30:41,741
Thanks for meeting me here.

613
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,426
The sooner we get an estimate
and file a claim,

614
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,211
the sooner my husband
gets his car back.

615
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:46,912
- Well, that much damage,
I wouldn't even try

616
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:51,250
to talk you into fixing it.

617
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:53,085
I thought it was a fender bender.

618
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:54,804
Well, I'm sure there's a bent fender

619
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:56,305
somewhere in this mess.

620
00:30:56,357 --> 00:30:57,724
Oh, my God.

621
00:30:57,758 --> 00:30:59,859
Everybody got off easy on this one.

622
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:02,111
Your husband, my company.

623
00:31:02,146 --> 00:31:05,598
He should count his blessings.

624
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:07,984
Yes, he should.

625
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,736
- Hey, buddy.
You lose something?

626
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,455
There's an understatement.

627
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:14,106
Can't find my I.D.

628
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:16,609
Use mine to buzz you in.

629
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:19,212
All right.

630
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:20,380
Thanks.

631
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:22,165
Look, the other day after court,

632
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,417
I was totally out of line going
off on you like that.

633
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:26,753
Gomez is the criminal, not you.

634
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:27,787
No, not me.

635
00:31:27,805 --> 00:31:29,305
Plan on having a heart-to-heart

636
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:31,007
with the prick when I find him.

637
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,475
Benny?

638
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:34,143
- Yeah, want him to know
he's still on my radar,

639
00:31:34,178 --> 00:31:35,795
But he's been laying low.

640
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,482
- Look, can we do this
another time?

641
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:56,032
My password.

642
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,625
Access denied, Dex.

643
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:09,662
- I can't even remember
my own password.

644
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,465
I'm here to help.

645
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:18,387
Think.

646
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:21,507
H-a-r-r-y.

647
00:32:24,728 --> 00:32:29,014
Thanks, dad.

648
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:30,283
Bank hold-up.

649
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:32,184
Alligator in backyard.

650
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:35,822
Kidnapped three year old found safe.

651
00:32:35,856 --> 00:32:37,857
But no body parts turning up.

652
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:04,717
From boxing arena, to pharmacy,
to the crash.

653
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:10,556
What am I missing?

654
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:13,242
Girl scout cookie time again?

655
00:33:13,277 --> 00:33:16,028
No, I froze them in case of emergency.

656
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:18,898
What's the emergency?

657
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,082
Frank Lundy.

658
00:33:20,117 --> 00:33:22,785
I haven't heard from him
in, like, forever,

659
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:24,253
and then he shows up out of the blue

660
00:33:24,288 --> 00:33:26,289
for some hush-hush task force
and wants to know

661
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,907
all about my case.

662
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:29,592
Not to drag you into my shit.

663
00:33:29,626 --> 00:33:30,927
Drag away.

664
00:33:30,961 --> 00:33:33,212
In this boys' club,
who else you gonna talk to?

665
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:35,464
- This is about him trying
to get next to me.

666
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:38,100
Maybe, but you do have a boyfriend.

667
00:33:38,135 --> 00:33:39,969
Hell yeah, I do.

668
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,188
A good one.

669
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:43,756
And I'm really fucking happy.

670
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:45,224
Can I make a suggestion

671
00:33:45,258 --> 00:33:48,110
before you eat the box too?

672
00:33:48,145 --> 00:33:51,230
If there is still something, anything,

673
00:33:51,264 --> 00:33:52,365
Between you and Lundy-

674
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,400
There's so not.

675
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:58,454
Closure will set you free.

676
00:33:58,488 --> 00:34:01,073
Does my hair look better up or down?

677
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:03,943
Down definitely.

678
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:05,945
Thanks.

679
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,883
Okay, Benny, I got to find you

680
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,451
before anyone else does.

681
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,387
Better fucking start all over again.

682
00:34:14,421 --> 00:34:17,306
Nothing on the DNA results
from the blood on the cactus.

683
00:34:17,341 --> 00:34:20,092
No match in the database.
Sorry.

684
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:21,811
- Hang on.
No one's going anywhere.

685
00:34:21,845 --> 00:34:23,095
Oh, shit.

686
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:24,463
Listen up, guys.

687
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:25,982
Everyone working the Vacation murders,

688
00:34:26,016 --> 00:34:27,984
I'm holding over your shift
until further notice.

689
00:34:28,018 --> 00:34:30,102
Call home, let your people know
they'll see you

690
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:31,437
when they see you.

691
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:33,472
Quinn, my office.

692
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:49,822
I'm gonna ask you if we have a problem

693
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,340
and I expect the truth.

694
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:53,659
- Look, Lieutenant,
what happened at the hotel,

695
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:55,761
it's not what you think.

696
00:34:55,796 --> 00:34:58,764
Detective...

697
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:00,049
I'm not gonna tell you who to date.

698
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,384
It's none of my business.

699
00:35:01,435 --> 00:35:02,718
But you should know there's no such thing

700
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,854
as "off the record" with reporters.

701
00:35:04,888 --> 00:35:08,340
So watch the pillow talk with that woman.

702
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:10,059
Not a problem, Lieutenant.

703
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,478
Talking isn't what we do best anyway.

704
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:34,133
Debra?

705
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:35,534
I thought I was picking you up.

706
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,369
I need to clear some things up

707
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:40,840
and I owe you nothing less
than complete transparency.

708
00:35:40,874 --> 00:35:44,927
Want anything?

709
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:47,179
Tea? Water?

710
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:49,348
I don't want to mislead you.

711
00:35:49,382 --> 00:35:52,051
And I certainly don't want to hurt you.

712
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:56,522
It's just that what I have with Anton,

713
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:59,158
it's great.

714
00:35:59,192 --> 00:36:02,495
It's really fucking great
and we live together.

715
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:04,613
And...

716
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:06,231
it's great.

717
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:09,785
And... For the first time in so long,

718
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:12,755
I'm actually...

719
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:15,291
happy.

720
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:16,575
No offense.

721
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:18,243
- You sure you don't want
something to drink?

722
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:20,763
Did you not hear a word I just said?

723
00:36:20,797 --> 00:36:21,964
Everything's great.

724
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,716
Exactly.

725
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,470
So if you've come back here to...

726
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:31,607
rekindle something between us...

727
00:36:31,641 --> 00:36:33,142
It's not gonna happen.

728
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:35,978
In the interest of transparency,

729
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:38,314
My purpose in coming to Miami is-

730
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:40,116
Work related.

731
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,101
Cut the shit, Frank.
You're retired.

732
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,987
The reason I'm in Miami

733
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:48,574
is because I'm convinced that
these bathtub murders -

734
00:36:48,608 --> 00:36:51,944
Noonan's wife, Lisa Bell - are connected

735
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:54,997
to a series of murders
all over the country.

736
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:06,926
Oh.

737
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,765
- It's become something of
an obsession of mine and...

738
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:14,900
I'm not about to ride off
into the sunset

739
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:16,819
and dump something this horrific

740
00:37:16,853 --> 00:37:18,821
on whoever gets my office next.

741
00:37:18,855 --> 00:37:21,273
Christ.

742
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:23,809
I-

743
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:25,361
I've got to go.

744
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:26,612
I'm an idiot.

745
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:28,647
Debra.

746
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:40,993
Rita, what are you doing here?

747
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:42,545
You lied to me, Dexter.

748
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:44,797
I saw your car.
It wasn't a fender bender.

749
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:45,848
It was destroyed.

750
00:37:45,882 --> 00:37:47,550
I didn't want you to worry.

751
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:49,718
- Yeah, well,
you're not doing a good job.

752
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,003
I'm worried sick about you.

753
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:54,173
I'm fine.

754
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:56,341
All right, a little headache
and a stiff neck.

755
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:57,943
- Get your stuff.
I'm gonna take you home.

756
00:37:57,978 --> 00:37:59,061
I can't.

757
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:00,345
The Lieutenant is holding
over the shift

758
00:38:00,363 --> 00:38:04,150
because of these murders
that are in all the papers.

759
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:05,818
You fell asleep at the wheel.

760
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:07,703
Almost got killed because
of the hours

761
00:38:07,737 --> 00:38:10,156
that they keep you here night
after night after night.

762
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,124
So much for my standard alibi.

763
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,659
This is a job I signed on for.

764
00:38:13,693 --> 00:38:15,044
I'm sorry.

765
00:38:15,078 --> 00:38:16,462
I didn't sign on to be a widow.

766
00:38:16,496 --> 00:38:17,880
You know what?
I'll just talk to Maria myself.

767
00:38:17,914 --> 00:38:19,665
- Rita, no.
Don't do this.

768
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:21,667
Not here.
This is my job.

769
00:38:21,701 --> 00:38:24,553
It's how I support all of us.

770
00:38:24,588 --> 00:38:27,590
What if you wind up dead in a ditch?

771
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:33,395
- All these people put in
the same hours that I do.

772
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:36,215
- Yes, but you were
in the hospital last night.

773
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:37,349
They weren't.

774
00:38:37,383 --> 00:38:40,986
- And the doctor gave me
a clean bill of health.

775
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:44,723
You could talk to him yourself.

776
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:50,579
- No.
No, I don't-

777
00:38:50,614 --> 00:38:51,914
I don't want to talk to your doctor.

778
00:38:51,948 --> 00:38:53,282
I want you to.

779
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:55,417
- I mean, I guess he wouldn't
have released you

780
00:38:55,452 --> 00:38:58,337
if it was anything serious.

781
00:38:58,371 --> 00:39:01,373
- I'm sure they'd all rather
be home with their families,

782
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:04,576
just like me.

783
00:39:04,594 --> 00:39:06,245
I know.

784
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:09,248
Come on, I'll walk you out.

785
00:39:33,156 --> 00:39:34,273
You gonna pick that up?

786
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:35,991
No, I am not, Vince.

787
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:39,161
You got a problem with that?

788
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:41,446
Dude, seriously, 86 the caffeine.

789
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:42,998
You're freaking me out.

790
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:45,000
I have someplace I need to be.

791
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:46,919
I also have places I need to be.

792
00:39:46,953 --> 00:39:52,591
Not good places, but... places.

793
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:53,893
Come on, blood.

794
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:57,646
Talk to me.

795
00:39:57,681 --> 00:40:00,632
If somebody tested positive for an STD,

796
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:04,303
would they have to register with
the Miami health authorities?

797
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:06,405
And why would you ask me that?

798
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:08,473
Yes or no, Vince?

799
00:40:13,813 --> 00:40:15,915
Lieutenant.

800
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:17,166
Found your guy.

801
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,817
Name's Johnny Rose.

802
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:19,985
You found a suspect?

803
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,287
All his info's in there.

804
00:40:21,321 --> 00:40:23,622
How?

805
00:40:23,656 --> 00:40:25,991
- I reworked the blood sample
looking for other markers

806
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:29,428
And found a street 14 strain
of drug-resistant Syphilis.

807
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:31,847
I checked that against the STD registry

808
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:34,466
for anyone being treated
with heavy-duty meds

809
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,834
over the last week.

810
00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:38,503
Turned up a few prostitutes
and one Johnny Rose.

811
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:40,272
Good science says he's your guy.

812
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:42,674
Okay, briefing room in five minutes.

813
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:44,193
Strategy meeting.

814
00:40:44,227 --> 00:40:49,031
Dexter's turned up a lead
on our shooter.

815
00:40:49,065 --> 00:40:50,682
Hey, Dex, hold up.

816
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,152
- I need to be somewhere.
- Good work back there.

817
00:40:53,186 --> 00:40:54,987
This Rose guy gets syphilis
and fingered for murder?

818
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:56,488
That's burning it at both ends, huh?

819
00:40:56,522 --> 00:40:58,907
- Yeah, I really got to go.
Wife, kids.

820
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:00,709
Come on, Dex.

821
00:41:00,744 --> 00:41:02,211
What do say we grab a beer this week,

822
00:41:02,245 --> 00:41:04,163
figure out how to come
at Benny Gomez next?

823
00:41:04,197 --> 00:41:05,464
Quinn!

824
00:41:05,498 --> 00:41:07,049
I have a life.
You have a life.

825
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:09,385
Just leave it alone.
All right?

826
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:19,261
Benny Gomez.

827
00:41:19,312 --> 00:41:20,479
The last place I'm gonna look

828
00:41:20,513 --> 00:41:24,350
is the last place I saw you.

829
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:28,187
Moment of your time, Lieutenant?

830
00:41:28,221 --> 00:41:32,391
<i>Escuchame, Maria.</i>

831
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:35,110
Angel...

832
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:37,746
People will think something's up.

833
00:41:37,781 --> 00:41:42,668
Something is.

834
00:41:42,702 --> 00:41:44,169
Angel, if this is about the Mayor,

835
00:41:44,204 --> 00:41:45,421
I had no choice.

836
00:41:45,455 --> 00:41:48,374
- I'm not angry about you
taking me off the case.

837
00:41:48,408 --> 00:41:49,574
It's how you did it.

838
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:53,712
<i>Angel, por favor.</i>

839
00:41:53,746 --> 00:41:56,348
I don't even know how to act
around you anymore.

840
00:41:56,383 --> 00:41:58,350
This isn't easy for me either.

841
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:05,808
Maybe we need a...

842
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:08,644
break.

843
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:11,596
Yeah, you're right.

844
00:42:11,614 --> 00:42:16,151
It's probably for the best.

845
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:22,875
So that's that.

846
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:44,129
So?

847
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:48,300
So.

848
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:51,270
Why are we thinking ourselves
out of a good thing?

849
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,614
- What do you think's
going on in there?

850
00:43:02,648 --> 00:43:03,648
Who cares.

851
00:43:10,123 --> 00:43:13,542
I'm so glad you're home.

852
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:14,993
Hey, it's not my birthday.

853
00:43:15,011 --> 00:43:17,513
- Can't a girlfriend be glad
her boyfriend's home?

854
00:43:17,547 --> 00:43:20,165
I was gone for two days.

855
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:22,718
I fucking love you.

856
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:24,853
- I love you.
- I love you.

857
00:43:24,888 --> 00:43:27,055
- I love you.
- I love you.

858
00:43:34,347 --> 00:43:36,648
Back to square one.

859
00:43:36,682 --> 00:43:39,952
Literally.

860
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:47,209
Yeah?

861
00:43:47,243 --> 00:43:49,528
- Dexter.
Frank Lundy here.

862
00:43:49,546 --> 00:43:52,331
- The last person in the world
I want to hear from.

863
00:43:52,365 --> 00:43:54,032
Glad to hear from you.

864
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,802
I need to talk to you...

865
00:43:56,836 --> 00:43:58,837
About Trinity.

866
00:44:03,977 --> 00:44:06,378
I'm tired of swimming against

867
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:08,730
the bureaucratic tide by myself.

868
00:44:08,765 --> 00:44:11,066
Can we maybe toss a few ideas around?

869
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,402
You seem to have the dot-connecting gift.

870
00:44:13,436 --> 00:44:14,886
<i>More like had.</i>

871
00:44:16,439 --> 00:44:20,409
I'm glad to help,
but tonight's not really, um...

872
00:44:20,443 --> 00:44:21,410
optimal.

873
00:44:21,444 --> 00:44:22,411
I get it.

874
00:44:22,445 --> 00:44:23,579
New dad, new family.

875
00:44:23,613 --> 00:44:25,897
Your life has changed in so many ways.

876
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:28,450
Yeah, I see that now.

877
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:30,836
Trinity is going to kill again.

878
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,788
Soon.

879
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:33,872
Another woman.

880
00:44:33,906 --> 00:44:37,092
Older than Lisa Bell this time.

881
00:44:37,126 --> 00:44:41,630
Somewhere out there is a woman
who is going to die...

882
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:44,683
and she'll have no idea why.

883
00:44:46,085 --> 00:44:47,519
Whoa, whoa!

884
00:44:47,554 --> 00:44:49,188
Watch your step there.

885
00:44:49,222 --> 00:44:50,722
Oh, hey.

886
00:44:50,756 --> 00:44:52,941
How cute are you?

887
00:44:52,976 --> 00:44:55,777
Smell my puppy, don't you?

888
00:44:55,812 --> 00:44:56,812
What's his name?

889
00:44:56,863 --> 00:44:57,946
This is Checkers.

890
00:44:59,115 --> 00:45:01,116
My mother was a lifelong Republican.

891
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,267
Well, no family's perfect.

892
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:05,037
Indeed.

893
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:06,738
What kind of pup you have?

894
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:08,991
Um, just a mutt, but she's great

895
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:10,125
with my children.

896
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:11,543
So you must live around here, huh?

897
00:45:11,578 --> 00:45:12,961
Yeah, it's such a great neighborhood.

898
00:45:12,996 --> 00:45:14,246
Everyone's so friendly.

899
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,297
Well, in the interest of friendly,

900
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:16,548
let me help you with these.

901
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,217
- Oh, it's really okay.
I'm just up there.

902
00:45:18,251 --> 00:45:20,385
So I'll take one, you take the other.

903
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,837
Lighten the load, huh?

904
00:45:21,888 --> 00:45:22,921
I appreciate it.

905
00:45:22,955 --> 00:45:24,172
My arms were falling off.

906
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:29,895
- My dog won't get your puppy
all riled up?

907
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:31,897
- Molly?
Oh, God, no.

908
00:45:31,931 --> 00:45:34,516
She's the calmest little thing
in the world.

909
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:35,901
How long have you lived around here?

910
00:45:35,935 --> 00:45:37,636
Uh, three years next month.

911
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:41,139
- Oh, surprised we've never
run into each other till now.

912
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:43,075
I'm Allen, by the way.

913
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:45,244
Tarla.

914
00:45:45,278 --> 00:45:46,778
Um, this is me.

915
00:45:46,812 --> 00:45:48,146
Thank you so much for your help.

916
00:45:48,164 --> 00:45:49,648
Sure.

917
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:51,149
Great.

918
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:54,286
Oh, and bye to you too, Checkers.

919
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,321
Until next time.

920
00:46:11,638 --> 00:46:14,640
Off you go, Checkers,
or whatever your name is.

921
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:21,446
Lundy thinks he can predict the future,

922
00:46:21,481 --> 00:46:25,617
but I'm more interested in the past.

923
00:46:25,652 --> 00:46:29,321
My past.

924
00:46:29,355 --> 00:46:31,657
I already cleaned this.

925
00:46:31,691 --> 00:46:34,660
That I remember.

926
00:46:40,216 --> 00:46:42,968
Now it makes sense.

927
00:46:43,002 --> 00:46:46,004
Harry was reminding me the whole time.

928
00:46:49,842 --> 00:46:52,844
I was reminding myself the whole time.

929
00:47:07,727 --> 00:47:13,248
Hello, Benny.

930
00:47:13,282 --> 00:47:15,283
Good-bye, Benny.

931
00:47:37,306 --> 00:47:42,477
Got to admit...
pretty clever.

932
00:47:42,528 --> 00:47:44,279
Hiding Benny Gomez like that

933
00:47:44,313 --> 00:47:46,114
until I could come back and get him.

934
00:47:46,149 --> 00:47:48,617
You turned to the code.

935
00:47:48,651 --> 00:47:52,454
A core memory.

936
00:47:52,488 --> 00:47:55,440
I taught you well.

937
00:47:55,458 --> 00:47:59,277
Finding Gomez was a band-aid.

938
00:47:59,295 --> 00:48:02,464
You're juggling family, work...

939
00:48:02,498 --> 00:48:04,583
and a dark passenger
who's always got one hand

940
00:48:04,617 --> 00:48:06,885
On the steering wheel.

941
00:48:06,919 --> 00:48:09,888
I can do it.

942
00:48:09,922 --> 00:48:13,141
I can manage...

943
00:48:13,176 --> 00:48:16,845
All these moving parts.

944
00:48:16,896 --> 00:48:19,297
Until you can't.

945
00:48:19,315 --> 00:48:21,316
Then what?

946
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:28,473
Night, dad.

947
00:48:28,491 --> 00:48:30,609
Sleep.

948
00:48:30,643 --> 00:48:33,144
Just one beautiful night's sleep

949
00:48:33,162 --> 00:48:38,450
Will make everything better... again.

950
00:48:50,513 --> 00:49:06,611
Fuck.
