1
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,467
Previously on "Dexter"...

2
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:50,034
we have to catch them
in the act at the shipyard.

3
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:53,733
He's gonna find out,
and then he's gonna kill me.

4
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:56,934
Harry knew my mother.

5
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:59,700
Why would rita print out
narcotics anonymous literature

6
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:00,967
If paul's dead?

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,100
Because recently
i entered the program.

8
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:05,367
How many fucking ways
to sunday

9
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:07,067
Do i have to tell you
that i'm fine, maria?

10
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,334
This is my department.

11
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:09,867
I need to know that you are fit
for duty.

12
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,067
That's my job
as a lieutenant!

13
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,000
I always stop and eat lunch
at 1:00.

14
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:15,067
You'll learn that about me.
Why don't you sit down?

15
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,434
You're very fidgety.
Anyone ever tell you that?

16
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:20,900
My father.

17
00:02:20,934 --> 00:02:22,900
You applying for the job?

18
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,467
Well,
you said you'd call.

19
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:27,568
Where are you,
and when are you coming back?

20
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:29,334
Uh, tomorrow morning.

21
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:31,201
Promise me you'll stop
by the house first thing.

22
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,501
I'll see you soon.

23
00:02:32,534 --> 00:02:34,634
Is she cool with you doing this? I didn't tell her.

24
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:35,934
I don't care
what you did.

25
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:38,034
I'm no longer sure
who made me what i am.

26
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:40,467
Funny thing is i've met someone
who doesn't care.

27
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:42,301
I want to talk to you
about coral cove.

28
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:43,767
What about coral cove?

29
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,234
The algae on the rocks
sent us there.

30
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:48,234
If i were you, i would consider
moving your boat.

31
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:50,067
Security out there
sucks ass.

32
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,634
When i get back,
i need to hit the marina

33
00:02:51,668 --> 00:02:53,534
And make sure there's
no blood traces on my boat.

34
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,867
This isn't
a commercial marina.

35
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,167
But i can see the upkeep
on this place is dismal.

36
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:00,100
That's why i'm going to order
24-Hour surveillance

37
00:03:00,134 --> 00:03:01,568
On this marina
and the two others.

38
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:17,800
There's another shipment
coming in tomorrow.

39
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,467
Cocaine.

40
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,867
How much?

41
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,800
300 bricks,
give or take.

42
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,134
Can you get your hands
on some?

43
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,534
Harry, that wasn't part
of our agreement.

44
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:32,733
Look, laura,
we need hard evidence.

45
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:35,668
Otherwise, it's just your word
against estrada's.

46
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:40,568
I'll protect you.
I promise.

47
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:46,700
You better.

48
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:50,934
Meet me later?

49
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:53,601
Laura,
the tape's still rolling.

50
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:03,767
Very convincing.

51
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:07,767
What was that?

52
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:16,267
Laura,
the tape's still rolling.

53
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,201
Damn it.

54
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:23,134
My mother -
Confidential informant...

55
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,267
and mumbler.

56
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,767
Whatever sweet nothings
she had to whisper

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,367
I probably don't want to hear.

58
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:34,568
It seems that my foster father

59
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:37,301
And my biological mother
were having an affair.

60
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:39,700
It's bad enough
i can't shake the visual,

61
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:41,201
But the questions -

62
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:43,867
Did he blame himself
for her death?

63
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,733
Is that why he took me in?

64
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:49,434
Did he love her,
or was he just using her?

65
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:51,334
Was he using me?

66
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:53,334
I always thought harry's code

67
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:55,867
Was on-The-Spot
creative problem-Solving,

68
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,167
But maybe he planned for me
to settle the score all along.

69
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,867
It's times like this i wish
i really were a drug addict.

70
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,267
I had emotional problems
as a kid

71
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:07,833
Because of what happened
to my mother.

72
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:09,833
And harry tried to said
he was trying to help me,

73
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:11,833
But all we ever talked about
were his rules.

74
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:12,867
I spent so much time

75
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,201
Trying to live up
to his expectations

76
00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:16,167
Because i thought he had
my best interests in mind.

77
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:18,434
If you're going
to come over this late,

78
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:20,401
The least you could do
is bring me a coffee.

79
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:22,100
Sorry.

80
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:24,900
Cappuccino -
Make a note of it.

81
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:32,967
Truth is, dex,

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,601
It doesn't really matter
why harry did what he did.

83
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:37,434
The result's the same.

84
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:41,000
You have an addiction.

85
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:43,401
Do you think harry
made me what i am?

86
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:45,234
Plenty of people
go through trauma

87
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:46,833
Without turning
to addiction.

88
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:52,000
Whatever harry taught you
led you down the wrong path.

89
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:55,334
But i've built everything
in my life

90
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:57,267
On what harry said
i was supposed to be.

91
00:05:57,301 --> 00:05:59,700
My job, my girlfriend -

92
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:03,733
It's all what harry
told me i needed.

93
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:05,568
What do you think you need?

94
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,267
I have no idea.

95
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:11,334
Whatever's inside you

96
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:13,067
Is splattered all over
that paper

97
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,568
That i took from your lab.

98
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:18,067
Looks messy.

99
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,234
It probably is.

100
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:23,367
Look, dexter...

101
00:06:23,401 --> 00:06:26,034
everyone has a moment
when they realize

102
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:29,634
That their value system is
different from their parents'.

103
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:32,234
Mine was in college,

104
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,167
But, hey, maybe you're
a late bloomer.

105
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:36,334
Lucky me.

106
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:38,534
Damn right, lucky you.

107
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:41,601
You get to have
a fresh start.

108
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,334
Whatever you thought,
whatever you did doesn't matter.

109
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:48,100
Now you get to figure out
who you are.

110
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,434
I went to lila for answers,

111
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:56,867
But now all i have
is more questions.

112
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,800
Who am i?
What do i need?

113
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,401
What do i want?

114
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:04,067
Coffee - I really want
a cup of coffee.

115
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,334
What up, half-Day?

116
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:06,634
Is there coffee left?

117
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:08,201
You're late.

118
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:10,067
I fell asleep
before you got home last night.

119
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,434
Were you at rita's?

120
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,934
You're welcome, ass.

121
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,767
Your brother
looks like shit.

122
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,467
Tell me about it.

123
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:21,733
I may be
out of line with this,

124
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:23,501
But did he
fall off the wagon?

125
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:25,000
What wagon?

126
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:28,501
The only wagon dexter's ever had
is a radio flyer.

127
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:30,568
Your brother's a junkie.

128
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:32,100
Isn't he?

129
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:34,267
Dexter?

130
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:35,700
Are you high?

131
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:39,134
He's never even smoked
a cigarette.

132
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,367
I'm glad you got
some new material, though,

133
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:45,267
'Cause "freak" and "psycho"
were getting kind of tired.

134
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,000
Agent lundy.

135
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:01,201
So, i hear a rumor

136
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:03,900
You're tracking all
our internet activity.

137
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:05,201
So, is it true?

138
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,700
'Cause i can explain
all that she-Male stuff.

139
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,234
I need my team outside
in five minutes.

140
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:14,401
That sounds important.

141
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:16,334
I just got a major break
in the investigation.

142
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:19,134
Patrol found some guy saying he
escaped the bay harbor butcher.

143
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,534
He claimed he was captured
a couple hours ago.

144
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,201
Well, that's a neat trick,
considering i was asleep -

145
00:08:24,234 --> 00:08:25,800
At least trying to sleep.

146
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,000
This could be good news
for me.

147
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:29,601
Morgan.
Yes.

148
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,800
The other morgan.

149
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:34,034
I'd like you to join us,
if you can spare him.

150
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,401
That's fine with me.

151
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:37,234
Is there blood?

152
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,534
Not that i'm aware of, no.

153
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:40,167
But what about masuka?

154
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:43,100
Yeah, uh, i'm the lead
forensics investigator.

155
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:44,900
Masuka's lab work
is more pressing.

156
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:47,034
I need him to hold down the fort
at the station.

157
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:49,501
He totally saw
the she-Male stuff.

158
00:08:49,534 --> 00:08:50,668
So, what do you say?

159
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,067
I'll buy you lunch after -
Pork sandwich, right?

160
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,367
Uh, yes. Sure.
Good.

161
00:08:57,401 --> 00:09:00,467
I figured it was time to get
a fresh perspective on the case.

162
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:03,967
Rumor has it you have a knack
for attracting serial killers.

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,934
I hear the same about you.

164
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:10,201
Dexter also enjoys long walks
on the beach and foreign films.

165
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:12,467
Then we've got
a lot to talk about.

166
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:31,401
All right.
See you later.

167
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,201
He knocked me out.

168
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:38,501
Then when i woke up,

169
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:41,234
I was tied up
in that train car over there.

170
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:42,501
You said he used rope?

171
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:44,434
Dumb fuck.

172
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:47,000
I stretched it out enough
so i can get my legs free

173
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:48,467
And then busted out of there.

174
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:51,367
Ran across the road, almost got
hit by that guy in the car.

175
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:54,467
So, that's the alleged victim
of the bay harbor butcher.

176
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:58,301
But i've never seen him
before in my life.

177
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:00,100
Dex!

178
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:01,601
O'connor, singer...

179
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,134
make sure you take pictures
of those footprints.

180
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:06,301
Hey, dex.
Hey.

181
00:10:06,334 --> 00:10:09,800
So, the victim says the butcher
held him in this train car.

182
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,100
Lundy wants you to search
for trace evidence.

183
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:13,733
Your spidey sense
tingling yet?

184
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,334
We'll see when i get inside.

185
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:16,733
Take your time in there.

186
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:19,167
We've never been this close
to this pendejo.

187
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:23,034
Closer than you think, amigo.

188
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,201
He may have borrowed
my pseudonym,

189
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,367
But this guy doesn't know

190
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:39,167
The first thing
about my techniques -

191
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:41,568
Amateur.

192
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:43,367
What makes you think
it was the butcher?

193
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:44,800
Well, he told me

194
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,234
That the bay harbor butcher's
gonna clean up miami.

195
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:49,733
He said, "you're gonna get
what you deserve. "

196
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:52,034
And what do you deserve,
mr. Henry?

197
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:53,067
Well, look...

198
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,534
the butcher kills criminals,
right?

199
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:57,867
I just got out of jail,
you know -

200
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,301
Six years for aggravated assault
and home invasion.

201
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:03,668
He kills murderers.

202
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,568
You didn't kill anyone,
did you?

203
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:08,568
All right, i gave this old guy
a heart attack.

204
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:12,034
It's not like i was doing it
on purpose, all right?

205
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:15,534
I- I used to hit, you know,
retirement homes, communities.

206
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:17,700
Snowbirds are easy targets.

207
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:19,967
And i don't do that anymore.

208
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,467
I did my time.

209
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:23,167
Your mother
must be so proud.

210
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:28,100
I want to check out
the train car with your brother.

211
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:31,534
Why don't you keep an eye
on our friend here

212
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:34,234
While we confirm
his story?

213
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:38,167
Oh, yeah. Sure.

214
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:43,367
Killing tools left behind -
I'd never be this careless.

215
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:46,800
Whoever did this would
never pass harry's muster.

216
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,733
Then again,
neither would harry.

217
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,334
He lied about my past.

218
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:55,034
He cheated on my foster mother
with my biological mother.

219
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:58,733
Maybe lila's right. It's time
for a new set of standards.

220
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:01,201
If you were
the bay harbor butcher,

221
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:03,601
Would you use
a place like this?

222
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:08,034
Actually, yes.

223
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:10,167
Locationwise,
it's not a bad choice.

224
00:12:10,201 --> 00:12:13,434
It's quiet, remote.

225
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,900
Could use an upgrade in
the lighting department, but...

226
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:23,067
so, you think
this is our guy?

227
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:27,167
Not exactly.

228
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:29,367
From what i understand,

229
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:32,167
The conditions in this space
don't support his m. O.

230
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:35,267
It's filthy,
for one thing.

231
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:40,100
Butcher's clean,
orderly...

232
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:48,668
...and some people
would say compulsive.

233
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,367
Really? You think
he's compulsive?

234
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:55,634
This doesn't fit, either.

235
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:58,401
A hatchet is sloppy.

236
00:12:58,434 --> 00:13:01,867
The butcher uses precise
surgical instruments.

237
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,800
Well, he's not
that predictable.

238
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,700
Is he?

239
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,067
Mixes it up -
Different tools every time.

240
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,767
And never rope.

241
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,534
He uses duct tape
and plastic wrap.

242
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:14,668
Plastic wrap -
How can you tell?

243
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,467
Depression patterns
in the skin.

244
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:20,501
Maybe the butcher's
having an identity crisis.

245
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,167
It's entirely possible.

246
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:25,767
But not likely.

247
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,234
My guess is we're looking
for a vigilante

248
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:31,700
Inspired by
the butcher's principles.

249
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:33,568
Bet he never thought
he'd be a role model.

250
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:36,867
I bet you're right.

251
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,100
So, any new leads
on the real guy?

252
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:42,700
Not yet.

253
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,934
We're hoping the cameras
will turn something up.

254
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:47,301
Cameras?
In the marinas.

255
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:48,634
Put them in
a couple of days ago

256
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:51,733
To monitor
for suspicious activities.

257
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:55,067
Good news for all those cops
who keep boats at coral cove.

258
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,067
You've got one, too,
right?

259
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:03,000
Yeah. Yeah.

260
00:14:03,034 --> 00:14:06,234
We've been needing a security
upgrade for a long time now.

261
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:10,134
Has lundy seen me on the tape?

262
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:14,134
Is that why he invited me
along today - To mess with me?

263
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:20,334
Hey.

264
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:22,601
I'm sorry if i was short
with you this morning.

265
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:24,800
You know i'm lost
without my morning coffee.

266
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,100
Whatever.

267
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:30,034
How was your playdate
with lundy? Did you bond?

268
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,167
You didn't tell me

269
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:33,568
They put up security cameras
at the marinas.

270
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:36,634
It's not like
they're doing us any good.

271
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,434
We have to update
the station's computer system

272
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:40,733
Before we can synch up with
lundy's high-Tech equipment.

273
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:42,201
So the cameras
aren't recording?

274
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:44,467
Well, they are, but nobody's
seen any of the footage.

275
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:46,301
Lundy said it should be fixed
by tonight.

276
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:48,700
Well, that's a relief.

277
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,167
Your mom told me

278
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,000
About your cultural presentation
at school.

279
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:04,800
Did your teacher assign you
a country yet?

280
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,800
Saudi arabia.

281
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,401
No. That's israel.

282
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:13,401
I won't tell the saudis
you said that.

283
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:16,000
Looks like cody's
enjoying himself.

284
00:15:16,034 --> 00:15:17,800
Dexter's very patient
with him.

285
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,800
Dexter's a saint.

286
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,201
Where's astor?

287
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:24,800
Uh, she's by the water.

288
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,234
I want to say goodbye.

289
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:28,434
I got to go.

290
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:31,467
I was supposed to meet lila
10 minutes ago.

291
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,733
Who's lila?

292
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,467
His sponsor.

293
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:38,568
Really? A woman?

294
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:40,467
Yes, mom.

295
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:42,434
Dexter's sponsor
is a woman.

296
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:43,800
Is that a problem?

297
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,234
Is she attractive?

298
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:47,800
Mom -

299
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:51,367
I'm just curious.
Is she?

300
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:53,833
I have an idea.

301
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:56,800
Why don't you and lila
have dinner with us?

302
00:15:56,833 --> 00:16:00,467
Well, that's very kind of you,
gail, but, um...

303
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,000
i think it would be really nice
if we got to know the woman

304
00:16:03,034 --> 00:16:04,767
You've been spending
so much time with.

305
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,534
Look, mom,
they're doing step work.

306
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:09,867
But they have to eat,
right?

307
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:15,867
Oh, here. Let me help.

308
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,134
Thank you.

309
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,301
Mm-Hmm.

310
00:16:21,234 --> 00:16:24,367
So lovely of you
to have me over.

311
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:27,334
Now i can put names
to faces.

312
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:29,234
Dexter talks about you
all the time.

313
00:16:29,267 --> 00:16:32,301
Good things, i hope.

314
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:36,568
Dexter never says a bad word
about anyone.

315
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,900
Tell me, lila.

316
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:51,434
What exactly
are you recovering from?

317
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:53,934
I'm a meth addict -

318
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:56,134
Sober five years.

319
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:58,601
I don't know much
about meth.

320
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:00,700
Rita's ex-Husband
shot heroin.

321
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,301
Like dexter.

322
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:04,900
Guess we know your type,
don't we?

323
00:17:04,934 --> 00:17:08,301
Just can't seem to help myself.

324
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:10,900
Huh.

325
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:14,334
You have nothing to worry
about... with dexter, i mean.

326
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,301
I'm sitting right here.

327
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:19,900
I didn't mean to imply -

328
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:21,568
No.
I completely understand.

329
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:23,167
Rita's your little baby.

330
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,301
You have every right
to be concerned.

331
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:28,267
But if i can reassure you,

332
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:30,601
Dexter's doing
incredibly well.

333
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:34,534
Well,
i'm happy to hear that.

334
00:17:34,568 --> 00:17:37,034
And i'm sure it's got everything
to do with the two of you.

335
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:39,134
From what he tells me,
you're very supportive.

336
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:41,301
Dexter's lucky to have you.

337
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:45,067
Well... that's very sweet
of you to say.

338
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,767
So, lila, tell us more
about yourself.

339
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,267
Um, dexter tells me
you're an artist.

340
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:54,467
Yeah, she does amazing things
with a blowtorch.

341
00:17:54,501 --> 00:17:55,668
What's it called?

342
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,367
Uh, talent.

343
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:04,800
But i'm, uh... i'm not
the only artist at the table.

344
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,800
Dexter?

345
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,900
Since when?

346
00:18:09,934 --> 00:18:11,100
It's not really art.

347
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:13,401
She's talking
about a blood-Spatter pattern

348
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:14,767
She took from work.

349
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,833
What kind of career choice
is blood spatter, exactly?

350
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:21,367
He helps
catch criminals, mother.

351
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:24,867
And it makes
perfect sense, really -

352
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,967
What with dexter's mother
and everything.

353
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,501
You know...

354
00:18:32,534 --> 00:18:35,534
she's... dead.

355
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:42,367
Forgot the bread.

356
00:18:44,301 --> 00:18:46,134
Dinner was fantastic,
rita.

357
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,634
And this dessert -
Wow.

358
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:55,733
I never thought
i'd say this,

359
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,467
But i kind of like her.

360
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:59,568
Yeah, me too.

361
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:02,301
She's really helping me.

362
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:06,267
I wish she didn't have
to help you tonight.

363
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:08,267
Why?
What are you thinking?

364
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:10,833
Mmm, my mom
could watch the kids.

365
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:12,833
I have to swing by
the office tonight.

366
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:16,934
I need to take care
of something really important.

367
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:20,134
Oh, i mean, can't it wait
till morning?

368
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:22,467
I promise
we'll go straight to bed.

369
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:24,501
You're very convincing,

370
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:27,134
But it needs
to get done tonight.

371
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,234
Just give me an hour,
okay?

372
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:32,100
Meet you
back at my place?

373
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:33,401
Okay.

374
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:41,967
I still think it's funny
you write children's books.

375
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,601
Yeah, a big, tough guy
like me

376
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:46,534
Should be doing something manly,
huh, like wrangling cattle.

377
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:49,401
I don't even know
any kids' books.

378
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:52,501
My dad told me cop stories
before bed.

379
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:56,334
It was really the only alone
time i ever got with him.

380
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,067
You okay?

381
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,434
Yeah.

382
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:06,034
Sorry -
Just an annoying day at work.

383
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,267
You know that fbi guy
i was talking about?

384
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:16,201
I was really starting to feel
like i was his go-To girl,

385
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:17,967
But...

386
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,867
he realized dexter
is the superior morgan.

387
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,800
I should be used to it,
you know?

388
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,267
It was like that
with my dad, work.

389
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:28,367
I guess i just hoped with lundy
it would be different.

390
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:29,401
Why?

391
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:31,733
I don't know.

392
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:35,267
I respect him.

393
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:40,100
He's great at his job,
supersmart,

394
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:43,733
And, like, funny,
but in this really dry way

395
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:46,100
Where he doesn't even
know it.

396
00:20:46,134 --> 00:20:48,100
You love him.

397
00:20:48,134 --> 00:20:49,733
What?

398
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:51,401
No.

399
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:54,234
You do. You totally have a crush on grundy. Lundy.

400
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:56,134
Oh, now you're getting touchy
about it.

401
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,134
I don't have
a crush on him.

402
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,700
He's like my dad,
except i spent my whole life

403
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:02,700
Trying to get my dad
to notice me,

404
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:05,568
And he actually pays attention
to what i have to say.

405
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:07,267
And grundy loves you.

406
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:09,800
Oh, fuck off.

407
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,134
Lundy's good -

408
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,467
Double-Locked...

409
00:21:31,501 --> 00:21:34,301
and a bit beyond my expertise.

410
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,067
I could try to crack it open,

411
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,568
But in my own station...

412
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:40,367
too risky.

413
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:55,201
I can do this more often now
that my mom's in town.

414
00:21:55,234 --> 00:21:58,700
I feel
like we're being bad.

415
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:04,234
Bad - Bad is good.

416
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:08,000
Oh, let the machine
get it.

417
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:11,668
Hey, dex,
just calling to check in -

418
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,534
Thought we could do
the debriefing on dinner.

419
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:15,833
I thought it went well,
don't you?

420
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,100
Mmm. I'd say so.

421
00:22:17,134 --> 00:22:21,634
Rita's sweet -
Very martha stewart.

422
00:22:21,668 --> 00:22:23,301
I love martha stewart.

423
00:22:23,334 --> 00:22:24,568
God, her mum -

424
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:27,668
She's got quite the rod
up her ass, doesn't she?

425
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,034
By the way, i am such a twat.

426
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:31,401
I can't believe i almost
slipped up about your mum.

427
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:32,833
Mind you,
it could have been worse.

428
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:35,800
I could have spilled the beans
about our road trip.

429
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,668
Don't you dare!

430
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,568
Can you imagine rita's face
if i told her

431
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:42,034
That you and i had spent
the night together in a hotel?

432
00:22:42,067 --> 00:22:43,601
Anyway...

433
00:22:43,634 --> 00:22:46,434
you and lila stayed
in a hotel together?

434
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:48,067
We had adjoining rooms.

435
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,601
Adjoining rooms? Right.

436
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,234
God,
i am such an idiot.

437
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:52,934
I can't believe i defended you
to my mother

438
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:54,800
While you were off
sleeping with another woman.

439
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:55,900
Rita, wait.

440
00:22:55,934 --> 00:22:57,601
I thought
you were different than paul,

441
00:22:57,634 --> 00:22:58,934
But you're the same.

442
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:00,900
You know what?
Actually, you're worse.

443
00:23:00,934 --> 00:23:02,034
You made me trust you.

444
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,668
Rita, please,
will you just let me explain?

445
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,767
I've had it!

446
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,668
I have been patient
and understanding,

447
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,934
But there's only
so much i can take.

448
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:13,934
You're a liar and a cheat,
and i am through.

449
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:16,800
It's over, dexter.

450
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,733
Tracy jenkins was given
the liver

451
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:25,668
Of a 9-Year-Old
accident victim...

452
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,467
hi, honey.

453
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:30,534
I thought you were spending
the night at dexter's.

454
00:23:30,568 --> 00:23:32,100
We had a fight.

455
00:23:32,134 --> 00:23:33,800
I think we broke up.

456
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,067
What?

457
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:40,100
Oh. Shh.

458
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:52,334
Yesterday i was so hopeful -

459
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:54,767
A new me, a new life.

460
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,267
But a life without rita
seems strange.

461
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:03,501
What in the name of fuck
are you doing up so early?

462
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:05,534
I got to get
to the station.

463
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:20,668
Are you okay?

464
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:24,634
You seem weird -
Weirder than usual.

465
00:24:24,668 --> 00:24:27,767
Rita broke up with me
last night.

466
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,234
Seriously?

467
00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:34,800
What happened?

468
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:37,134
It's a long story.

469
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:38,767
I've got time.

470
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,568
Yeah... but i don't.

471
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:44,134
Cliff notes.

472
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:46,334
She thinks
i did something bad,

473
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:49,000
But i didn't.

474
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:50,833
Did you tell her that?

475
00:24:50,867 --> 00:24:52,467
I tried, but she dumped me

476
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:55,334
Before i had
a chance to explain.

477
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:58,100
She said, "it's over,"
and left.

478
00:24:58,134 --> 00:24:59,601
Well,
did you go after her?

479
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:00,833
Was i supposed to?

480
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,867
You're such a guy.

481
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,967
When i get pissed, i say stuff
i don't mean all the time -

482
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,167
"I hate you,"

483
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:07,634
"I faked it,"

484
00:25:07,668 --> 00:25:08,867
"You're hung like a grape. "

485
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
You lost me.

486
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:11,733
When rita said, "it's over,"

487
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:14,800
I'm sure she didn't
actually mean it's over.

488
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:18,467
Stop being a douche bag
and go fight for her.

489
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:20,000
She's fucking perfect.

490
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:22,301
I know.

491
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:32,601
Hello?

492
00:25:32,634 --> 00:25:34,234
Oh, hey.

493
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:37,201
Sure, i'll be right there.

494
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:42,067
Yeah. I'll tell him.

495
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,767
Bye.

496
00:25:47,267 --> 00:25:48,967
Who's that, gabriel?

497
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,167
No, lundy.

498
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:51,767
He's holding a meeting
at the station

499
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,601
About the bay harbor case.

500
00:25:54,634 --> 00:25:56,867
He specifically requested
that you be there.

501
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,234
I missed my window.
He's already seen the footage.

502
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,334
Me? Why?

503
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:03,867
Because you're
his new butt buddy.

504
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:08,000
You gonna be okay?

505
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:10,334
Check back with me later.

506
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:17,034
The show has already started,

507
00:26:17,067 --> 00:26:19,267
But have they seen
the feature presentation -

508
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:20,833
"Bane of
the bay harbor butcher,"

509
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:23,167
Starring dexter morgan
as himself?

510
00:26:23,201 --> 00:26:24,700
So, it's all synched up?

511
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:27,601
Yep, you can watch
streaming video of the marina

512
00:26:27,634 --> 00:26:29,201
Right now if you want to.

513
00:26:29,234 --> 00:26:32,367
Yeah. Maybe you'll get to see
some pontoon poon.

514
00:26:34,234 --> 00:26:37,267
Did you... need something?

515
00:26:37,301 --> 00:26:41,067
That's not my marina... yet.

516
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,201
I'll be making
my on-Screen debut soon enough.

517
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,501
I've got to figure out a way
to get to those video files.

518
00:26:45,534 --> 00:26:47,967
The media frenzy
about the bay harbor butcher

519
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,234
Has come back to bite us -
Big surprise.

520
00:26:50,267 --> 00:26:52,733
Now we've got a wannabe
vigilante out there

521
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:55,000
Who liked the butcher's style
and thought,

522
00:26:55,034 --> 00:26:58,900
"Hey, i should try this
at home. "

523
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:01,467
He attacked this man -
John henry,

524
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:04,167
Ex-Convict,
preyed on the elderly.

525
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:05,467
It gets better.

526
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:08,467
I have already received
reports of ads

527
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,934
On craigslist
and coffee-Shop bulletin boards

528
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:13,067
Requesting the services
of the butcher.

529
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,201
People think they've found
their own personal batman.

530
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:18,568
This is not good news.

531
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:20,267
If this kind of thing
catches on,

532
00:27:20,301 --> 00:27:21,467
We're looking at an epidemic.

533
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:22,733
Kind of like herpes.

534
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,401
Fucking-A, masuka,
i'm trying to listen.

535
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,634
One in four, morgan -
One in four.

536
00:27:26,668 --> 00:27:30,434
Vigilante justice is
domestic terrorism.

537
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:33,568
And terrorism prevention
is the fbi's top priority.

538
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:35,867
I have done my best
to be diplomatic,

539
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,601
But if we lose one life
to a vigilante,

540
00:27:39,634 --> 00:27:41,668
I will pull this case
from miami metro

541
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,634
And hand it over
in full to the bureau.

542
00:27:43,668 --> 00:27:45,767
That's a promise.

543
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,833
That's a disaster.
It'd be raining feds in miami.

544
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,634
So, if we want to keep
the investigation here,

545
00:27:51,668 --> 00:27:53,568
We need to nip this
in the bud,

546
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:56,334
Make an example
of our would-Be vigilante.

547
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:58,501
The last thing we need is
a bunch of weekend warriors -

548
00:27:58,534 --> 00:28:01,100
I think
i found a suspect.

549
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:05,267
Could you?

550
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,334
Ken olson.

551
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:13,000
Olson's mother
was hurt badly

552
00:28:13,034 --> 00:28:14,967
In a home-Invasion robbery.

553
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,733
Guess who hurt her.

554
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:19,767
Oh, please tell me john henry,
our train-Car victim.

555
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,067
I think olson attacked him
for revenge.

556
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,301
Any evidence?

557
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,501
Only circumstantial.

558
00:28:24,534 --> 00:28:26,000
Can you get him in here
for questioning?

559
00:28:26,034 --> 00:28:27,401
Can't find him.

560
00:28:27,434 --> 00:28:30,733
Okay. Leak this to some
of your media contacts.

561
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:32,201
Let's beat this guy
out of the bushes.

562
00:28:32,234 --> 00:28:33,334
Nice work, detective.

563
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:34,733
Let's get moving.

564
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:37,568
I need hard evidence on this
olson character, and fast.

565
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:40,301
And if you can find the guy,
even better.

566
00:28:40,334 --> 00:28:42,167
The full force of the fbi -

567
00:28:42,201 --> 00:28:43,934
That's the last thing i need.

568
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:45,800
I've got to make sure lundy
gets his man...

569
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:49,034
after i figure out a way
to erase the marina files

570
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:50,700
And make up
with my girlfriend.

571
00:28:50,733 --> 00:28:52,501
And then maybe i'll tackle
world hunger

572
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,434
Because things
can't really get much worse.

573
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:59,134
There's another shipment
coming in tomorrow.

574
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:00,234
Cocaine.

575
00:29:00,267 --> 00:29:01,534
How much?

576
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,733
300 bricks,
give or take.

577
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:05,167
Turn it off.

578
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,201
That wasn't part
of our agreement, harry.

579
00:29:07,234 --> 00:29:09,668
I said turn it off.

580
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,234
I heard what you said.

581
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,767
I just don't take orders
from you.

582
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,668
Is there a reason you're
in my lab, sergeant doakes?

583
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,401
Is there a reason
you're listening to tapes

584
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:19,568
As old as you are,
morgan?

585
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:23,434
I had a little talk
with your sister.

586
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:25,634
It turns out she didn't know
you were in program.

587
00:29:25,668 --> 00:29:28,034
Anonymous, sergeant.

588
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:29,733
How long did you say
you been clean?

589
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:32,967
Actually, i didn't, because it's
none of your goddamn business.

590
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,034
So, if i were to take
a hair from your desk

591
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:36,134
And run it for drugs,

592
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:38,201
It would come back
positive, right?

593
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,668
Because why would someone

594
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,000
Pretend to be an addict
if he's not...

595
00:29:42,034 --> 00:29:43,967
unless he's got something

596
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,434
A hell of a lot worse
to hide?

597
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:47,800
Back...

598
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:50,067
the fuck...

599
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,234
off.

600
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:54,767
You want to hit me?
Go for it.

601
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,434
I've been waiting for a chance
to take your ass out.

602
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:01,601
I know how you feel,
sergeant.

603
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:19,401
I want to file a formal
complaint against doakes.

604
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,501
Jesus, dexter,
the two of you -

605
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:23,034
He crossed the line,
lieutenant.

606
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:24,267
He broke into my lab.

607
00:30:24,301 --> 00:30:27,067
He went through my personal
things. He threatened me.

608
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,967
He's probably gonna start
tailing me again.

609
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,767
Sergeant doakes tailed you?

610
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,367
For weeks, maybe longer.

611
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:37,800
Okay, you have every right
to file a complaint,

612
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:39,034
But before you do that,

613
00:30:39,067 --> 00:30:41,434
I'd like the chance
to talk to james myself.

614
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:43,934
He's really not much
of a talker.

615
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,900
I'm asking you, as a personal
favor to me, to hold off.

616
00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:49,767
Can you do that?

617
00:30:51,134 --> 00:30:52,568
Yeah.

618
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,833
Okay, in the meantime,
i strongly encourage you

619
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:58,568
To take a break
for a couple of hours.

620
00:30:58,601 --> 00:31:00,267
Just go somewhere.
Cool off.

621
00:31:00,301 --> 00:31:01,501
No.

622
00:31:01,534 --> 00:31:02,634
Excuse me?

623
00:31:02,668 --> 00:31:04,201
I need to be here,
lieutenant.

624
00:31:04,234 --> 00:31:06,467
This is really not a good time
for me to leave.

625
00:31:06,501 --> 00:31:08,867
It isn't a suggestion, dexter.
It's an order.

626
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,634
Clear the station.
Clear your head.

627
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,634
I don't want to see you here
until after lunch.

628
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,267
Understood?

629
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,034
Blimey, look at you.

630
00:31:51,568 --> 00:31:53,501
You want to tell me
what's going on?

631
00:31:53,534 --> 00:31:55,833
What's going on?

632
00:31:55,867 --> 00:31:58,967
Being the new me sucks.

633
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,501
I'm about to be found out
at work for what i am -

634
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:04,000
For what i really am.

635
00:32:04,034 --> 00:32:05,934
And i can't do anything
to stop it

636
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,800
Because i got kicked
out of the office to cool off.

637
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:10,934
Well, that seems to be
going well for you.

638
00:32:10,967 --> 00:32:14,000
Add to that the fact
that rita heard your message

639
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:15,568
And dumped me last night.

640
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,634
I tried to explain to her
that nothing happened,

641
00:32:17,668 --> 00:32:19,067
But she wouldn't listen
to me.

642
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,434
Nobody fucking listens
to me.

643
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:22,000
Listen, you need
to calm down, okay?

644
00:32:22,034 --> 00:32:24,733
Last time i saw you like this,
you came back covered in blood.

645
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:26,401
So?

646
00:32:26,434 --> 00:32:28,900
You're the one who said i'm
supposed to feel my feelings.

647
00:32:28,934 --> 00:32:31,401
Well, now i'm telling you
to get them under control.

648
00:32:31,434 --> 00:32:32,800
You don't understand.

649
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:34,467
Why don't you make me?

650
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,501
Which step was that?

651
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,601
The naughty one.

652
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:49,501
What are you thinking?

653
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,367
Absolutely nothing.

654
00:33:58,467 --> 00:34:03,267
I guess we found a way to quiet
the voices in your head.

655
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:05,367
I guess so.

656
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:13,067
How do you feel?

657
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,067
Much better, actually.

658
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,668
I guess i must be
a good sponsor after all.

659
00:34:24,601 --> 00:34:26,201
Definitely.

660
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,367
And where are you
off to?

661
00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:40,434
I still have that thing at work
to deal with.

662
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:42,867
Well, come back tomorrow.

663
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,833
I promise you
some serious recovery.

664
00:34:55,568 --> 00:34:56,668
Hello?

665
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,700
Dexter, hey.

666
00:34:58,733 --> 00:34:59,800
You at work?

667
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:02,668
Uh, i will be soon.

668
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,167
I was just taking a break.

669
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:07,134
What's going on?

670
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:09,334
I'd really like
to get together and talk.

671
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:11,534
I don't like our last
conversation ended.

672
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,100
Me neither.

673
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:14,900
You said you wanted
to explain,

674
00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:16,934
And i owe it to you
to hear you out.

675
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:18,301
I owe it to us.

676
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:20,434
Oh.

677
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:22,634
Wow, okay.

678
00:35:22,668 --> 00:35:26,367
So, can you come over
after work?

679
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:28,967
Sure.

680
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,534
Great.

681
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:34,934
Apparently my new life
involves a love triangle.

682
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,501
I'm that guy.

683
00:35:37,534 --> 00:35:40,733
The voices are back -
Excellent.

684
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:51,067
James!

685
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,833
You were tailing dexter?

686
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,534
What the hell
were you thinking?

687
00:35:54,568 --> 00:35:56,601
If you wanted to have lunch,
you could have asked.

688
00:35:56,634 --> 00:35:58,367
If dexter files a complaint,

689
00:35:58,401 --> 00:36:01,434
You will be kicked
off the force, end of story.

690
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:04,634
There's a reason he hasn't
reported me until now.

691
00:36:04,668 --> 00:36:06,501
He's hiding something, maria.
I can feel it.

692
00:36:06,534 --> 00:36:08,833
Is this another one
of your conspiracy theories?

693
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:11,467
It's instinct and a hell
of a lot of experience.

694
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:14,167
I've spent years looking
the enemy in the face,

695
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:17,134
And i'm telling you
morgan is dangerous.

696
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:20,833
Your instincts haven't been
that great these days, james.

697
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:23,401
Two shootings
in the last six months,

698
00:36:23,434 --> 00:36:25,234
Stalking
a police employee -

699
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:26,334
Listen to me.

700
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:31,201
Morgan lied
about the ice-Truck killer.

701
00:36:31,234 --> 00:36:33,401
That crack pipe knew
way more than he ever told us.

702
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:34,934
He was trying
to protect his sister.

703
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:36,634
You of all people
should understand that.

704
00:36:36,668 --> 00:36:38,134
I followed him
to an n. A. Meeting.

705
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:39,634
That asshole
lied about that, too.

706
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:42,967
You're obsessed.
I'm not.

707
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,700
You are,
and i need you to see it...

708
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:47,700
as your boss
and as your friend.

709
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:50,367
We've been
through this before,

710
00:36:50,401 --> 00:36:52,668
And last time it cost you
our relationship.

711
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,601
This time it's gonna get you
kicked off the force or worse.

712
00:36:56,634 --> 00:36:57,967
I'll take my chances.

713
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,234
Let it go.

714
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:05,900
I mean it.

715
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:08,568
Leave dexter alone.

716
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:18,733
The batista suspect
come in yet -

717
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:19,967
The wannabe vigilante?

718
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,067
Olson just came in -
Saw himself on the 3:00 news

719
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,733
And showed up
with his lawyer.

720
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:28,534
I hope we nail his ass
to the wall.

721
00:37:28,568 --> 00:37:30,800
I love it
when you talk dirty.

722
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:35,634
Morgan.

723
00:37:35,668 --> 00:37:36,668
Right here.

724
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,568
Oh, the other morgan.

725
00:37:38,601 --> 00:37:42,601
I didn't know
you were a smoker. Hmm.

726
00:37:45,134 --> 00:37:47,067
Have you seen
dexter morgan?

727
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,934
Oh, he's on a break.
Why?

728
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,434
Detective batista's got
a suspect in interview room one.

729
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:53,167
We think
he's the would-Be vigilante

730
00:37:53,201 --> 00:37:54,800
Who attacked
our train-Car victim.

731
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:57,067
I need morgan to take
some scrapings for evidence.

732
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,767
You want to use
dexter again?

733
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,568
Isn't masuka
on your task force?

734
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:05,267
Yes, he is.

735
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,900
So, mr. Olson,

736
00:38:08,934 --> 00:38:11,167
The man who assaulted your mom
was attacked yesterday.

737
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:12,334
Did you know that?

738
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:13,568
Nope.

739
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:15,067
Can't say
i'm upset, though -

740
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,967
Son of a bitch
almost killed my mom.

741
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,668
My client's emotional,
detective.

742
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,634
I'm sure he's not trying
to say he's -

743
00:38:20,668 --> 00:38:21,800
Any idea
who might have done it?

744
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,833
I don't know.
Maybe it was the butcher.

745
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:27,167
If you ask me,
a guy like that

746
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:29,668
Should be running the police
force, not hiding from it.

747
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,034
Is this a lion
or a hippo?

748
00:38:31,067 --> 00:38:34,067
I think it's a lion.

749
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,967
Tastes like a hippo.

750
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,201
Animal cracker?

751
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:39,934
No, thank you.

752
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:43,700
What do you do for a living,
mr. Olson?

753
00:38:43,733 --> 00:38:45,800
I just lost my job.

754
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:47,833
That's too bad.

755
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,800
I see that you have
a minor assault record

756
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:53,367
And no alibi
for yesterday morning.

757
00:38:53,401 --> 00:38:55,733
I'm sure my client didn't
realize he needed one.

758
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,501
Do you have a girlfriend,
mr. Olson?

759
00:38:57,534 --> 00:38:59,700
She just broke up
with me.

760
00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:01,100
Why, you interested?

761
00:39:01,134 --> 00:39:03,034
Just curious.

762
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:04,401
Now, this is a lion.

763
00:39:05,434 --> 00:39:09,434
All right, let me
keep this all straight.

764
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:12,034
No job, no relationship.

765
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:14,767
You got guns
and a minor assault record.

766
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,267
And i voted for george bush
both times.

767
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:18,668
I'm sorry, detective,
were you getting at something?

768
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,733
What he's getting at,
mr. Novik,

769
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:22,833
Is that your client
fits the four-Point profile

770
00:39:22,867 --> 00:39:25,067
Of someone who'd commit
a vigilante offense.

771
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,634
I think you're
a ticking time bomb.

772
00:39:26,668 --> 00:39:29,234
You ask me,
you just needed a reason

773
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,201
To take the law
into your own hands.

774
00:39:31,234 --> 00:39:33,634
And the butcher
was the perfect excuse.

775
00:39:33,668 --> 00:39:34,634
You don't know me.

776
00:39:34,668 --> 00:39:36,367
We know
you attacked john henry.

777
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:39,601
You need proof to make those
kinds of accusations, detective.

778
00:39:40,668 --> 00:39:43,800
You heard the man, detective.
We've got work to do.

779
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:46,034
Make yourself comfortable,
mr. Olson.

780
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:48,234
We're just getting started
with you.

781
00:39:58,534 --> 00:40:01,100
That's my marina.

782
00:40:01,134 --> 00:40:05,234
And in less than 30 minutes,
i'll be on that screen.

783
00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:09,367
I need to take care of this,
and fast.

784
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:11,401
I'm out of time.

785
00:40:11,434 --> 00:40:15,634
I need an idea, a sign,
anything.

786
00:40:15,668 --> 00:40:18,601
What would the old dexter do?

787
00:40:21,134 --> 00:40:24,534
Definitely not that.

788
00:40:25,867 --> 00:40:27,534
No security cameras.

789
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:36,467
Apparently the new dexter's
stuck in high school.

790
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,000
Maybe i am a late bloomer.

791
00:40:43,634 --> 00:40:45,733
A fire drill?
Are you kidding?

792
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:47,000
We have work to do.

793
00:40:47,034 --> 00:40:49,668
It's probably one of those kids
in the bullpen.

794
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,967
It's something
i would have done.

795
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:53,733
Well, at least
it stopped raining.

796
00:41:16,334 --> 00:41:18,234
All clear. Everybody out.

797
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,267
All clear! Everybody out!

798
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,434
Respect the vest.

799
00:41:24,467 --> 00:41:27,000
Don't make me take out my hose.

800
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,301
Like it never happened.

801
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,833
If only the rest of life
were so easy to figure out.

802
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:45,733
Hey, where you headed?

803
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:47,668
I figured you'd be first in line
to check out the firemen.

804
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,401
I have to arrange
protective custody

805
00:41:49,434 --> 00:41:51,267
For that piece-Of-Shit
train-Car victim.

806
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:52,334
Why?

807
00:41:52,367 --> 00:41:53,601
Because we have nothing
on olson -

808
00:41:53,634 --> 00:41:56,067
Not even enough to get a warrant
to search his place.

809
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,034
Is that olson's file?

810
00:41:59,067 --> 00:42:00,534
If we don't
get something soon,

811
00:42:00,568 --> 00:42:01,833
Lundy's gonna have
to let him go,

812
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:04,000
Which means olson's
gonna kill again,

813
00:42:04,034 --> 00:42:06,668
Which means we lose the bay
harbor butcher case to the fbi,

814
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,867
Which means we're all fucked.

815
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,201
Some more than others.

816
00:42:09,234 --> 00:42:10,201
No shit.

817
00:42:10,234 --> 00:42:11,668
Till lundy showed up,

818
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,601
I just felt like the dipshit who
slept with the ice-Truck killer.

819
00:42:14,634 --> 00:42:17,800
If he pulls the plug, i go back
to being the resident retard.

820
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,167
Chin up,
little sister -

821
00:42:19,201 --> 00:42:22,134
These things have a way
of working themselves out.

822
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:36,867
I just have to find
a piece of evidence

823
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,668
To make sure lundy
catches olson fair and square.

824
00:43:14,367 --> 00:43:17,467
Looks like i have a fan club,
membership of one.

825
00:43:35,434 --> 00:43:37,234
Why you so interested
in the bay harbor butcher?

826
00:43:37,267 --> 00:43:39,601
Who the fuck are you?

827
00:43:39,634 --> 00:43:42,434
Holy shit, you're him,
aren't you?

828
00:43:42,467 --> 00:43:45,601
Stop. Stop.
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

829
00:43:45,634 --> 00:43:48,700
I'm like you.
I take out criminals.

830
00:43:48,733 --> 00:43:51,201
You mean you try...
pitifully.

831
00:43:51,234 --> 00:43:53,568
No, that was
just the last one.

832
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:54,800
He got away.

833
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:57,034
I should have never
made it personal.

834
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:58,234
You've killed others?

835
00:43:58,267 --> 00:43:59,634
That's what i'm trying
to tell you.

836
00:43:59,668 --> 00:44:03,367
First was a drug dealer -
I ran him down with my car.

837
00:44:03,401 --> 00:44:06,501
It felt -
It felt fucking great,

838
00:44:06,534 --> 00:44:10,167
Even better than the free stash
i got off him.

839
00:44:10,201 --> 00:44:12,334
And then this guy at work

840
00:44:12,367 --> 00:44:14,000
Found out
i was fucking his wife.

841
00:44:14,034 --> 00:44:15,568
He started to beat on her,

842
00:44:15,601 --> 00:44:17,833
So i pushed him
down a stairwell.

843
00:44:17,867 --> 00:44:20,401
The cops thought it was
an accident, but it was me.

844
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:24,034
See, you can't kill me.

845
00:44:24,067 --> 00:44:25,568
I wasn't going to...

846
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:30,267
until now.

847
00:44:42,634 --> 00:44:45,833
This is what the kill room
should look like -

848
00:44:45,867 --> 00:44:49,800
The inside
of a big plastic bag.

849
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:53,201
Of course, i spent hours working
in this train car yesterday,

850
00:44:53,234 --> 00:44:57,434
So i'm not too worried
about trace evidence.

851
00:44:57,467 --> 00:45:00,434
To your credit,
your location was well chosen.

852
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:03,967
It just needed
a little cleaning, a few lights,

853
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,034
Proper tools, of course.

854
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:08,034
I did it because of you.

855
00:45:08,067 --> 00:45:10,900
No.

856
00:45:10,934 --> 00:45:13,301
You attacked those people
because you wanted to.

857
00:45:13,334 --> 00:45:14,767
Yeah,
but you inspired me...

858
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,700
i didn't.
... with your principles.

859
00:45:16,733 --> 00:45:17,900
They're not my principles.

860
00:45:17,934 --> 00:45:19,401
Of course they are.

861
00:45:19,434 --> 00:45:20,900
Don't tell me who i am.

862
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,833
My whole life, i've done what
someone else said i should do,

863
00:45:24,867 --> 00:45:26,367
Been who he said
i should be.

864
00:45:26,401 --> 00:45:28,401
I followed his rules.
I stuck to his plan.

865
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,900
I never stopped to think

866
00:45:29,934 --> 00:45:32,301
About what i wanted
and what i needed.

867
00:45:32,334 --> 00:45:36,367
And now i don't know
who i'm supposed to be.

868
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:38,267
I'll tell you
one thing, though.

869
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:40,134
I'm not
the bay harbor butcher.

870
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:42,467
I'm certainly not
anybody's role model.

871
00:45:42,501 --> 00:45:45,167
What are you talking about,
then? Who are you?

872
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:47,967
I'll let you know
when i figure that out.

873
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,201
Though, i got to tell you,

874
00:45:50,234 --> 00:45:51,867
I am well on my way,

875
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,934
Because, as sure
as i'm standing here,

876
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:56,167
I don't need to kill you.

877
00:45:56,201 --> 00:45:57,401
That's a relief.

878
00:45:57,434 --> 00:45:59,301
I mean that need
that comes from within

879
00:45:59,334 --> 00:46:01,733
That always drives me
to this table -

880
00:46:01,767 --> 00:46:03,534
I don't feel it.

881
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:09,034
I'm in recovery.

882
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:11,167
Well, i mean, i knew
you weren't gonna kill me.

883
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,934
No, i'm gonna kill you.
I have to.

884
00:46:12,967 --> 00:46:15,234
I just don't need to.

885
00:46:15,267 --> 00:46:16,401
It's very empowering.

886
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,634
Anyone in there,
make yourself known!

887
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,134
Arm.

888
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:01,700
Leg.

889
00:47:01,733 --> 00:47:04,867
Head.

890
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,800
It's olson,
gift-Wrapped.

891
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:10,401
It would seem the butcher
is watching us,

892
00:47:10,434 --> 00:47:12,267
Tracking
the investigation.

893
00:47:12,301 --> 00:47:13,833
That wouldn't be
too hard to do.

894
00:47:13,867 --> 00:47:16,601
But why'd he leave the victim's
body for us? That's a first.

895
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:18,234
Probably didn't take
too kindly

896
00:47:18,267 --> 00:47:20,034
To the idea of olson
imitating him.

897
00:47:20,067 --> 00:47:22,967
It's a pretty good way to
discourage others, don't you think?

898
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,267
I hate to say it, but he
probably did us a favor.

899
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:27,100
You take the law
into your own hands,

900
00:47:27,134 --> 00:47:29,100
The bay harbor boogeyman's
gonna get you.

901
00:47:29,134 --> 00:47:31,367
This is the first time
we've set foot in a place

902
00:47:31,401 --> 00:47:33,501
Where the bay harbor butcher's
actually been.

903
00:47:33,534 --> 00:47:34,900
Let's get busy.

904
00:47:41,934 --> 00:47:43,434
Anybody seen lundy?

905
00:47:43,467 --> 00:47:45,100
Over there on the phone.

906
00:47:45,134 --> 00:47:46,967
He's talking to d. C.,
i think.

907
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,634
Oh, shit. Is he gonna
pull the case from us?

908
00:47:54,534 --> 00:47:56,334
Sure,
have robinson call me.

909
00:47:56,367 --> 00:47:57,634
He's got my cell.

910
00:47:59,534 --> 00:48:01,700
I came over here to get
some privacy, officer morgan.

911
00:48:01,733 --> 00:48:02,800
Well, sorry.

912
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:04,234
Too much background noise
over there.

913
00:48:04,267 --> 00:48:06,767
Hearing's the first thing
to go.

914
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,934
Or is it memory?
I always forget.

915
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:10,301
You gonna pull
the case from us?

916
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:12,034
You said
if anybody died -

917
00:48:12,067 --> 00:48:14,034
At the hands
of a vigilante.

918
00:48:14,067 --> 00:48:15,568
This was our killer.

919
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,434
I'm afraid
you're still stuck with me.

920
00:48:17,467 --> 00:48:19,301
Will your brother
be here tomorrow?

921
00:48:20,634 --> 00:48:24,234
Yeah, i think so.

922
00:48:24,267 --> 00:48:26,700
I'll tell him you want him
within shouting distance.

923
00:48:26,733 --> 00:48:28,067
Hey...

924
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,967
what just happened?

925
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,067
No, it's cool.

926
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,800
He's always been
the family superstar.

927
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:35,668
Who? Dexter, your new go-To guy.

928
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,867
Oh, this isn't about dexter.

929
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,833
It's about masuka.
I can't stand him.

930
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:42,534
If i hear
one more titty joke,

931
00:48:42,568 --> 00:48:44,201
I'm afraid
i'll punch him in the face.

932
00:48:44,234 --> 00:48:46,134
Really?

933
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:49,900
Any north unit,
request has been made

934
00:48:49,934 --> 00:48:53,568
For 42 escort
from orange belt to j. M.S.

935
00:49:01,234 --> 00:49:03,934
Hey.

936
00:49:03,967 --> 00:49:06,467
Come on in.

937
00:49:06,501 --> 00:49:08,501
Sit down.

938
00:49:13,668 --> 00:49:16,601
I was angry before
when you tried to explain.

939
00:49:16,634 --> 00:49:18,234
This time i'll listen.

940
00:49:21,568 --> 00:49:25,700
I'm sorry i didn't tell you
about the road trip.

941
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:29,201
Lila...

942
00:49:29,234 --> 00:49:31,800
came with me to naples...

943
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:33,267
as my sponsor.

944
00:49:33,301 --> 00:49:34,401
That's all.

945
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:37,134
Why would you need her
in naples?

946
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:39,700
You remember
when i went out of town?

947
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:42,367
I went to find the man
who killed my mother.

948
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:44,700
What are you talking about?

949
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:47,800
A lot of stuff has been
coming up for me in recovery,

950
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:50,134
Things i never thought
i'd deal with.

951
00:49:52,067 --> 00:49:56,034
I watched my mother die
when i was 3.

952
00:49:56,067 --> 00:49:59,733
Oh, dexter...

953
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:01,134
i'm so sorry.

954
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:04,800
She was murdered
in front of me.

955
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:07,367
I saw it happen.

956
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,401
I think that has
a lot to do

957
00:50:11,434 --> 00:50:12,733
With why i'm...

958
00:50:14,401 --> 00:50:17,401
why i do the things i do.

959
00:50:17,434 --> 00:50:20,934
Of course.
Of course, it makes sense.

960
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:24,668
I found the man who killed her
in naples.

961
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,401
I thought maybe
if i talked to him,

962
00:50:26,434 --> 00:50:31,134
I could find
some kind of closure.

963
00:50:31,167 --> 00:50:34,034
That's why lila came with me -
For support.

964
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:36,634
Oh.

965
00:50:36,668 --> 00:50:38,234
What?

966
00:50:38,267 --> 00:50:42,833
This was a huge moment
in your life, dexter...

967
00:50:42,867 --> 00:50:47,467
and you chose to include lila
but not me.

968
00:50:47,501 --> 00:50:48,900
She's my sponsor.

969
00:50:48,934 --> 00:50:50,234
And i'm your girlfriend.

970
00:50:50,267 --> 00:50:53,634
I was afraid
you wouldn't understand.

971
00:50:58,401 --> 00:51:00,167
Okay.

972
00:51:02,467 --> 00:51:03,833
Okay.

973
00:51:03,867 --> 00:51:07,234
So, let me try
to understand now.

974
00:51:09,034 --> 00:51:12,334
You and lila
went away together

975
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:16,467
As sponsor and sponsee.

976
00:51:16,501 --> 00:51:19,867
And you really did have
adjoining rooms.

977
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,601
Yes.

978
00:51:21,634 --> 00:51:23,967
So, you didn't have sex
that night?

979
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,967
No.

980
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,301
Okay.

981
00:51:31,733 --> 00:51:33,267
Not that night.

982
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:39,334
Leave.

983
00:51:40,934 --> 00:51:43,000
Rita...

984
00:51:43,034 --> 00:51:45,201
no, please.

985
00:51:45,234 --> 00:51:47,301
Leave now.

986
00:52:03,134 --> 00:52:04,434
There was a time

987
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:06,867
I would have done anything
to protect rita.

988
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,401
I would have even lied.

989
00:52:09,434 --> 00:52:12,234
But today i told the truth...

990
00:52:12,267 --> 00:52:15,601
even though i knew
she'd get hurt.

991
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:27,167
Maybe i am leaving
the old me behind.
