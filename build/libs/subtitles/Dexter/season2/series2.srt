1
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:03,877
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:08,924
I'm on edge. 38 days have passed
since I killed my brother.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,510
In that entire time,
I haven't had a single night to myself.

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,637
Sergeant Doakes makes sure of that.

5
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,640
With Doakes tailing me,
my life's been all Jekyll and no Hyde.

6
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,392
My brother would be so disappointed.

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,186
Don't forget,
tell the universe what you need.

8
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,897
I really need...to kill somebody.

9
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,941
I've been waiting a long time for this.

10
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,116
What the fuck?

11
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:37,703
I'll be OK. I followed the code.
The stalk was good.

12
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,456
I'm just a little rusty
since killing my brother.

13
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,625
Debra can't sleep
in an empty house any more.

14
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,336
I guess that's what happens
when your fianc? tries to slice you up

15
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,255
into small, bloodless pieces.

16
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,923
Welcome back, Morgan.

17
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,967
Thanks.

18
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,429
You just got to look her in the eyes
to know she's not right.

19
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,098
- Excuse me, are you...
- What the fuck are you doing?

20
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,894
Rita, I'm not doing real good in here, OK?
Will you help me?

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,896
I found the fucking shoe, OK?

22
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,898
Great! I'll call the lawyer in the morning.

23
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,901
No! I'm not gonna let you
drag Dexter into this.

24
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,780
Paul's dead.

25
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,199
And I could have helped him.

26
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,992
That was his own fault.

27
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,995
Was it?

28
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:25,334
- What's the matter with you today?
- I'm just a little off my game. I'll get it back.

29
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,710
Rafael!

30
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,838
- It felt like she was asking me something.
- That's her son.

31
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,800
She says she knows who killed him,
Some guy named Little Chino.

32
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,469
She wants you to find Little Chino
and kill him like a dog.

33
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,012
Eva.

34
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,806
Are you willing to testify

35
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,643
that Little Chino picked up your son
on the night of his death?

36
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,311
Come on. Don't back down now.

37
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,107
I want him to pay.

38
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,276
A challenge, a mountain to climb.

39
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,070
I need this one.

40
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,824
The scene of the failed crime,
no better place to try again.

41
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,831
I don't normally experience failure.

42
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:08,418
39 days, 22 hours and 18 minutes
since I killed my brother.

43
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,170
I am cursed.

44
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,673
Two treasure hunters
made a ghastly discovery today

45
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,676
when they stumbled on what appears to be
an underwater graveyard

46
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,762
in a crevice off the coast of Miami.

47
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,350
That means there might be
a new mass murderer out there

48
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,727
way worse than the Ice-Truck Killer.

49
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,643
I'm drifting.

50
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,315
I finally get a chance to kill and I can't do it.

51
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,945
And a second chance, and he gets away.

52
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,953
And now all my secrets
are floating to the surface.

53
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,001
Where is the orderly,
controlled, effective Dexter?

54
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,211
How did I lose him?

55
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,422
How do I find him again?

56
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,676
I'm drifting...

57
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,139
...but not to sleep.

58
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,439
...the gruesome discovery
off the coast of Florida yesterday.

59
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,568
Police are still searching through evidence
lying at the bottom of the ocean.

60
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,864
Sources say there could be multiple victims
in what appears to be the work...

61
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,554
Here I am, back in the belly of the beast.

62
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,808
But how can I solve a crime when
I can't even solve what's wrong with me?

63
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,645
Yet duty calls.

64
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,445
Eight confirmed.

65
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,782
- Eight confirmed. Here?
- No. Here is just one.

66
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,159
Eight confirmed victims
of the Bay Harbor Butcher.

67
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,788
The "Bay Harbor Butcher"?

68
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,500
That's what the press is calling
whoever dumped those bodies offshore.

69
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,502
Has a nice ring to it, no?

70
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,670
Well, it's a little...

71
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,507
- lurid.
- Lurid and possibly wrong.

72
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,968
Part of me is hoping they found
the Ice-Truck Killer's dumping grounds.

73
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,222
Tell me about it. The last thing Miami needs is
another serial killer.

74
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,060
Eva Arenas. All she wanted was justice

75
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,188
against the 29th Street Kings
for whacking her son.

76
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:41,274
- First she's the messenger...
- Now she's a goddamn message.

77
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,905
Death by machete. Again.

78
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:51,660
We got a bolo on Little Chino. Gang crash
unit, all local patrols after that cabr?n.

79
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,831
Last thing I want is for the cops
to bring Little Chino in.

80
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,249
He's mine.

81
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,544
Why don't you take a picture, Morgan?
It'll last longer.

82
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,380
What would I do
without you, Sergeant?

83
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,309
Please, se?ora. Please, slower.

84
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,022
She's saying you fuckin' cops
don't do nothin'.

85
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,774
Grandma really talks like that?

86
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,278
Not exactly. But you get the point.
Right, bitch?

87
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,702
Fucking people don't want our help.

88
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,373
Shit. She had a little girl.

89
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,541
I know.

90
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,712
This stuff never gets to you?

91
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,799
I'm more of a "crying on the inside"
kind of guy.

92
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:51,470
Wow. He makes the Ice-Truck Killer
look like a goddamn artist.

93
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,310
Sorry, Morgan.

94
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,061
What?

95
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,605
I'm so over that.

96
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,066
You just prove it to me.

97
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,568
You can't.

98
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,404
You're just fucking with me!

99
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,867
I'm gonna have to put you on hold.

100
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,413
Fianc?.

101
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,541
Incarnate. Couldn't pick a worse time, right?

102
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,919
Hey, Esmee.

103
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,047
How about you take off,
let me handle this?

104
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,843
I couldn't let you do that.

105
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,597
I'll write up the report and email it to you
for signature.

106
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,890
OK?

107
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:47,108
I want Morgan to report to me first thing
in the morning about that bar fight of hers.

108
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,610
Maria...

109
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,862
I owe you.

110
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,249
In there!

111
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,170
Somebody else get in there now!

112
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,770
Mommy!

113
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,527
Seeing her mother that way.

114
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,613
Can you imagine that?

115
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,157
I can't even go there, Angel.

116
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,008
This one's on us, man.

117
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:57,762
If I had killed Chino last night,
that little girl's mother would still be alive.

118
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,950
I gotta find Chino before he finds me.

119
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,374
...bringing to an even dozen
the number of bodies found offshore.

120
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,877
I have to focus, tune everything out.

121
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,130
So far, the authorities
have no clue as to the criminal.

122
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:36,885
If I don't, being linked to my bodies of work
will be the least of my worries.

123
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,347
Shit. Little Chino?

124
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,475
He was out there.
The timing could be better.

125
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,855
Yeah, plus I don't have my tools.

126
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,443
It does give me the chance
to tie up one massive loose end.

127
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,043
- It's you, Sergeant.
- Who else you got following you?

128
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,837
Apparently no one.

129
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,886
Go ahead. Try it. I've been waiting.

130
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,889
This neighborhood...

131
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,724
it's full of crazies.

132
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,395
I'd lock my doors.

133
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,203
Bathroom's all yours.

134
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,372
Kind of always was.

135
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,338
We run out of glasses?

136
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,715
Clean ones.

137
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:01,136
Come here a sec. I found a couple of places
on craigslist you should check out.

138
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,013
Got two bedrooms, two baths,
limited water views,

139
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,266
- has its own gym.
- Hate it.

140
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,268
All right.

141
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,312
One bedroom, one bath,
Art Deco building.

142
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,148
Shitty neighborhood.

143
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,151
It gets morning sun.

144
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,611
Come on, Deb, give it a chance.

145
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,532
I appreciate the brotherly love,
but I've got the lieutenant in like an hour.

146
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,034
See you at the job.

147
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,163
I will not kill my sister,

148
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,249
I will not kill my sister,
I will not kill my sister.

149
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,018
- Hey, you.
- Dexter?

150
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,772
Astor? Sweetie, what's the matter?

151
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,982
Mom's acting all weird and stuff.

152
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:00,528
- What kind of weird?
- She keeps talking to people on the phone

153
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,406
about my dad,
then she starts yelling at them.

154
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,701
- Then she yells at me and Cody.
- I'm on my way.

155
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,248
No, no.
Calm is what I was 35 minutes ago.

156
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,125
Pissed is what I am now.

157
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,212
Hey, who wants Eggos?

158
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,756
I got blueberry or chocolate. Or both.

159
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,050
- Both.
- Don't care.

160
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,222
Assholes. They did everything but help.

161
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,849
Which assholes were you talking to?

162
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,645
Funeral home assholes.

163
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,523
You're having a funeral for Paul?

164
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,235
For Paul, for the kids, for me.

165
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,362
We had this old insurance policy.

166
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,906
It's about $5,000,
but it should cover everything.

167
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,534
You know, the county
will bury Paul for free.

168
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,411
I mean, he wasn't even your husband.

169
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,038
Any more.

170
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,873
Technically.

171
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,920
Then you could use the insurance money
for a starter scholarship for the kids?

172
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,550
Dexter, I didn't ask for your help
or your advice.

173
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,639
I'll never understand
how people deal with death,

174
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,059
why they can't just put it in its place.

175
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,939
And now I have to find someone
who knows I'm looking for him,

176
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:21,860
not exactly ideal in
the "element of surprise" department.

177
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:25,655
And I have to find a new way
to dispose of Little Chino's body.

178
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,783
If I can close the deal this time.

179
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,001
You totally douched me in there.

180
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,422
You clocked a guy in a bar
who touched your arm.

181
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,133
I told the lieutenant
you weren't ready for active duty.

182
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:49,262
Well, thank you
for the fucking vote of confidence.

183
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,347
Nice.

184
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,309
13 confirmed.

185
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,312
The buzz in the halls
is that the feds are coming in

186
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,814
- on the Bay Harbor bodies.
- Well, that figures.

187
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,359
The FBI does all the heavy lifting,
Captain Matthews takes all the credit.

188
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,362
Nice political move
when you're bucking for Deputy Chief.

189
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,157
- Any idea who the FBI is sending?
- Some guy named Lundy.

190
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,783
Frank Lundy?

191
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,536
He's a rock star.
The Green River Killer, the DC Sniper.

192
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,122
- If the case was impossible, he broke it.
- Now, James,

193
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,041
I'm damaged goods around here, but you,

194
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,128
you should do whatever you can
to get on Lundy's task force.

195
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,672
- It's a career-maker!
- Hey.

196
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,220
Just visualize that door of opportunity opening
up wide for you, bro,

197
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:35,099
- and just walk right through it.
- Angel, you keep up with this woo-woo shit,

198
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,602
I'm gonna walk right through you.

199
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,230
You were right.

200
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,483
Little Chino. Shit.

201
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,028
This guy is officially the highest point
in all of Florida.

202
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,201
What is he doing here?

203
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,663
People tell me you're looking for my client.

204
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,170
People tell you right.

205
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,845
Fuck, he's big.

206
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,264
The harder they fall.

207
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,394
That come with a story?

208
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,897
- I cut myself shaving.
- Well, you should be more careful, amigo.

209
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,775
Lieutenant, my client has been
harassed by this department.

210
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,194
- We're considering...
- Oh, cut the shit, Raul.

211
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,781
There was another murder in East Kendall
yesterday and my client...

212
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:35,743
Word on the pavement is
you're looking for me regarding this...

213
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,830
- tragedy.
- You bet your ass we are.

214
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,917
The victim was the mother of one of
your compadres who we know you killed.

215
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,420
But can't prove, right, Officer?

216
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,840
It's Detective. And can't prove yet.

217
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,009
Show them the disc.

218
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,480
Time stamp is yesterday afternoon,
same time as...

219
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,025
- Eva Arenas' TOD.
- That's bullshit.

220
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,069
- Anyone could reset a time stamp.
- Check it out.

221
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,738
Yesterday's paper.

222
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,285
That arrogant prick. He knew
we'd peg him for Arenas' murder,

223
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,912
so he covered his ass,
had someone else do the deed.

224
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,082
- That makes him an accomplice, right?
- Not without evidence.

225
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,169
Cut him loose.

226
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,848
Red rover, red rover,
send Chino back over.

227
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,030
Yo, Dex, check this out.

228
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,039
13 and counting.

229
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:07,168
They're so swamped up there
they had to bring in outside talent,

230
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,462
which would be moi.

231
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,260
Bet this guy never expected his work
to see the light of day.

232
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,137
Bet you're right.

233
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,641
It can't be easy
to hide a body nowadays.

234
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,102
- You shitting me?
- Hypothetical.

235
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:28,189
You're the Bay Harbor Butcher. How do you
make sure a disposed body stays disposed?

236
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:32,193
Tons of options. Everglades,
alligators, pig farms,

237
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,821
sulphuric acid, wood chipper, incinerator.

238
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,073
Hell, even meat pies.

239
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,826
- The mind boggles.
- Don't all those run the risk of contact

240
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,204
- with the outside world?
- You got a better idea?

241
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,916
No.

242
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:51,337
And that's the problem. Where
do I put Chino when I'm done with him?

243
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,509
Captain's coming up with that FBI guy.
He's got a fuckin' entourage.

244
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:21,367
All right, listen up, everyone. Briefing room in
two minutes for Show and Tell.

245
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,621
All right.

246
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:31,085
The Bay Harbor Butcher case
is now a Miami Metro case.

247
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:35,089
And it is shaping up to be
the biggest one in our history.

248
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,091
We're now at 14 confirmed.

249
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,635
The FBI has sent over their top man,

250
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,180
Special Agent Frank Lundy,
to help solve this crime.

251
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,056
Now...

252
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,643
this will not be
a jurisdictional circle jerk.

253
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,271
This will be a shining example

254
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:54,901
of two agencies working together
for the public good.

255
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,611
Agent Lundy.

256
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:03,201
Hello, everyone. There is no such thing
as the perfect crime,

257
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,037
not in my experience, anyway.

258
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,665
With your help and with the mistakes
this person has made

259
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,836
and will eventually make,
we'll find whoever did this awful thing.

260
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:18,549
I need everyone in every department
up to speed on what we are doing,

261
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:23,137
while I review your files
and put our task force together.

262
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,515
So, let's get a jump-start
on the Bay Harbor Butcher,

263
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,602
a moniker which, by the way, repulses me.

264
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,437
Well, we have something in common.

265
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,606
Can someone get the lights?

266
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,490
The first report from the field
had these parts as coming from one body.

267
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,741
Actually, it's two.

268
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,743
Actually, it's two.

269
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,287
There's been speculation
that this human harvest

270
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,415
might be connected to a case
you've recently solved.

271
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:55,503
But there are several inconsistencies between
the two sets of body parts,

272
00:20:55,629 --> 00:21:00,591
gender, exsanguination,
specific methods of dissection.

273
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,010
Not to mention my guys deserved it.

274
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:07,139
The evidence just isn't there to piggyback this
onto the Ice-Truck Killer.

275
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,603
We're looking for a different suspect.
All information is to be disseminated...

276
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,522
Miss me, brother?

277
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,276
...all agency protocol...

278
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,779
Putting it plainly...

279
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:27,118
I can't afford to lose it like this, not with
Special Agent Rock Star on my case.

280
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,203
Do not discuss this case.

281
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,622
I need to clear the decks.

282
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,457
And my head.

283
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,051
I'm coming for you tonight, Little Chino.

284
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,262
And this time there won't be any screw-ups.

285
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:51,392
Just slam in your CO2 cartridge here,
put in your tranq dart and let her rip.

286
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,103
Wham, bam, lights fuckin' out.

287
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,232
So, 'gators giving you trouble, Dex?

288
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,776
They ate my puppy.

289
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:07,575
This sucker, you load her up right,
she'll take down a goddamn grizzly.

290
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,369
Now, you may have to get closer
than you'd like,

291
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,706
but she'll do the job, I promise you that.

292
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,875
So which will it be?

293
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,170
Both.

294
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,630
Excellent.

295
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,673
Oh, fuck!

296
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,050
Oh, fuck.

297
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,763
First time?

298
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,598
Sort of.

299
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,850
Yeah, I've been boxing since I was ten.

300
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,938
- Tough neighborhood?
- Tough family.

301
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,941
And those are just my sisters.

302
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,070
Want some help?

303
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,865
- I'm doing enough damage on my own.
- Is that a yes or a no?

304
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,453
That was a yes. It sounded like a no,

305
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,122
but...

306
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,289
Yeah. Yeah.

307
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,292
Good answer.

308
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,216
First...

309
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:53,180
you need to wrap your wrists
so you don't hurt yourself again.

310
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,148
I'm...

311
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,151
I'm sorry.

312
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,501
Yo, Deb!

313
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,260
You scared the shit out of me.

314
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,222
How are you doing?

315
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,433
How am I doing?

316
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,685
I saw the man I thought I loved...

317
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,229
No, did love,

318
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:45,274
up on some goddamn screen
with a gallery full of women

319
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,067
that he murdered and cut into pieces.

320
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,195
- Deb, I...
- Don't.

321
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,405
You fuckin' asked.

322
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,909
So, how am I doing?

323
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,703
I'm just fine.

324
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,099
I might be playing fast and loose
with my father's code,

325
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,894
but I don't think Harry would disapprove...

326
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,438
considering.

327
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,858
Attaboy, Chino, a little closer.

328
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,244
Come on, don't get the shakes now,
this is no time for performance anxiety.

329
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,973
I've been waiting for you.

330
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,644
Take him! Tommy!

331
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,188
I'll get his ass!

332
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,826
No, no, no! I don't know
where the fuck he is!

333
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:38,053
We're out here all night long if we have to.
You find him, OK?

334
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:44,226
What the hell is wrong with me?

335
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,819
Dexter, someone's coming.

336
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,710
It's OK, I got you.

337
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,545
Please don't hurt us!

338
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,173
God. Oh, my God.

339
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,850
No! Dexter, don't leave me!

340
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,979
Biney!

341
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,566
Don't leave me!

342
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,319
Dexter, please don't leave me!

343
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,738
Biney!

344
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,367
Biney! Biney!

345
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,580
Brian, my brother.

346
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,755
Somebody must have seen something.

347
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,049
Seeing and talking are two different things.

348
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,010
- You want me to knock on some doors?
- Or maybe some heads.

349
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,762
Sorry I'm late.

350
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,473
What fucking asshole left this here?

351
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:08,227
It's Special Agent Fucking Asshole.

352
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,690
- Morgan, right?
- We got witnesses to interview.

353
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,609
You seen my brother?

354
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,277
Oh. Excuse me.

355
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,545
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a minute?

356
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,131
Or three. Good tea takes time.

357
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:41,635
- What's up, Sergeant?
- It's about your task force.

358
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,679
I think I can bring something to it, sir.

359
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,932
I've looked into your jacket, Sergeant.

360
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,143
You've done some fine work
here in Homicide.

361
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,645
- Miami Metro's lucky to have you.
- Thank you, sir.

362
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,148
But I don't think
you'd be a good fit for my team.

363
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,986
- I thought you just said I was qualified.
- I said you'd done fine work in Homicide.

364
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,948
Frankly, Sergeant, you're more
of a leader than a team member.

365
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,076
I'm not convinced you play well with others.

366
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,330
Excuse me.

367
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,297
Can somebody clean this shit up?

368
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,802
I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece

369
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,805
and I'm not even sure
what the picture should be.

370
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,269
I've been calling you for hours.

371
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,732
Kind of pulled an all-nighter.

372
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,193
Dexter, I called the station.

373
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,069
I was off the clock.

374
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,863
It's this huge case I'm working.

375
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,823
It's...

376
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,868
It's taking me to places
I never thought I'd go.

377
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,956
What?

378
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,463
I've been thinking a lot about Paul's death and
how I'm gonna deal with it.

379
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,549
- And?
- First of all,

380
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,968
I'm not gonna let the county bury him.

381
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:08,597
I'm using the insurance money
to give Paul a proper funeral. It's in an hour.

382
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,849
Rita, Paul was such a...

383
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,770
...destructive force,
why can't you just put him behind you?

384
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,438
It's about saying goodbye.

385
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:20,776
Goodbye to him and the grip
he had on my life. It's called moving on.

386
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,573
Go clean yourself up.
The kids are expecting you.

387
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,742
- I'm just gonna make you late.
- Damn it, Dexter!

388
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:32,079
I need you there too.
You have no idea what this feels like.

389
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,258
Just give me ten minutes.

390
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,681
Can't wait to get another door
slammed in my face.

391
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:54,476
Yeah. If I lived in this neighborhood,
I wouldn't talk to the cops either.

392
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,270
Brave guy like you?

393
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,731
It's about survival.
These people have families, kids.

394
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,527
It's not easy to talk when you got the 29th
Street Kings playing whack the witness.

395
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,530
- It just takes one, right?
- That's it.

396
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:10,450
Put that out into the universe. Right?

397
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,832
- Miami Metro. Can we talk to you?
- Go to hell!

398
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:21,086
OK, but before we do that, ma'am,
can I ask you a few questions?

399
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:25,507
- How many is a few?
- Three. But one's a two-parter.

400
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:29,761
- Go away before I call the police!
- We are the fucking police!

401
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,391
I ain't talking to no one!

402
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,768
- Look at the bright side.
- What bright side?

403
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,521
Karmically, we're batting 1,000.

404
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:43,317
There's something balancing
about that kind of consistency.

405
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,737
God damn it!

406
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,447
Morgan!

407
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,042
Aw, shit.

408
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:21,271
You think you can spray-paint your gang crap
on a police car and get away with it?

409
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:24,358
Get off! Unless you want to fuck me
like you fucked the Ice-Truck Killer!

410
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,485
You gangbanging-wannabe piece of shit!

411
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,654
No, please.

412
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,239
I'll tell you where the shit is,
the drugs and shit.

413
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,617
- Please don't shoot me, miss.
- Morgan!

414
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,596
If I believed in God,

415
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,974
if I believed in sin,

416
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,435
this is the place where
I'd be sucked straight to hell...

417
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:05,023
if I believed in hell.

418
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,073
Come on, Dexter. It's all right.

419
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,549
But that is not the entire story
of who this man was.

420
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:35,387
Born into innocence
as are all of God's children...

421
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:39,266
...are truly the living personification
of God's...

422
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:43,061
...through the magic of family,
giving love and receiving love,

423
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,980
that he truly flourished.

424
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:49,067
It was with his children
that he, for all his blemishes,

425
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,778
re-embraced the perfect innocence.

426
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:57,451
And it was through his children that once again
God smiled on Paul Bennett.

427
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,873
And now the family will come forward
for a few moments of silent prayer.

428
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,686
I hope you found your peace, Paul.

429
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,452
Bye, Dad.

430
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,518
I'm so sorry for your loss.

431
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,187
Thank you...

432
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,480
Father.

433
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,943
I'm not sorry.

434
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,196
You're still here.

435
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,697
Never left.

436
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,991
Yeah, you did. I killed you.

437
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,619
No. You just took my life.

438
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,377
So how do I make you go away?

439
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:36,967
Well, you could try doing
what these people are doing.

440
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,345
I'm not like them.

441
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:51,273
Well, if it helps,
I can tell you it's not your fault,

442
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,275
what you did to me.

443
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,943
I never said it was.

444
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,278
But you feel it.

445
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,948
How do you know that?

446
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,616
It's human nature.

447
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,911
I'm not human.

448
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,204
No.

449
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,666
You're just fucked up.

450
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,722
I need to let you go.

451
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,394
You think it's as simple as that?

452
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,235
Nothing's simple.

453
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,240
Does this mean you'll be my dad now?

454
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,100
- 29th Street Kings?
- Yeah, we got 'em.

455
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,229
SWAT did a sweep on some auto shop those
animals were using as a front.

456
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,105
Maybe we didn't get them on murder,

457
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,734
but we busted their asses on drugs, weapons
and money laundering.

458
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,196
Half of them are three-strikers,
so they're gonna go away forever.

459
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,406
Thanks to Officer Morgan.

460
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,170
Hey, something you should know.

461
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,757
Deb pulled her gun on an unarmed boy
to get him to give up the gang,

462
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,009
some kid named Joey Nunez.

463
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,512
- Thanks, Angel, I'll talk to her.
- All right.

464
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:49,224
I'll give her one thing, though,
she's in motherfucking good shape.

465
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,809
Here comes another one.

466
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,187
Did we get Little Chino too?

467
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,439
That cocksucker wasn't there.

468
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,776
That's too bad.

469
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,781
- What you got?
- None of your business.

470
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,083
Yeah.

471
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,044
Excuse me, Esmee,
I opened this by mistake.

472
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,713
It said Lieutenant.

473
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,381
No worries.

474
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,092
Today, Maria, it is all about the win.

475
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,303
I think we really should enjoy this.

476
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,724
Stop me if you think I'm speaking out of turn or
above my station,

477
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:35,603
but we really don't use department resources
around here for personal matters.

478
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,690
- What are you talking about?
- Well, let's, for argument's sake,

479
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,401
say those phone records
belong to your fianc?.

480
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,864
It could open up a shit-ugly can of worms you
might not be able to close.

481
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,034
Only if someone mentions it.

482
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,955
This is me not mentioning it.

483
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,836
Maria.

484
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,714
I'm new at this,

485
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,634
this...not trusting the man
that I thought that I loved...

486
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,094
and...

487
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,931
I really appreciate your support.

488
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,073
Hey, Deb, it's me.

489
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,115
Again.

490
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,117
You're probably at the gym.

491
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,285
Again.

492
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,996
I got some unfinished business
outside the office.

493
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:39,542
I'll probably be a little late tonight.
I'll catch up with you later.

494
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,922
It was simple, really.

495
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:52,425
All I had to do was put myself
into the mind of a killer,

496
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,511
hardly a stretch.

497
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:58,014
It was only a matter of time
before Little Chino went after Joey Nunez

498
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,724
for snitching him out.

499
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,193
Here's hoping I'm back on my game.

500
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,515
Trust me, you're not
going anywhere this time.

501
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,475
Who the fuck are you?

502
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,810
Now...

503
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:48,106
that kind of talk is just gonna bring you closer
to your victims.

504
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,571
Are you a cop?

505
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,781
'Cause I was cleared on that bitch.

506
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:02,245
No, maybe you didn't do the deed,
but her blood is on your hands.

507
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,916
A lot of blood is on your hands.

508
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,964
What do you care about these people?

509
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,510
Actually...

510
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,721
Agh! Fuck. Fu...

511
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,056
...I don't.

512
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,476
Why are you doing this to me?

513
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:32,817
I'm not so much doing this to you
as I'm doing it for me.

514
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,878
I never killed no kid.

515
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,505
But you killed most of her.

516
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,008
Her mother.

517
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,261
Her brother.

518
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,182
Her innocence.

519
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,354
You leave pain wherever you go.

520
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,902
You kill me...

521
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,238
what do you leave behind?

522
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,823
A world without you.

523
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,993
Look at that. Steady as a surgeon.

524
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:58,653
This kill was just the first of the loose ends
I needed to tie off.

525
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,989
I also found a newer,
safer place to dump my trash.

526
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,867
Moving at over four miles an hour,

527
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:08,621
the Gulf Stream is one of the world's
most powerful deepwater currents.

528
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:11,666
This time tomorrow,
Little Chino will be north of Palm Beach.

529
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,294
After that, it's on to Georgia, South Carolina,

530
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,964
North Carolina, until eventually...

531
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:22,844
Well, let's just say,
the North Atlantic's a pretty big place.

532
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,360
Hey, you.

533
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,530
- I need to see you.
- I was just dropping somebody off.

534
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,866
- Can it wait?
- No, it can't.

535
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,077
All right, then.

536
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,885
A shoe?

537
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,014
You wanted to see me about a shoe?

538
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,018
It's Paul's shoe.

539
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,025
OK.

540
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,071
What do we do with it?

541
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:29,452
Paul kept insisting to me

542
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,580
that you knocked him over the head,

543
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:36,083
dragged him to his motel
and shot him up with drugs.

544
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:42,256
Sounds like one of his stories, huh?

545
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,719
He asked me to look in the yard
for his shoe.

546
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,888
Finally, I did.

547
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,059
- Maybe...
- No, let me finish, Dexter.

548
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:01,234
I didn't have a lot to hope for until I met you.

549
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,113
You gave me something to believe in

550
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,866
when I didn't even believe in myself.

551
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,286
And maybe I was...

552
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,581
maybe I was so desperate
that I looked the other way.

553
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:20,419
Paul begged me to help him.

554
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,172
And what did I do?

555
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:25,299
I hung up on him.

556
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,094
And he was so upset,
he got into a prison fight,

557
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,304
and he was beaten to death with a pipe.

558
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,640
That's not your fault.

559
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,433
Part of it is.

560
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:39,897
Part of me believes that,
with all of Paul's flaws...

561
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,192
he paid the price for my dreams.

562
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,539
Did you attack him, Dexter?

563
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,419
I'd understand if you did.
He attacked me.

564
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,806
I hit Paul to protect you and the kids.

565
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,769
It was totally an act of impulse.

566
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:21,814
OK.

567
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,318
OK.

568
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,658
Where did you get the drugs?

569
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:39,206
Stolen from the evidence locker.

570
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:46,964
Wait.

571
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,342
Wait.

572
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,718
Wait, you mean...

573
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,888
First you tell me that you...

574
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,599
acted on impulse,

575
00:48:56,725 --> 00:49:00,895
and then you tell me that you stole the drugs
from your police station?

576
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:06,400
I mean, what are you trying to say?
That you planned on acting on impulse?

577
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:10,613
- It's all kind of jumbled now.
- How did you know how to cook the heroin?

578
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:14,408
How did you know what dose
to give a big guy like Paul?

579
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,252
Oh, my God.

580
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,463
Oh, my God, why didn't I see this?

581
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,925
They were your drugs.

582
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,969
Now it makes sense.

583
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:37,682
That's where you disappear to at all hours
of the night like Clark fucking Kent.

584
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,353
Look, if there is anything left between us,

585
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:46,399
you will answer me this one question
and you will tell me the truth.

586
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:51,404
Are you an addict?

587
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,085
Yes, I have an addiction.

588
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,098
Oh, Dexter.

589
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:23,644
That's good.

590
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:27,231
That's the first step,
admitting you have a problem.

591
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,859
We'll get you into a program.

592
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,486
We'll get you the help you need.

593
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:34,572
And I will be there for you.

594
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,586
If the eyes are the windows to the soul,

595
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,464
then grief is the door.

596
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:58,179
As long as it's closed, it's the barrier between
knowing and not knowing.

597
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,349
Walk away from it
and it stays closed forever.

598
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,728
But open it and walk through it...

599
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,774
and pain becomes truth.

600
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:18,365
And now I'm faced with the struggle
for my own survival

601
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,534
that I always knew was coming.

602
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,795
I've been preparing for this my entire life.

603
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,633
When all is said and done, Chino,

604
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,885
you're the same size as everyone else.

605
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,643
Hey, Dex, what the fuck?

606
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,813
Hold on, I'm coming!

607
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,988
It's annoying, isn't it?

608
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,282
I'm not taking the bait.

609
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,247
- You're up late.
- Yeah, just surfing.

610
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,124
You go to the gym?

611
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:12,378
Then I was sort of driving around.

612
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,713
Around what?

613
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,924
Around town.

614
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:20,010
- Because?
- I saw some buildings

615
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,972
with some "For rent" signs.
I'm gonna check 'em out.

616
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,269
Then Chez Dexter can return to its original,

617
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:32,064
semi-lived-in, museum-quality state.

618
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:36,026
- Deb, you don't need to do this.
- Yes, I do.

619
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,653
You don't need to do this now.

620
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:40,614
Well, what about the video tours
of eligible apartments?

621
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,867
Temporary insanity.

622
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,288
You sure?

623
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,084
No. Get out.

624
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,588
Asshole.

625
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:59,425
This way I can take care of my sister
the way Harry would have wanted.

626
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,344
You really reek.

627
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,392
You're right. Like a fuckin' sewer.

628
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,482
For every door that closes...

629
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:16,942
Fuck.

630
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,653
Sorry.

631
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,161
It was always right there.

632
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:33,000
I had to say goodbye in order to reconnect

633
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:35,961
with what's really important...

634
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,714
with who I was...

635
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,677
with who I have to be.

636
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,185
Rest in peace.
