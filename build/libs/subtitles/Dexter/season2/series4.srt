www.YYeTs.com

3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,460
Previously on "dexter"...

4
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,200
two treasure hunters made
a ghastly discovery today

5
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,300
When they stumbled
on what appears to be

6
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,530
An underwater graveyard

7
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,460
In a crevice
off the coast of miami.

8
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,060
Agent lundy has requested
the following officers

9
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,630
For his joint task force.

10
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,230
We're a team, and our first play
is i.D.Ing those bodies.

11
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,830
I'm dexter morgan.

12
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,130
I know who you are.

13
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,730
Hoping they'll talk to you?

14
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,230
They always speak.

15
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,760
You just got to ask
the right question.

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,460
Harry was right.

17
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,230
Nothing stays buried,
perhaps not even me.

18
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,960
Should i be worried
about pascal?

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,730
And you're asking me
because?

20
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,430
Because you've done
the job.

21
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,560
So, if she's out,
that means you're back in.

22
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,130
I won't dignify rumors, captain.
Pascal's fine.

23
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,800
You need to, uh,
wrap your wrists

24
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,530
So you don't hurt
yourself again.

25
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,230
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,260
We'll get you
into a program,

27
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,700
We'll get you the help
you need,

28
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,660
And i will be there
for you.

29
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,460
I'm dexter,
and i'm not sure what i am.

30
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,030
Everyone in that room has heard
or lived far worse

31
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,560
Than anything
you've ever done.

32
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,130
I doubt it.

33
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,930
How full of shit are you?

34
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,660
The mask is slipping.

35
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,700
People who never mattered before
are suddenly starting to matter.

36
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,330
Didn't your tour
in the army

37
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,900
Include some special op
in haiti?

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,160
There's my sponsor.
Really, where?

39
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,000
Just as the worst heat wave
in years hits miami,

40
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,230
The heat is also on me.

41
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,530
It's week three

42
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,860
Of the bay harbor butcher
investigation,

43
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,600
And superduper
special agent lundy

44
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,860
Has yet to throw up
his hands and say,

45
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,300
"Wow, this guy's good.
I give up."

46
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,100
Dexter, please.

47
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,230
Do you want me to help?

48
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,930
No, i just -
I just need you to move.

49
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,600
Ah.

50
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,500
I'm sorry. It's just, you know,
my mother's coming today.

51
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,800
I certainly do.

52
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,800
I haven't seen her
in so long,

53
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,200
And i just want everything
to be nice.

54
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,200
We kind of ended things
on bad terms.

55
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,060
She and paul didn't get along
so well.

56
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,160
A lot of people and paul
didn't get along so well.

57
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,500
Yeah.

58
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,530
But i - I think she's willing
to put that behind us.

59
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,200
She heard
about paul's passing,

60
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,260
And she wanted to come
and be supportive.

61
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,060
That sounds promising,
right?

62
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,300
Absolutely.

63
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,560
You'll like her, dexter.
She's great.

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,630
She's a very strong woman.

65
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll keep that in mind

66
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,400
In case i have any
heavy lifting to do.

67
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,930
It's too hot.

68
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,830
I know, honey.
Hopefully it'll cool down soon.

69
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,700
Did you sleep any better
last night?

70
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,060
More nightmares?

71
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,500
What was it, the big,
scary ghost or the alligator?

72
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,960
No, the bay harbor butcher.

73
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,460
Oh, honey.

74
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,330
He would never hurt you.

75
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,260
But i'll let you in
on a secret.

76
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,100
My sister, debra,

77
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,260
Who is a secret police agent
ninja warrior,

78
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,100
Said he only kills
bad people,

79
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,260
And you're not a bad person,
are you?

80
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,530
No.

81
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,030
Then you're quite safe.

82
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,800
Why don't you go get dressed,

83
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,460
And i will make you
some breakfast, okay?

84
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,700
It makes me so angry

85
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,160
That there's some monster
out there scaring my son.

86
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,260
I got to go to work.

87
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,360
You know,
i hope they catch him today.

88
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,200
And i'm not a violent person,
but i hope they hurt him.

89
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,500
Have a good day.

90
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,760
Make up your mind.

91
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,400
In our most paranoid moments,

92
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,160
We fear that everyone
is talking about us.

93
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,760
That's become my reality.

94
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,030
I can't hear what they're
saying, but i know it's not nice.

95
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,000
All right,
let's get started.

96
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,500
We have positive i.D.S on all 18
of our complete bodies.

97
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,530
13 of those have felony records.

98
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,260
Organized crime.

99
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,800
Nope. No connection
to organized crime,

100
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,160
No mutual gang
affiliation, either.

101
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,830
But all 13 were either tried
for murder, or at least suspected of murder.

102
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,330
Still,
you have your pattern.

103
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,160
Yes, we just don't know
what it means.

104
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,460
I think we go out
with this news immediately.

105
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,430
What news is that?

106
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,230
The news that our serial killer, is
only killing the dregs of society,

107
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,460
That good, moral people
have nothing to fear.

108
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,700
But, captain, that's all -
Uh...

109
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,760
this is the only lead
we have.

110
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,930
We need to keep it
tightly wrapped.

111
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,200
Last night, an elderly man shot
his son, when he came home late,

112
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,260
Thought it was
the bay harbor butcher.

113
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,730
We've got a city
in chaos here, frank.

114
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,260
I understand you wanting
to reassure the people.

115
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,800
Good.
Then we're in agreement.

116
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,060
Dex, i got this huge break
in the bay harbor case.

117
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,360
Bullshit.

118
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,400
I mean, really?

119
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,630
Guys, guys. You are not going to...

120
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,530
i refuse to believe
that vince masuka is the man

121
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Who single-Handedly
brings me down.

122
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,700
I also know denial is the first
stage of the grieving process

123
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,730
For those who learn
they're going to die.

124
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,800
I need to find out
what masuka knows,

125
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:27,630
But i've got to be calm
and centered... and focused.

126
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,800
Time for a visit to my sponsor.

127
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,030
I need help.

128
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,700
Hi!

129
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,260
Hey! Just a minute!

130
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,500
Dexter.

131
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,160
Hope i'm not interrupting anything.

132
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,100
No.
Glad you called.

133
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,360
Just give me a minute.

134
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,860
Yeah, have a look around.

135
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,860
So, hey, i was gonna go and get
some art supplies.

136
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,760
Is that all right?
Do you want to come?

137
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,100
Yeah, i'm just
on my lunch break.

138
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,160
Excellent.

139
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,260
Why are they eating
each other?

140
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,330
Don't know. Ask them.

141
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,060
* it's a long way home

142
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,930
* and it's all i see
is darkness *

143
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,960
* it's a long way home

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,360
Do you like the heat?

145
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,230
Um... not really.
I'm partial to air-Conditioning.

146
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,900
I love it.

147
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,860
It makes me feel like
the whole world could explode at any moment.

148
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,800
That's a pleasant thought.

149
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,330
Is there an art store
near here?

150
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,900
So, you been using?

151
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,500
Using what? Oh.

152
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,230
Uh, no.

153
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,900
No drugs.
Perfectly clean.

154
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,130
Look what we have here!

155
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,730
Jesus.
What are you -

156
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,430
Come on.

157
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,230
Are you gonna help or what?

158
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,230
That was a little weird.

159
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,030
So, if you're perfectly clean,
why'd you call?

160
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,760
I- I'm under a lot of pressure
at work.

161
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,900
I was hoping you could maybe
give me some quick tips

162
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,900
On how to deal
with the urges.

163
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,600
There are no quick tips.

164
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,260
Oh. I see.

165
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,130
Someone's gonna hear that.
They'll think it's the wind.

166
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,430
I thought we were going
to get art supplies.

167
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,860
That's exactly
what we're doing.

168
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,060
I work with found art.

169
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,430
It's more like stolen art.

170
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,430
Is this what a sponsor normally
does on their first meeting?

171
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,830
I don't know.

172
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,960
I've never sponsored
anyone before.

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,960
Really?

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,160
Yeah, but don't worry.

175
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,400
I've had all kinds
of sponsors.

176
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,360
Learnt from the best.

177
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,960
You do realize i work
with the police department?

178
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,560
If we get caught,
you can flash your badge.

179
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,460
I don't have a badge.
I have a laminate.

180
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,330
Could we talk
about why i called you?

181
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,500
Yeah, sure.

182
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,000
Um
you want help.

183
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,930
So, tell me.

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,630
Why do you use?

185
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,700
Why?

186
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,160
I don't know.
It's just part of who i am.

187
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,860
And who are you?

188
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,400
I'm a...

189
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,060
...bad person.

190
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,330
You haven't got the first idea
who you are, have you?

191
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,760
Dexter, meet dexter.

192
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,730
I'm gonna help the two of you
get to know each other.

193
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,860
That doesn't really seem
necessary.

194
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,830
The first step to recovery
is accepting who you are.

195
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,130
I thought the first step was
admitting you have a problem.

196
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,100
And before you can accept
who you are,

197
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,600
You have to know
who you are.

198
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,960
So that's our first job.

199
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,860
You're going to tell me all
your deepest, darkest secrets.

200
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,100
There is something off
about him, harry.

201
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,760
You know why.

202
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,860
All right, look.

203
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,030
It wouldn't hurt to have him
tested, would it?

204
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,900
Hello? Yes.

205
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,660
It - Just a sec.

206
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,460
I got to get back.
Dead body.

207
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,200
Hmm. How many times have you
used that one before?

208
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:43,330
So, the husband's name
is barnes, b-A-R-N-E-S.

209
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,230
What do we have?

210
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,760
Hello, dexter.

211
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,160
Uh, gunshot victim,
alisha barnes, 36.

212
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,760
So, i heard there may be
some big break

213
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,160
In the bay harbor
butcher case.

214
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,860
Uh, could be.

215
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,330
The neighbor heard the victim arguing
with her husband last night, curtis barnes.

216
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,760
Masuka was pretty excited
about it.

217
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,530
Husband's car is gone.

218
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,530
Nobody knows where he is.
Any idea what they found?

219
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,360
Can we concentrate
on this case here, please?

220
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,630
Sure.

221
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,530
The killer was standing
right about where you are, sergeant doakes.

222
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,830
Two shots to the chest.

223
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,460
I only see one hole
in the chest.

224
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,160
Yeah, they are
that close together.

225
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,600
It's very impressive shooting.

226
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:33,300
It looks like the bullets took nearly
identical exit paths, judging from the spray.

227
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,600
And this was all topped off
by a final shot to the head.

228
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,960
She was mozambiqued.

229
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,230
What?

230
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,830
Triple-Tapped.

231
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,360
Oh, shit.

232
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,800
I'm guessing
this is curtis barnes.

233
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,460
Here he is in what looks like somalia,
afghanistan, a russian grenade, a kurdish dagger,

234
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,130
And tell me that shit wasn't
stolen from saddam's palace.

235
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,500
What are you saying?

236
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,400
I'm saying
asshole's special ops.

237
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,960
There's no doubt about it.

238
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,860
Huh, they're generally known for
settling their arguments so peaceably.

239
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,530
Don't get smug with me.

240
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,100
Sounds like we're
in your world, james.

241
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,830
Yeah, i'll take lead
on this one.

242
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,700
Pick a body.

243
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,730
Sir?

244
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,900
I want you each to pick a body.

245
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,330
This is where the case
is going to be made.

246
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:39,100
We have 13 suspected murderers,
and then we have these gentlemen.

247
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:44,860
Robert thatcher, janitor for the
school district with no criminal record.

248
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,560
Marcus white,

249
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,630
Tow-Truck driver,

250
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,300
No criminal record.

251
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,060
And this - This is...

252
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,460
oscar sota.

253
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,800
What's his story?

254
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,000
Naval engineer
for the port of miami,

255
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,430
Member of the stewardship council
of st. Tarsicia catholic church,

256
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,260
Married, loved, respected.

257
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,560
But he was found in a bag
under the sea with 13 killers.

258
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,000
Why?

259
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,430
Answer that question,
then we really know something.

260
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,100
I... i got him.

261
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,830
Oscar sota.

262
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,900
Why did the killer cut them up
like this?

263
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,300
Ease of disposal. Or for fun.

264
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,030
You don't kill this many people
because it's a chore.

265
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,860
You do it
'cause you like it.

266
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,000
Okay.

267
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,130
Great.

268
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,430
Tomorrow.
The barnes case?

269
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,830
Yeah, that was a buddy of mine
from special ops.

270
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,960
He heard curtis barnes
was still in miami.

271
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,360
Oh.

272
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,700
The only part of that that i find
surprising is that you have a buddy.

273
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,130
It turns out barnes and i
both were ranger rrd.

274
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,300
Regimental reconnaissance
detachment,

275
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07,130
The guys you're not supposed to know
about who get in before everybody else.

276
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,300
A brother in arms. Something like that.

277
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,130
My buddy put me in touch
with a guy from curtis' unit.

278
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,630
He's willing to talk to me.

279
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,830
Good.

280
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,000
I got your blood report.

281
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,960
It's all pretty
straightforward.

282
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,330
I'd be careful, though.

283
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
Why is that?

284
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,160
The trajectory of the bullets
are all level,

285
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,630
Exact same angle of origin.

286
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,760
I'd say all three shots were
fired in less than a second.

287
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,000
It's very impressive shooting.

288
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,160
Morgan.

289
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,560
I'm gonna need you to run
some tests on this shirt.

290
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,300
Is there blood?

291
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,330
No blood.

292
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,330
I'm really the blood guy.

293
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,030
It's a smell.
It smells like a woman.

294
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,700
Which part?

295
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,360
Who can identify this
for me?

296
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,330
Uh...

297
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,030
you know, that's really
masuka's area.

298
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,230
He's definitely your man.

299
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,000
Thanks.

300
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,260
Anything i can do to overburden
masuka is to my advantage.

301
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,000
Trust me, i'm not above
sending pizzas and hookers

302
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,330
To his house
in the middle of the night.

303
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,230
Well, everything's unpacked.

304
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,600
The back bedroom's small,
but it's quieter.

305
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,960
I'm just happy to be here,
that's all.

306
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,060
You're always welcome.

307
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,700
Am i?

308
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,930
I wasn't sure.

309
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,300
Of course you are.

310
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,930
All these years
without an invitation.

311
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,060
I just - I thought
you didn't want to come.

312
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,900
I mean, you and paul -
Oh, nonsense.

313
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,260
I wasn't gonna let that keep me away
from my daughter and my grandchildren.

314
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,060
But you did let it
keep you away.

315
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,330
Let's not assign
blame, rita.

316
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,800
Nothing good ever
comes of that.

317
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,660
We'll just have to make up
for lost time, that's all.

318
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,730
Hi.
Hey.

319
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,030
Dexter,
this is my mother.

320
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,860
Gail.
So nice to meet you.

321
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,530
Nice to meet you, too,
dexter.

322
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:36,930
I've always been good
with parents.

323
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,630
The key is to simply think
of them as aliens

324
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,130
From a distant universe.

325
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,600
"You have fibers and threads
unknown to us.

326
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,500
Your ancient customs
intrigue me."

327
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,360
So, dexter, tell me everything
there is to know about you.

328
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,760
"You have made me your
sworn enemy, evil woman."

329
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,800
I work in the forensics department
for the miami metro p.D.,

330
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,030
And i'm very fond
of your daughter.

331
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,830
Good answer. I'm also very fond
of my daughter.

332
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,760
You did a good job
raising her.

333
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,360
30 years as a schoolteacher.

334
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,330
I've got a little experience with children,
and i see a young man who is not eating.

335
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,930
I'm not hungry.

336
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,000
He's scared the butcher's
gonna get him.

337
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,460
Oh, well, remember,
he only gets bad people.

338
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,260
I was bad today.
I threw a ball at tommy alvarez.

339
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,500
Well, that's not too bad,
and even if it was,

340
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,060
The bay harbor butcher
doesn't hurt kids.

341
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,630
He doesn't?

342
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,300
Definitely not.
You're safe.

343
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,700
When are they gonna hurry up
and catch this guy?

344
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,360
They are working as hard
as they can.

345
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,960
If what i've heard is true - That
he only goes after criminals -

346
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,700
I say leave him alone.

347
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,960
He's got my seal of approval.

348
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,030
Perhaps i have misjudged you,
o wise one.

349
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,300
Really?

350
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,230
Yeah, sister
spilled everything.

351
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,430
Thinks he killed their parents and
made it look like a car accident.

352
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,000
The living trust
was in his name.

353
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,930
Nice work.

354
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,730
So, what's it gonna be
tonight?

355
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,000
Chinese, italian?

356
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,760
Uh, actually, i have
a, uh, social appointment.

357
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,530
You mean like a date?

358
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,260
I guess you could
call it that.

359
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,460
Wow, look at you.

360
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,600
New in town
and already hooking up.

361
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,560
It's an introduction
arranged by a friend.

362
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
One needs to get out and have
a little fun on occasion.

363
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,560
It's something i strongly
recommend for you as well.

364
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,360
Yeah.
With the hours we work...

365
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,360
i'm serious.
Make time for it.

366
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,600
It'll help keep you
better balanced.

367
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,060
Yes, sir.

368
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,460
Are you okay?

369
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,360
Yeah, it's just...

370
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,760
...something at work.

371
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,460
Are you handling it okay?

372
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,730
I ended up seeing my sponsor
today at lunch.

373
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,400
How'd that go?

374
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,060
Not so great.

375
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,760
She's a little odd.

376
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,160
Plays a little loose
with the 12 steps.

377
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,700
That doesn't seem smart -
Making up your own.

378
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,330
Maybe it's 'cause it's
her first time being a sponsor.

379
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,560
Oh.

380
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,760
Well, maybe you should try
someone else.

381
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,700
I just want to do what's best
for my recovery.

382
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:13,200
Well, maybe someone older,
more like you, more manly.

383
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,160
Yeah, maybe.

384
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,530
Yeah.

385
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,230
Hey.

386
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,400
You remember me?

387
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah.

388
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,030
You're the girl
who doesn't like tape.

389
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,730
Debra, actually.

390
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,530
I'm gabriel.

391
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,060
Done for the night?

392
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,800
Yeah.

393
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,800
Any interest
in grabbing a drink?

394
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,630
Usually a lady has to buy me
dinner first.

395
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,430
Stop talking
and get your pants off.

396
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,300
Are you always like this?
No.

397
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,230
No, i haven't even had sex
since...

398
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,560
since what?

399
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,860
You all right?

400
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,160
Yeah, just one second.

401
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,760
Look, we don't have to do this,
you know?

402
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,300
Oh.

403
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,730
Oh, you're into
the kinky stuff, huh?

404
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,360
No, the last guy i had sex with
tried to kill me.

405
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,400
"Who is
the bay harbor butcher?"

406
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,700
God.

407
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,030
This obsession with him
is relentless,

408
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,660
Just like deb
and that damn treadmill.

409
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,660
Deb, do you ever stop?

410
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,130
Dexter, jesus, you're supposed
to be at rita's!

411
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,730
Sorry. Sorry.

412
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,530
Fuck.

413
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,660
Good morning.

414
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,000
So, that was a little weird
last night.

415
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:56,200
No, yeah.
Well, it was dark.

416
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,430
My eyes hadn't adjusted.
All i could see were shadows.

417
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,560
Yeah, well, please put those
shadows out of your mind.

418
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,100
So, what's this big break
in the bay harbor butcher case

419
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,530
I keep hearing about?

420
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,800
Algae.

421
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,030
Algae?

422
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,200
Yeah.

423
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,930
Masuka found
microscopic algae

424
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,160
Inside the garbage bags
with the bodies.

425
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,530
Algae under the sea -
Imagine that.

426
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,860
How does that help?

427
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,530
'Cause there are over 100,000
species, all different.

428
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,260
Masuka thinks he can use them
to pinpoint

429
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,400
In which harbor the killer
keeps his boat.

430
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,100
Oh.

431
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,460
He's got some marine biologists
coming down to take a look.

432
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,960
Can you imagine
something so little

433
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,600
Being the thing
that breaks this case?

434
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,060
I got to go.

435
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,930
I'll see you at the station.

436
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,760
It doesn't make sense.

437
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,630
If there's algae on my victims,

438
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,730
It would have to come from
the ocean where i dumped them.

439
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,830
Obviously,
i'm missing something,

440
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,700
And i don't like that.

441
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,300
Mrs. Sota, i understand

442
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,760
You wanting to protect
your husband's reputation,

443
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,030
But i also have to tell you
that your cooperation

444
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,760
Could help us catch
a serial killer.

445
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,930
I am cooperating.

446
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,730
You haven't told me anything.

447
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,860
'Cause there's nothing
to tell!

448
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,960
Maria.

449
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,300
You off to meet the man
from curtis' unit?

450
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,860
Yeah,
at the blue wing marina.

451
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,630
You have backup?

452
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,060
Oh, yeah,
all kinds of backup.

453
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,300
Helicopters and shit.

454
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,660
James.

455
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,930
Listen, we got a missing
murder suspect.

456
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,060
This guy's a friend of his.
I'm just gonna go talk to him.

457
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,660
Right.

458
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,930
You're the lone holdout.

459
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,430
Every other suspect
has a criminal past,

460
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,530
And not just
any criminal past.

461
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,660
They were all linked
to murder.

462
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,700
Oscar never murdered
anybody.

463
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,060
Then why was he killed?

464
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,230
I don't know. Maybe he found out
who the serial killer is!

465
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:57,460
Okay, so your husband
is an engineer and a secret crime fighter.

466
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,560
Por favor, olivia.

467
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Are you through?

468
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,330
You're gonna tell me
what he did.

469
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,500
Oh, no.
You are through.

470
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,960
Just what i needed.

471
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,930
Hello?

472
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,160
You doakes?

473
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,900
I am.

474
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,400
And i'm guessing you're not
gonna tell me your name.

475
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,630
I'm curtis barnes.

476
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,160
I checked you out.

477
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,000
We know a lot
of the same people.

478
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,000
Everyone says
i can trust you.

479
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,660
You can trust me.

480
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,930
I just need 48 hours.

481
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Now, i got somebody who's gonna
take me to cuba,

482
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,330
But it's gonna take a day
to get the papers i need.

483
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,530
So, what are you asking?

484
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,400
Stall the investigation.

485
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,160
Let me ask you
one question.

486
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Yeah.

487
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,830
Did you kill your wife?

488
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,830
Yeah. I killed alisha.

489
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,730
Turn around.

490
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,260
Turn the fuck around!

491
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,400
No, you are not
arresting me.

492
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,900
Put the fucking gun down
and turn around!

493
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:41,930
I don't think so.

494
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,830
So, how'd your social
appointment go last night?

495
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,630
Oh, you know...

496
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,960
i took your advice.

497
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,560
My advice?

498
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,060
To get out and have some fun.

499
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,900
Got laid big-Time.

500
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,430
Oh.

501
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,230
Well.

502
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,960
Oh -

503
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,660
Oh, i mean...

504
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,260
i don't usually just go to
the gym and pick up strangers.

505
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,400
The gym?

506
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,230
Really, you have
to save me here,

507
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,500
Or i'm gonna go outside
and shoot myself.

508
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:35,100
The way you're going,
you'd probably miss.

509
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,460
Thanks.

510
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,660
My date... was horrible.

511
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,200
I picked her up, and i don't
know miami, of course,

512
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,630
So i got us completely lost.

513
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,830
And she was chattering away the whole time
about this yogi master i just have to meet,

514
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,360
So by the time we got
to the restaurant,

515
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,360
I was tearing my hair out.

516
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,030
Oh, god. I'm sorry.

517
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,460
No, it was good.

518
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,200
It was a reminder that, uh,
i shouldn't be dating.

519
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,830
Of course you should be.

520
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,330
No.

521
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,230
It all comes down
to simple mathematics.

522
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:12,360
A really beautiful relationship
is a once-In-A-Lifetime thing,

523
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,700
And i've already had mine.

524
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,160
Lundy.

525
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,730
Hey, so, i heard you found some algae
that might help crack the big case.

526
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,930
You heard right.

527
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,330
What kind of algae?

528
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,700
Diatoms.

529
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,700
Eukaryotic algae.

530
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,430
Okay, this is the first time

531
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,660
I regret not being
a bigger nerd.

532
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,830
Eukaryotic?

533
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,300
I'll let manny explain it
to you.

534
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,930
He's picking up
the evidence tomorrow

535
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,460
So he can study it
in his own lab.

536
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,460
You know marine biologists -
Real prima donnas.

537
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,730
Any chance you could show me? Masuka.

538
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,200
Up front.

539
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,830
Oh, no.
It's that crazy witch.

540
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,960
What is this shit?

541
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,130
I told you to find a smell.

542
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,930
How fucking hard
can that be?

543
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,730
Uh, look, i told you,

544
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,130
A smell isn't it smells like another woman.
I can smell it!

545
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,530
Why can't you?!

546
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,460
This man is ruining
my life,

547
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,660
And you all go on like
nothing is happening!

548
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,030
Esmee.

549
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,500
Come on, come on.

550
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,860
This is the kind of thing

551
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,300
That makes me glad
i have no feelings.

552
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,630
Like they always say,

553
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,100
Never take your dirty laundry
to work.

554
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,960
We can stand here
all fucking day.

555
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,200
I don't give a fuck, but you're
gonna put that gun down.

556
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,000
Now, we were both rangers.
That bond goes deep.

557
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,130
That doesn't mean anything
to you?

558
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,300
If you weren't a ranger,
i'd have shot your ass by now.

559
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,300
You killed your wife, man.

560
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,760
I didn't mean to.

561
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,830
It happened, man.

562
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,800
You married?

563
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,400
No.

564
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,560
Ever?

565
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,030
Once.

566
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,830
She dropped your ass,
didn't she?

567
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,630
What -

568
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:48,200
Got tired of you punching holes
in the walls,

569
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,160
Waking up in the middle
of the night screaming?

570
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,030
Was she always yelling,
"you got to get help"?

571
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,960
So she sends you
to some doctor,

572
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,630
But you don't go,

573
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:07,700
'Cause you know there's no help
for this kind of fucked up.

574
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,430
And finally,
she can't take it anymore,

575
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:15,560
And she just says, "adi?S."

576
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,760
That sound about right?

577
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,130
You got it wrong, man.

578
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,360
I left her.

579
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,900
And why was that?

580
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:40,700
'Cause i was afraid if i didn't,
i'd kill her.

581
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,230
Let's take the boat out.

582
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,430
Now, why would we want
to do that, man?

583
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,530
We'd get out of this heat,
for one.

584
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,230
Nice ocean breeze.

585
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,960
Maybe head toward cuba.

586
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,660
No.

587
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,700
Come on, just get me
to within sight.

588
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,960
I could swim from there.

589
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,600
Once i'm there,
i could find the -

590
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,700
You're wasting your time.

591
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:14,000
Curtis, you're going back
to the station with me.

592
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:17,200
No.
I'm not going to prison.

593
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,130
I didn't mean to kill her.

594
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,060
It's the only way
out of here.

595
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,360
Can't get you
to reconsider?

596
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,760
Not a chance.

597
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,400
Well, that's too bad...

598
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:38,330
'cause like i said,
i'm not going to prison.

599
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,060
Put the fucking gun down,
curtis.

600
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,360
Don't make me do it,
curtis!

601
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,460
Motherfucker.

602
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,130
You gonna tell me
how you're doing?

603
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,100
I'm fine.

604
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,130
Come on, dex.
Open up.

605
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,630
Very fine?

606
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,860
You're gonna have to do better
than that.

607
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,760
What's going on inside
your head?

608
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,460
What are you thinking?

609
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,530
I'm afraid we're...

610
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,030
done...

611
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,900
you and i.

612
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,930
Serious?

613
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,700
You're breaking up with me?

614
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:47,460
Actually, i don't think i want
to answer any more questions.

615
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,600
Listen, dexter, whatever you
think is right is wrong.

616
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,800
He asks you a question,

617
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,930
I want you to think
of your answer first

618
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,530
And then tell him
the exact opposite, okay?

619
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,800
So, let's just jump in,
all right?

620
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:01,930
Does it make you angry

621
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,400
When your teachers tell you
what to do?

622
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,560
No.

623
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,930
Are you often bored?

624
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,660
No.

625
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,460
Have you ever killed
an animal?

626
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,030
No. Never.

627
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:29,630
I should get back to work.

628
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,330
Thanks...
for everything.

629
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,500
I heard about pascal's
little meltdown.

630
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,230
She's been under a lot
of stress.

631
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,030
You're still doing it.

632
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,230
What's that?

633
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,100
Sticking up for her.

634
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,630
She is my superior.

635
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,660
You know, i may have
misjudged you, maria.

636
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,360
Maybe you are more
than a political animal.

637
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,730
You just might be
a real cop.

638
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,160
That's what i've been trying
to tell you.

639
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,630
You're back in charge
of homicide,

640
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,330
Effective immediately.

641
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,960
Thank you.

642
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,700
Pascal just set women in
the department back 20 years.

643
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,100
It's up to you
to turn that around.

644
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,930
There it is,
like a gigantic white whale.

645
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,800
My moby dick.

646
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,830
Man, this heat.
I can't take it.

647
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,730
I've got to get in my car
before i fucking melt.

648
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,100
Which is exactly
what needs to happen

649
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,800
To my dearly departed friends.

650
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,430
Lila, what are you
doing here?

651
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,900
Hey. Dexter.

652
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:30,330
You know, i've been thinking
about you breaking up with me,

653
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:35,100
And, well, i don't think
it's in your best interest.

654
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,530
I'm tired...

655
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,060
and hot,
and i have somewhere to be.

656
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,260
I think you should give me
another chance.

657
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,930
There's nothing you can do
to help me.

658
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,700
It's not even you.
It's me.

659
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:53,300
I am who i am,
and nobody's gonna change that.

660
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,100
Whatever you think you are,

661
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,300
You don't have to be that.

662
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,360
That's where you're wrong.

663
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,330
Stop judging yourself.

664
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,760
There are no absolutes.

665
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,130
No one's all good or evil.

666
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:20,500
You're just gonna have
to trust me on this.

667
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,800
Jesus, dexter! What are you
so fucking scared of?

668
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,860
You make yourself
into a monster

669
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,030
So you no longer bear
responsibility for what you do.

670
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,860
"I can't help it.
I'm a monster.

671
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,460
Oh, of course i was gonna
do that - I'm a monster."

672
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,560
It's sad
and it's pathetic...

673
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,300
and it breaks my heart.

674
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:42,330
You don't think there are
monsters in this world?

675
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,600
You don't believe people
are evil?

676
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:52,060
I'll show you evil.

677
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,500
Well, you want me
to open one?

678
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,160
Joseph cepeda.

679
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,160
Wow.

680
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,600
Can i touch?

681
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,130
Okay.

682
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,160
This isn't exactly the reaction
i was looking for.

683
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,460
Well, i've never seen anything
like this before.

684
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,860
You're not disgusted...

685
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,530
appalled, horrified?

686
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,530
It's...

687
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,530
incredible.

688
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,160
But the person
who did this...

689
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,130
is a person just like me,

690
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,560
Like you.

691
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,300
We're all good, dexter,

692
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,700
And we're all evil.

693
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,000
I thought i closed the door

694
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,230
To anyone ever seeing me
for who i am,

695
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,330
But this woman sees me.

696
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,860
She doesn't know it,

697
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,530
But she's looking
behind the mask,

698
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,900
And she's not turning away.

699
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,330
You really impressed me
in there today, son.

700
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,330
I don't know how you did it,
but great job.

701
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,430
I just pretended to be
someone else.

702
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,900
Well, it's working.
Keep doing it.

703
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,730
I mean, that doctor didn't even
see the monster inside you.

704
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,160
I mean, not monster.

705
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,600
It's just, son, you know
that you have these dark urges.

706
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,400
Anyway, good job.

707
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,760
And somehow,
even under all this pressure,

708
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,560
She's able to make me feel okay
about who i am and what i am.

709
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,330
So...

710
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,500
...see you soon?

711
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,000
Yes.

712
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,200
I'm here for you.

713
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,500
I've already told you
everything.

714
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:20,930
I know. I'm sorry.

715
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,100
I came here to apologize.

716
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,860
You were very rude.

717
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,860
I was.

718
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,660
It was shameful of me

719
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,130
To disgrace the memory
of your husband.

720
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,860
Thank you.

721
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,300
It's been a rough few days,

722
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:46,700
Not that you should care
about that, but...

723
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:50,200
you know,
all these bodies -

724
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,800
I've never seen anything
like it.

725
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:57,400
All murdered...

726
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:00,530
cut into pieces.

727
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,660
The only way i could
make sense out of it

728
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,130
Was to convince myself
that they deserved it.

729
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,830
They all needed
to be bad people.

730
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,000
But i should never have
taken it out on you.

731
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,030
Can you feel it?

732
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,860
The breeze?

733
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,360
Coming over the water?

734
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,530
It's nice.

735
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,330
Yeah.

736
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,330
It's finally cooling down.

737
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,100
Have a nice evening.

738
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,830
Wait.

739
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,800
My husband -

740
00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:00,130
He kept guns hidden
in the walls.

741
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,160
I can show you.

742
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,700
I've never broken into my own
place of employment,

743
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,730
But desperate times...

744
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,830
garbagemen can be so careless.

745
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,860
I say put this bay harbor
butcher on the city payroll.

746
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,030
Give him a corner office,
a company car,

747
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,830
And all the ammunition
he needs.

748
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,800
At least somebody is doing
something to clean up miami,

749
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:03,330
Which is more than i can say

750
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,400
For those folks
down at city hall.

751
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:15,360
Hey, debra.

752
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,430
Hi.

753
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,400
Sorry about last night.

754
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,700
Don't be.

755
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:26,560
Maybe we can, uh,
do it again.

756
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,560
How would you feel
about a real date -

757
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,130
You know, with clothes on?

758
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,030
Where we actually talk
and get to know each other?

759
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,330
Something like that.

760
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,730
Sounds good.
How about saturday?

761
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,860
Deal.

762
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,700
Pick you up at 8:00.

763
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,560
And with us right now,

764
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,200
We have psychologist
sandy ramos

765
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,830
To provide insight into
the bay harbor butcher -

766
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,700
Evil serial killer
or avenging force for good?

767
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,000
This is the last time.

768
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,960
Bertrand?

769
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,930
Babe, come on.
You don't mean that.

770
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,260
No, i do mean it.
I do.

771
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,900
I can't see you anymore.

772
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:21,730
Wait, wait, wait, wait, no.
No, wait, no.

773
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,200
I don't understand, maria.

774
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:26,560
This - This is done.

775
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,860
She's gone.
It's over with.

776
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,460
We can finally be out
in the open.

777
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,930
Just you and me, okay?

778
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,930
Just like what we wanted.

779
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,830
No, bertrand, stop.

780
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:45,330
Stop it.
Stop, stop, stop. Stop!

781
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:50,430
Go back to esmee.

782
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,700
So, what,
this is how it is?

783
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,700
You get your job back,

784
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,500
And now you - You're -
You're through with me?

785
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:03,900
Look, don't play the victim.

786
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:06,100
You knew what this was
from the beginning.

787
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,260
You are one coldhearted bitch,
i'll tell you that.

788
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,000
No, you don't get
to tell me anything!

789
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:19,200
I am not the piece of shit
fucking another woman

790
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,430
Behind his fianc?E's back!

791
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,730
You try and judge me,
asshole.

792
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,260
You don't know
the first thing about me.

793
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,760
Yeah, so,
i think i misjudged lila.

794
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,430
Are you sure?

795
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,760
I mean,
she's unconventional,

796
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,430
But i think she's the best
sponsor... for me.

797
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,460
Well, if she can help
keep you clean.

798
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,330
Chop, chop, chop, chop,
chop, chop, chop, chop!

799
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,600
Whoa, who's this?
Could it be robin hood?

800
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:03,960
No, i'm the butcher man!

801
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,200
I made it for him.

802
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:08,000
I thought it might help
with the nightmares.

803
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,260
Bet you didn't know
you could fly.

804
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:22,260
Have i misjudged lila?
I have no idea.

805
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,460
I do know she's helping me look
at myself in a different way.

806
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,000
He's good, that one.

807
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,560
I know.
I got lucky.

808
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,960
Quite an actor.

809
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,300
He's hiding something.
I'm sure of it.

810
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:51,030
For example,
we find the genus nitzschia,

811
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:54,030
And we know we're talking
about a freshwater marina,

812
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,800
And the algae
can tell us more

813
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:58,230
About what kind of pollutants
are in the water,

814
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,660
Which would even further
narrow...

815
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:20,130
damn it!

816
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:23,530
For the first time,

817
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,560
I feel the future might hold
something different for me.

818
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,760
It's possible
i'm just fooling myself,

819
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,960
But i'm willing
to take the risk.

820
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,200
Fucking garbagemen.

821
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:38,330
Oh?

822
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,760
Broke the
refrigeration unit.

823
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,360
It blew hot air all night.

824
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,160
It turned the bodies
into pink mush.

825
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,500
How awful!

826
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:47,930
Completely ruined.

827
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,330
You brought your marine
biologist and everything.

828
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,630
Yeah.
It made him vomit.

829
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,130
Anyway, good thing the heat
didn't affect the rocks.

830
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,260
Lundy had us store them
separately.

831
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,900
The rocks?

832
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:10,260
Yeah. The algae we found
on the rocks.

833
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,260
The bay harbor butcher used them
to weigh his bags down.

834
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,330
We're assuming he picked them up
where he docks his boat.

835
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,700
But i thought
the marine biologist

836
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:24,330
Came to examine the bodies.

837
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,830
No. No, it's all about
the rocks, baby.

838
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,330
Manny took him to his lab.

839
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,800
Should have results
in a week or so.

840
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:33,860
That should help us narrow down
what marina they came from.

841
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,460
It's an odd sensation
to be experiencing

842
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,900
What might be called hope
for the first time in my life.

843
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,230
At the same time,

844
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,400
I suddenly find myself
weighing the benefits

845
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:46,560
Of electrocution
versus lethal injection.

846
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,260
But here i am.
