00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:49,541
Dexter: WHAT'S THIS BIG BREAK
IN THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER CASE

6
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:50,608
I KEEP HEARING ABOUT?

7
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:52,209
Debra: MASUKA FOUND
MICROSCOPIC ALGAE

8
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:54,075
INSIDE THE GARBAGE BAGS
WITH THE BODY.

9
00:01:54,108 --> 00:01:55,708
IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE ROCKS, BABY.

10
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,690
THE ROCKS?

11
00:01:56,691 --> 00:01:58,214
YEAH, THE ALGAE WE FOUND
ON THE ROCKS.

12
00:01:58,215 --> 00:02:00,915
THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER USED THEM
TO WEIGH HIS BAGS DOWN.

13
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:03,179
WE'RE ASSUMING HE PICKED THEM UP
WHERE HE DOCKS HIS BOAT.

Dexter:
OCTOBER 3, 1973 --

LAURA MOSER
AND THREE OTHERS FOUND

16
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:07,694
CHOPPED UP
WITH A CHAIN SAW.

17
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:09,182
APPARENTLY A DRUG DEALER
DIDN'T APPRECIATE

18
00:02:09,183 --> 00:02:11,036
LAURA AND HER FRIENDS
STEALING HIS COCAINE.

19
00:02:11,513 --> 00:02:13,773
WHAT IS IN THAT REPORT THAT
HARRY DIDN'T WANT ME TO SEE?!

20
00:02:13,774 --> 00:02:15,147
YOU WERE LEFT THERE
FOR DAYS,

21
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:18,875
STARVING,
IN BLOOD TWO INCHES THICK.

22
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:22,664
DEXTER,
THIS IS MY MOTHER.
GAIL.

23
00:02:23,064 --> 00:02:25,746
HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.
I'M SURE OF IT.

24
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,042
DID YOU KILL YOUR WIFE?

25
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:29,933
YEAH.

26
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:31,545
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT,

27
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:39,152
DEBRA, ACTUALLY.

28
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:40,839

OH, YOU'RE INTO THE KINKY STUFF,
HUH?

30
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:45,949

I'M GONNA HELP THE TWO OF YOU

YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME ALL

IS A PERSON JUST LIKE ME...

38
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,307

39
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:14,723

00:04:09,653 --> 00:04:11,272
SO WHAT,
JUST CHOP THEM ALL UP?

61
00:04:11,402 --> 00:04:12,732
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU'RE A GODSEND.

69
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:41,301
OH, SWEET MARY,
MOTHER OF FUCK, THAT'S GOOD!

70
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:43,854
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE
BROKEN A COMMANDMENT
SOMEWHERE IN THERE.

71
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,969
BURNING THE LATE-NIGHT OIL
WITH THE TASK FORCE?

72

HARDLY -- TILL WE GET THE REPORT
BACK ON THE ALGAE,

73
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:52,497

BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA.

104
00:06:21,935 --> 00:06:23,855
THE BLOOD SPATTER HERE
ON THE COUNTER

105
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:26,707
SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS WHERE
THE INITIAL BLOW OCCURRED.

106
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,496
IMPACT SPATTER
IS CONSISTENT

107

119
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,748
NO, I GOT IT COVERED.

120
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:02,544

I'M CONDUCTING
AN INTERVIEW HERE, MORGAN.

133
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:45,705
DENNY WAS TRYING TO SET UP

134
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:47,131

141
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:22,333
THE FIRST TIME I GOT HIGH,
I WAS 15.

142
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:26,395
NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
I WAS 14.

143
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:28,367
NO, WAIT.

144
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:33,060
I WAS DEFINITELY 15 BECAUSE
IT WAS MY FRESHMAN YEAR.

145
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,626
I REMEMBER NOW BECAUSE I WAS
DATING SUSIE MITCHELL.

146
00:08:37,923 --> 00:08:40,115
WE BROKE UP 'CAUSE I CALLED HER

147

SHE HATED WHEN PEOPLE DID THAT.

149
00:08:45,956 --> 00:08:49,105
WHAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW WAS
THAT I HAD A THING FOR SHARON.

150
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:53,044
SHARON DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING
TO DO WITH ME, SO...

00:10:51,314 --> 00:10:55,599
HAVE YOU THOUGHT MAYBE YOU
WEREN'T SAVING YOUR MOTHER

172
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,705
IN THIS DREAM?

173
00:10:57,245 --> 00:10:58,711
MAYBE YOU WERE
SAVING YOURSELF.

174
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,464
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

175
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:03,449
DON'T BE SO SURE.

176
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:04,966
WHEN I GOT CLEAN,

177
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,881
ALL THE SERIOUSLY
FUCKED-UP REASONS I USED

178
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:08,752
IN THE FIRST PLACE
BEGAN TO SURFACE.

179
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:11,719
THIS COULD BE WHERE
YOUR ADDICTION STARTED.

180
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,810
I HOPE WHOEVER DID IT
GOT THE BLOODY CHAIR.

181
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,656
THERE WERE THREE MEN.

182
00:11:26,878 --> 00:11:28,434
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO THEM.

183
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:33,197
DEXTER, IF THESE GUYS
ARE BEHIND BARS,

184
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:34,650
YOU NEED TO CONFRONT THEM.

185
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:37,292
IF THEY'RE DEAD, HELL,
GO PISS ON THEIR GRAVES,

186
00:11:37,293 --> 00:11:39,191
BUT YOU NEED TO DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES

187
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:40,690
SO YOU CAN GET CLOSURE.

188
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:44,456
HOW ELSE DO YOU EXPECT
TO GET BETTER?

189
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:47,685
I NEVER EXPECTED
TO GET BETTER.

190
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:14,160
MY METH LAB'S
IN THE SOCK DRAWER.

191
00:12:16,982 --> 00:12:18,381
THIS LOOKS BAD,
DOESN'T IT?

192
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:19,594
YEAH.

193
00:12:19,595 --> 00:12:20,904
THE CUTE PANTIES HELP.

194
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,910
WOULD YOU BELIEVE I'M TRYING
TO GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER?

195
00:12:24,098 --> 00:12:25,984
BY RIFLING
THROUGH MY STUFF?

196
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:31,491
I'M RETARDED.

197
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,812
AND YOU'VE BEEN SO GREAT.

198
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,678
YOU KNOW HOW I TOLD YOU
THE LAST GUY I HAD SEX WITH

199
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,958
TRIED TO KILL ME?

200
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:51,823
WELL, THAT WAS
KIND OF TRUE.

201
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:56,419
HE WAS
THE ICE-TRUCK KILLER.

202
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:00,040
WHO IS HE?

203
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:06,151
NOT FUCKING FUNNY.

204
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,420
COME ON, DEB.
I NEVER HEARD OF HIM BEFORE.

205
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,635
STOP IT.
DON'T SCREW WITH ME.

206
00:13:09,636 --> 00:13:11,714
DEB, I'VE BEEN
IN EL SALVADOR

207
00:13:11,715 --> 00:13:13,402
VISITING FAMILY
FOR SIX MONTHS.

208
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,686
I JUST GOT BACK.

209
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:22,663
YOU SOUND LIKE EVERY OTHER
JACKASS OUT THERE WHO THINKS...

210
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:24,955
I'M A TROPHY FUCK.

211
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,393
YOU HAD NO IDEA WHO I WAS
WHEN YOU HIT ON ME AT THE GYM?

212
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:32,685
WHEN I HIT ON YOU
AT THE GYM,

213
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:35,011
IT WAS BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU WERE HOT.

214
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:46,368
GOOD ANSWER.

215
00:14:04,591 --> 00:14:06,084
SO, WHAT'S HOT ABOUT ME?

216
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:09,979
IT'S IN THE CORNER!
DON'T HURT IT!

217
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,133
OH, GOD, DEXTER,
BE CAREFUL.

218
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:13,442
USE A BROOM.
IT MIGHT HAVE RABIES.

219
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:16,611
OH, IT'S RIGHT THERE!
GET IT!

220
00:14:16,745 --> 00:14:17,768
WATCH IT!

221
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,047
CAREFUL.

222
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:24,241
YAY! ALL RIGHT!
HE GOT IT!

223
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:25,231
YAY!

224
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:27,921
MY HERO.

225
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:32,056
ALL RIGHT, KIDS.
SHOW'S OVER.

226
00:14:32,187 --> 00:14:33,786
COME ON.
LET'S GET DRESSED FOR SCHOOL.

227
00:14:42,135 --> 00:14:44,882
SO, ANY ARMADILLOS
IN MICHIGAN?

228
00:14:46,127 --> 00:14:47,103
NO.

229
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,430
WE DIDN'T USED TO HAVE ANY
IN FLORIDA.

230
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,936
NOW IT'S LIKE AN INVASION.
"ARMADILLOS ATTACK!"

231
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:56,506
YOU THINK YOU'RE CHARMING,
DON'T YOU?

232
00:14:57,788 --> 00:14:59,910
I'M SURE THAT PROBABLY WORKS
FOR YOU MOST OF THE TIME.

233
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:00,934
IT DID FOR PAUL.

234
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:04,514
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.

235
00:15:06,243 --> 00:15:07,469
CONFUSED?

236
00:15:09,781 --> 00:15:11,189
I FOUND THESE
IN A DRAWER.

237
00:15:11,756 --> 00:15:12,927
TELL ME, DEXTER,

238
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,860
WHY WOULD RITA PRINT OUT
NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS LITERATURE

239
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:16,853
IF PAUL'S DEAD?

240
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:22,102
BECAUSE RECENTLY
I ENTERED THE PROGRAM.

241
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,496
I KNEW IT.

242
00:15:24,497 --> 00:15:26,713
I WOULD NEVER HURT RITA
LIKE PAUL DID.

243
00:15:26,714 --> 00:15:28,673
BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU
THAT CHANCE.

244
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:30,201
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME

245
00:15:30,202 --> 00:15:32,430
BEFORE YOU PULL HER UNDER
JUST LIKE HE DID.

246
00:15:33,194 --> 00:15:34,956
HAVE YOU DISCUSSED ANY OF THIS
WITH RITA?

247
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,952
NO, BUT I WILL IF YOU DON'T
DO THE RIGHT THING HERE.

248
00:15:38,628 --> 00:15:42,357
IF YOU TRULY CARE ABOUT THIS
FAMILY LIKE YOU SAY YOU DO,

249
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,693
YOU WILL LET MY DAUGHTER
AND THOSE SWEET CHILDREN GO.

250
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:52,519
THE ALGAE ON THE ROCKS WAS
EXPOSED TO BOTH ZINC AND LEAD.

251
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,992
THERE ARE ONLY THREE MARINAS
NEAR BAY HARBOR

252
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,750
WHICH HAVE RESTRICTED
WATER FLOW

253
00:15:56,965 --> 00:15:58,708
THAT WOULD ACCOUNT
FOR SUCH HIGH LEVELS

254
00:15:58,717 --> 00:16:00,295
OF THESE SPECIFIC
POLLUTANTS --

255
00:16:00,804 --> 00:16:04,726
TURKEY CREEK, SUNSET KEYS,
AND CORAL COVE.

256
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:06,338
ANYONE FAMILIAR
WITH THESE MARINAS?

257
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:09,937
CORAL COVE IS WHERE MY DAD
KEPT OUR FAMILY BOAT.

258
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:11,380
MY BROTHER USES THE SLIP NOW.

259
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:13,253
I'LL BET HALF THE FORCE
HAS BOATS OUT THERE.

260
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:15,396
IT'S ONE OF THE FEW
MARINAS LEFT

261
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:17,491
THAT'S AFFORDABLE
ON A COP'S SALARY.

262
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:20,059
MORGAN AND I WILL
TAKE THAT ONE.

263
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,451
SODOQUIST AND LEE,
TURKEY CREEK IS YOURS.

264
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:24,886
AND, HILL AND RAMOS,
YOU'VE GOT SUNSET KEYS.

265
00:16:24,894 --> 00:16:27,065
THE REST OF YOU WILL STAY HERE
WITH DETECTIVE BATISTA.

266
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:28,797
WHEN THE TEAM REPORTS IN,

267
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:30,236
RELAY THE INFORMATION
BACK TO ME.

268
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:33,187
IF OUR KILLER'S BOAT IS OUT
THERE, LET'S FIND IT.

269
00:16:38,317 --> 00:16:39,424
SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG.

270
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:41,493
COULDN'T SEEM TO FIND
ANY OTHER CRIME SCENE FILES.

271
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:42,998
PROBABLY LOST IN STORAGE
SOMEWHERE.

272
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:45,216
ANYWAY, THAT'S WHAT I WAS ABLE
TO DIG UP.

273
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:46,489
JUST ONE FILE?

274
00:16:46,646 --> 00:16:48,774
THERE WERE THREE MEN ARRESTED
FOR THOSE MURDERS.

275
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:49,760
WELL, ONE'S DECEASED,

276
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:51,438
ONE'S DOING LIFE
WITHOUT POSSIBILITY,

277
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,484
AND THAT'S THE ONLY ONE
THAT'S STILL AN OPEN CASE --

278
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:55,244
SANTOS JIMINEZ.

279
00:16:55,986 --> 00:16:57,339
WHY'S IT AN OPEN CASE?

280
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:58,921
JIMINEZ TURNED
STATE'S EVIDENCE,

281
00:16:58,922 --> 00:17:00,309
WENT INTO WITNESS
PROTECTION.

282
00:17:00,623 --> 00:17:02,438
THERE'S A BUSINESS ADDRESS
IN THERE FOR HIM.

283
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:04,740
I GUESS AFTER 34 YEARS,

284
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:06,945
HE FIGURES ALL THE PEOPLE
WHO WANT HIM DEAD ARE LONG GONE.

285
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:08,663
 <i>HE FIGURED WRONG.</i>

286
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:10,224
IF YOU CAN'T FIND
WHAT YOU NEED,

287
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:12,368
THERE'S AUDIO TAPES
CROSS-REFERENCED WITH THIS FILE.

288
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:14,713
TAPES?
YEAH, SEE THAT NOTATION?

289
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:17,412
THERE WAS A CRIMINAL INFORMANT
WORKING A COCAINE BUST

290
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:18,408
FROM THE INSIDE.

291
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:21,796
I'LL TAKE THIS, TOO.

292
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,747
OKAY.

293
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:25,814
 <i>HARRY ALWAYS SAID,</i>
 <i>"NEVER MAKE THINGS PERSONAL --</i>

294
00:17:26,048 --> 00:17:27,706
 <i>CLOUDS YOUR JUDGEMENT."</i>

295
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:30,055
 <i>BUT I'VE BEEN LIVING IN A FOG</i>
 <i>WAY TOO LONG.</i>

296
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,158
Harry: <i>TODAY IS FRIDAY,</i>
 <i>SEPTEMBER 28, 1973.</i>

297
00:17:33,472 --> 00:17:35,020
 <i>THIS IS DETECTIVE</i>
 <i>HARRY MORGAN.</i>

298
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:37,629

299

 <i>CASE FILE --</i>

 <i>I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.</i>

304
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:50,997
HARRY, I'M SO SCARED.

305
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:54,109
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
YOU JUST NEED TO CALM DOWN.

306
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:56,078
I ALREADY TOOK THE COCAINE
AS EVIDENCE,

307
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,484
JUST LIKE YOU ASKED --
WHY ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

308
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:00,974
IF WE WANT ESTRADA AND HIS MEN
BEHIND BARS,

309
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:04,178
WE HAVE TO CATCH THEM IN THE ACT
AT THE SHIPYARD.

310
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:07,567
HE'S GONNA FIND OUT,
AND THEN HE'S GONNA KILL ME.

311
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:10,516
HARRY, LISTEN TO ME.

312
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,777
I THINK SOMEONE MAY HAVE
FOLLOWED US TO THE PARK.

313
00:18:14,201 --> 00:18:16,413
IF WE WERE FOLLOWED,
I WOULD HAVE NOTICED.

314
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:20,266
I JUST NEED YOU TO HOLD OUT
A LITTLE LONGER.

315
00:18:21,656 --> 00:18:23,116
THIS WILL ALL BE OVER SOON.

316
00:18:25,924 --> 00:18:27,548
I NEED TO PICK UP BRIAN
AT SCHOOL.

317
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,687
I WON'T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN
TO YOU...

318
00:18:30,268 --> 00:18:31,619
OR YOUR BOYS.

319
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:37,583
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

320
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:41,861
 <i>HARRY BROKE HIS WORD.</i>

321
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:44,683
 <i>HE WASN'T CALLED TO</i>
 <i>THAT CRIME SCENE BY CHANCE.</i>

322
00:18:45,212 --> 00:18:46,455

 <i>LAURA MOSER WAS HIS INFORMANT.</i>

324
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,332
HARRY KNEW MY MOTHER.

325
00:18:53,985 --> 00:18:58,667
OUR SUSPECT IS 6'2",
380 POUNDS, HISPANIC,

326
00:18:58,668 --> 00:19:00,509
DRIVES A 1971 FORD PICKUP.

327
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:02,541
CIRCULATE HIS DMV PHOTO.

328
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:08,184
HEY.
HEY.

329
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:09,850
I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS.
ME TOO.

330
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,109
TURNS OUT OUR VIC, FOSTER --
HE HAD A BLOG.

331
00:19:13,457 --> 00:19:15,173
HE WAS IN SOME
ONLINE GEEK FLAME WAR

332
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:17,038
WITH A GUY CALLING HIMSELF
"CORNDUDE."

333
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:19,553
THE D.A. FINALLY SIGNED OFF
ON YOUR REVIEW.

334
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:21,641
THERE WON'T BE ANY CHARGES.

335
00:19:21,883 --> 00:19:24,353
THIS CORNDUDE'S REAL NAME
IS BENJAMIN ALVARO.

336
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:29,957
ANYONE FROM THE SHOOT
ROLL-OUT TEAM

337
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,302
TALK TO YOU
ABOUT COUNSELING?

338
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:32,838
WHY THE FUCK WOULD
I NEED COUNSELING?

339
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:35,826
'CAUSE YOU SHOT A MAN
LAST WEEK, JAMES.

00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,341
THAT'S TWO SHOOTINGS
IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS.

341
00:19:38,848 --> 00:19:40,388
COME ON,
IT'S GOT TO TAKE ITS TOLL.

342
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:42,790
I'M FINE,
BUT THANKS ANYWAY.

343
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:45,210
THE SUSHI PLACE NEXT DOOR
HAS A SECURITY CAMERA

344
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:46,765
THAT COVERS THE PARKING LOT.

345
00:19:48,024 --> 00:19:51,286
YOU KNOW, DEPARTMENT'S
CHAPLAIN'S GOT A GOOD EAR.

346
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:52,898
MARIA, CAN WE STAY
ON THE GODDAMN POINT?

347
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:54,317
THE CAMERA CAUGHT
THE LICENSE PLATE

348
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,439
OF A
GREEN-AND-WHITE PICKUP.

349
00:19:55,474 --> 00:19:57,077
IT BELONGS TO ALVARO.

350
00:19:57,455 --> 00:19:59,544
TIMECODE PUTS HIM HERE
AFTER THE SHOP CLOSED.

351
00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:03,406
SO SEND SOME UNIs TO STAKE OUT
ALVARO'S HOUSE,

352
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:05,393
AND YOU AND I WILL TAKE
WHERE HE WORKS.

353
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:07,210
NO, IT'S OKAY.
I'VE GOT SIMMS AND GILES ON IT.

354
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:08,901
I GOT BACKUP.
COME ON!

355
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:10,949
IT WILL BE LIKE OLD TIMES.

356
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:17,120
NINA, I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM MY ATTORNEY.

357
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,781
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT
THIS VISITATION BULLSHIT.

358
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:22,368
CAN YOU JUST TRY DEXTER'S
OFFICE AGAIN?

359
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:24,564
MISS,
HE'S NOT PICKING UP.

360
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:26,138
CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS.

361
00:20:26,187 --> 00:20:28,998
EXCUSE ME.
ARE YOU A FRIEND OF DEXTER'S?

362
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:32,095
I'M, UH, HIS DECORATOR.

363
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:33,738
LOVE THE HAT.

364
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:37,878
TERRENCE, UH, GIVE HER
A VISITOR'S BADGE.

365
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,958
I'LL --
I'LL TAKE HER UP.

366
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:42,360
ANGEL BATISTA.
I'M DEXTER'S BEST FRIEND.

367
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:45,264
NICE TO MEET YOU...
ANGEL BATISTA.

368
00:20:53,522 --> 00:20:55,343
 <i>MY WORK REQUIRES ME</i>
 <i>TO BE AN EXPERT</i>

369
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:57,087
 <i>IN ANALYZING PATTERNS.</i>

370
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,029
 <i>NOW A PATTERN KEEPS EMERGING</i>
 <i>FROM MY PAST</i>

371
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,451
 <i>THAT'S ALL TOO FAMILIAR --</i>

372
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:04,784
 <i>HARRY LYING TO ME.</i>

373
00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:07,659
 <i>NO WONDER HE DESTROYED THE FILE</i>
 <i>ON MY MOTHER'S DEATH.</i>

374
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,047
 <i>IT WASN'T TO PROTECT ME.</i>
 <i>IT WAS TO BURY HIS OWN GUILT.</i>

375
00:21:12,894 --> 00:21:14,226
Batista:
LOOK WHO I FOUND.

376
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:20,502
LISTEN, WHEN YOU'RE DONE
WITH HIM,

377
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:22,495
MAYBE YOU CAN COME OVER
TO MY PLACE.

378
00:21:23,176 --> 00:21:25,357
IT'S A MESS.
NEEDS A WOMAN'S TOUCH.

379
00:21:25,428 --> 00:21:26,277
YEAH?

380
00:21:32,632 --> 00:21:33,984
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ANGEL?

381
00:21:34,702 --> 00:21:37,665
DEXTER,
THESE ARE AMAZING!

382
00:21:37,793 --> 00:21:39,368
LILA,
YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE.

383
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:43,534
DID YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE MEN RESPONSIBLE

384
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:44,931
FOR YOUR MOTHER'S MURDER?

385
00:21:46,762 --> 00:21:49,588
DEAD OR IN PRISON --
EXCEPT FOR ONE.

386
00:21:50,388 --> 00:21:53,324
HE CUT A DEAL.
NOW HE LIVES IN NAPLES, FLORIDA.

387
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:54,608
HE RUNS A TAVERN.

388
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,742
AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT IT?

389
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:05,107
NOT SURE YET.

390
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:08,991
AND YOU'RE NOT
THE LEAST BIT PISSED OFF

391
00:22:08,992 --> 00:22:10,669
THAT THIS MAN GOT AWAY
WITH MURDER?

392
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,603
NO.

393
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:16,182
YOU SURE?

394
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,195
MAYBE A LITTLE.

395
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:20,701
THEN GO AND TELL HIM.

396
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:24,852
HEALING IS ALL ABOUT
FOCUSING YOUR RAGE

397
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:26,464
ON THE PERSON
THAT'S HURT YOU.

398
00:22:28,287 --> 00:22:29,876
NAPLES IS, WHAT...

399
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:31,496
TWO HOURS AWAY?

400
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:32,679
WE COULD GO TONIGHT.

401
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:35,815
OKAY.

402
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:37,577
PICK ME UP AFTER WORK?

403
00:22:37,578 --> 00:22:38,555
ALL RIGHT.

404
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:41,583
CAN I HAVE ONE OF THESE?

405
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:42,637
SURE.

406
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:52,925
WHAT IS THIS STUFF?

407
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:55,346
IT'S CORN SYRUP AND DYE.

408
00:22:55,347 --> 00:22:56,526
IT'S MY OWN RECIPE.

409
00:23:00,903 --> 00:23:02,451
MMM. NOT BAD.

410
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,640
THANK YOU.

411
00:23:14,046 --> 00:23:15,293
OH, GOD!

412
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:17,346
WHO DOESN'T FIX
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

413
00:23:17,347 --> 00:23:18,754
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH.

414
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:22,585
SO, I'M THINKING WE'RE ASSUMING
OUR KILLER OWNS A BOAT,

415
00:23:22,586 --> 00:23:23,461
BUT WHAT IF HE --

416
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:32,579
HOW DO YOU STAND
THIS MIAMI HEAT?

417
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:35,511
MAKES MY TOES SWELL UP.

418
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:39,175
OH, SO, ANYWAY,

419
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:41,244
I WAS THINKING, WHAT IF THE
KILLER'S BEEN RENTING A BOAT?

420
00:23:41,374 --> 00:23:42,714
I CAN CROSS-REFERENCE
SOME NAMES OF --

421
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:44,712
YOU LIKE CUCUMBER SANDWICHES,
OFFICER MORGAN?

422
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,071
I-I DON'T KNOW.

423
00:23:47,072 --> 00:23:49,964
ANYWAY, UH, WE HAVE
SOME OF THE DATES

424
00:23:49,965 --> 00:23:51,505
OF WHEN THE VICTIMS
WENT MISSING.

425
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:54,684
IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE CREAM CHEESE.

426
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,880
SO WE COULD CROSS-REFERENCE
THOSE DATES

427
00:23:57,881 --> 00:23:59,012
AGAINST THE RENTAL LOGS,

428
00:23:59,013 --> 00:24:00,507
AND MAYBE THE SAME NAMES
WILL POP UP.

429
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,012
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING
I JUST SAID?

430
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:08,435
NOT ONE WORD.

431
00:24:11,305 --> 00:24:12,589
IT'S 1:00.

432
00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:15,446
I ALWAYS STOP AND EAT LUNCH
AT 1:00.

433
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,229
YOU'LL LEARN THAT ABOUT ME.

434
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:19,738
WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN?

435
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:23,934
YOU'RE WELCOME TO CONSIDER IT
AN ORDER IF THAT HELPS.

436
00:24:34,756 --> 00:24:35,934
THE SHOES, TOO.

437
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,934
SHOULDN'T WE BE --

438
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:41,845
I DON'T KNOW --
INVESTIGATING THE AREA?

439
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,810
YOU'RE VERY FIDGETY.

440
00:24:45,524 --> 00:24:46,884
ANYONE EVER TELL YOU THAT?

441
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:49,698
YES. MY FATHER.

442
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,198
YOU APPLYING FOR THE JOB?

443
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:53,505
JUST AN OBSERVATION.

444
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,047
I'M SORRY.
I'M CONFUSED.

445
00:24:56,048 --> 00:24:58,366
ARE YOU CRITICIZING ME
FOR WANTING TO DO MY JOB?

446
00:24:58,367 --> 00:24:59,369
YES.

447
00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:01,640
IT'S 1:00.

448
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,273
LOOK, THE LAST TIME
I WAS AROUND BOATS,

449
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:09,999
A KILLER
WAS KIDNAPPING ME,

450
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,056
WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY
I'M LIVING WITH MY BROTHER

451
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:14,019
AND SNOOPING
ON MY NEW BOYFRIEND.

452
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,458
SO FORGIVE ME FOR BEING
A LITTLE FIDGETY,

453
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:18,452
BUT IF IT'S LUNCH
WE'RE TALKING,

454
00:25:18,453 --> 00:25:19,909
I'M GONNA EAT
A FAT PORK SANDWICH,

455
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,591
AND I'M SURE AS SHIT
NOT GONNA EAT IT HERE.

456
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,038
DEBRA.

457
00:25:24,078 --> 00:25:25,237
WHAT?!

458
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:27,939
THIS ISN'T
A COMMERCIAL MARINA.

459
00:25:28,164 --> 00:25:29,892
I HAVEN'T SEEN
A SINGLE RENTAL I.D.

460
00:25:29,893 --> 00:25:31,050
ON ANY OF THESE HULLS.

461
00:25:31,426 --> 00:25:34,132
BUT I <i>CAN</i> SEE THE UPKEEP
ON THIS PLACE IS DISMAL.

462
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:37,078
UNSECURE PERIMETER,
POOR LIGHTING.

463
00:25:38,065 --> 00:25:39,343
COME OUT HERE AT NIGHT,

464
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,074
NO ONE WOULD KNOW
WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE DOING.

465
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,584
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO ORDER
24-HOUR SURVEILLANCE

466
00:25:43,757 --> 00:25:45,631
ON THIS MARINA
AND THE TWO OTHERS.

467
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,832
AS SOON AS I FINISH
MY LUNCH.

468
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:15,398
AHH.

469
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:27,383
 <i>I FINISHED MY SPATTER REPORT,</i>
 <i>PUT IN FOR A PERSONAL DAY,</i>

470
00:26:27,482 --> 00:26:28,710
 <i>LEFT WORD WITH RITA.</i>

471
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,166
 <i>NAPLES, HERE I COME.</i>

472
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:34,192
 <i>I CAN'T REALLY FOCUS MY RAGE</i>

473
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,771
 <i>ON THE MAN</i>
 <i>WHO KILLED MY MOTHER,</i>

474
00:26:35,838 --> 00:26:37,687
 <i>NOT WITH LILA ALONG</i>
 <i>FOR THE RIDE.</i>

475
00:26:38,654 --> 00:26:40,836
 <i>BUT I CAN PREPARE FOR THE DAY</i>
 <i>WHEN I DO.</i>

476
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:42,739
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO
SO EARLY?

477
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:45,388
UM, GETTING OUT OF TOWN
FOR THE NIGHT.

478
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,214
DON'T WAIT UP FOR ME.

479
00:26:47,215 --> 00:26:48,117
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK?

480
00:26:48,118 --> 00:26:50,105
THOUGHT I'D, YOU KNOW,
TAKE THE MINIVAN OUT

481
00:26:50,106 --> 00:26:51,420
ON THE OPEN ROAD.

482
00:26:52,206 --> 00:26:53,236
WHO ARE YOU?

483
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,919
GOOD NEWS IS YOU GOT THE PLACE
TO YOURSELF

484
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,761
IF YOU WANT TO TIE UP
GABRIEL AGAIN.

485
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:59,037
YEAH, THAT ONE NEVER
FUCKING GETS OLD.

486
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:00,030
CALL ME WHEN YOU GET BACK.

487
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:01,345
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT CORAL COVE.

488
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:03,304
WHAT ABOUT CORAL COVE?

489
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,633
THE ALGAE ON THE ROCKS
SENT US THERE.

490
00:27:06,944 --> 00:27:09,227
IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD SERIOUSLY
CONSIDER MOVING YOUR BOAT.

491
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:10,893
SECURITY OUT THERE
SUCKS ASS.

492
00:27:11,893 --> 00:27:13,245
 <i>THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT.</i>

493
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:18,364
 <i>THIS LITTLE GREEN ALGAE</i>
 <i>MAY AS WELL BE KRYPTONITE.</i>

494
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:20,826
 <i>IF IT'S EVER TRACED BACK TO ME,</i>
 <i>I'LL BE HELPLESS.</i>

495
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:26,174
IS THIS A RENTAL?

496
00:27:27,836 --> 00:27:30,079
NOPE, SHE'S ALL MINE.

497
00:27:33,307 --> 00:27:36,349
SO YOUR MINIVAN'S A SHE,
IS SHE?

498
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:39,000
YOUR GIRLFRIEND
MUST BE JEALOUS.

499
00:27:39,447 --> 00:27:41,691
IS SHE COOL
WITH YOU DOING THIS?

500
00:27:41,692 --> 00:27:42,828
I DIDN'T TELL HER.

501
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:47,992
RITA'S MOM FOUND OUT
I'M IN RECOVERY.

502
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:51,145
SHE WANTS ME TO LEAVE RITA
AND THE KIDS.

503
00:27:58,786 --> 00:28:00,037
SHE COULD BE RIGHT.

504
00:28:01,718 --> 00:28:03,380
I CAN'T ABANDON THEM.

505
00:28:03,705 --> 00:28:05,672
SO, WHAT ABOUT WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA SAY TO THIS GUY

506
00:28:05,673 --> 00:28:06,907
WHEN YOU GET THERE?

507
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,450
I'M SURE I'LL THINK
OF SOMETHING.

508
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:18,548
WHY DON'T YOU PRACTICE
ON ME?

509
00:28:20,693 --> 00:28:22,582
I'D...RATHER NOT.

510
00:28:24,884 --> 00:28:25,867

00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,908
I SAID GET OUT OF MY BAR.

686
00:40:17,909 --> 00:40:22,194
OKAY. JUST LET ME SAY WHAT
I NEED TO SAY, AND I'LL GO.

687
00:40:27,231 --> 00:40:28,489
YOU STOLE MY LIFE.

688
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:31,282
[ Chuckling ]
WHAT THE FUCK?

689
00:40:31,283 --> 00:40:33,192
YOU ARE REALLY BEGINNING
TO PISS ME OFF.

690
00:40:33,193 --> 00:40:35,096
I'M NOT THE PERSON
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE

691
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:37,255
BECAUSE YOU TOOK SOMEONE
FROM ME.

692
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,581
I WILL BEAT
YOUR FUCKING HEAD IN

693
00:40:41,582 --> 00:40:44,286
IF YOU DON'T WALK OUT THAT DOOR
RIGHT NOW!

694
00:40:45,447 --> 00:40:46,844
I TRIED LILA'S WAY.

695
00:40:57,207 --> 00:40:59,214
1973!

696
00:40:59,653 --> 00:41:00,727
AAH! AAH!

697
00:41:00,728 --> 00:41:01,847
AAH.

698
00:41:01,848 --> 00:41:03,230
THE PORT OF MIAMI!

699
00:41:03,908 --> 00:41:05,126
A SHIPPING CONTAINER!

700
00:41:05,982 --> 00:41:07,086
A CHAIN SAW!

701
00:41:08,264 --> 00:41:09,383
LAURA MOSER!

702
00:41:11,742 --> 00:41:14,379
YOU REMEMBER NOW?
YOU REMEMBER NOW?

703
00:41:21,805 --> 00:41:22,543
 <i>PUTA MADRE.</i>

704
00:41:32,986 --> 00:41:35,868
YOU GOT ME CONFUSED
WITH SOMEONE ELSE!

705
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:37,903
AAH!

706
00:41:38,143 --> 00:41:41,870
I KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE!
YOU MADE ME INTO WHAT I AM!

707
00:41:42,186 --> 00:41:44,310
OKAY! I-I KILLED HER.

708
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,622
I HAD TO!

709
00:41:49,623 --> 00:41:51,222
DID YOU?
DID YOU HAVE TO?

710
00:41:51,328 --> 00:41:53,417
DID YOU HAVE TO SAW HER
INTO LITTLE PIECES?!

711
00:41:53,705 --> 00:41:55,254
DID YOU HAVE TO LEAVE
TWO LITTLE BOYS

712
00:41:55,255 --> 00:41:57,268
SOAKING IN A POOL
OF THEIR MOTHER'S BLOOD?

713
00:41:57,912 --> 00:42:00,551
ESTRADA WOULD HAVE KILLED ME
IF I DIDN'T.

714
00:42:01,224 --> 00:42:03,622
YOU SLAUGHTERED HER
LIKE AN ANIMAL

715
00:42:03,623 --> 00:42:07,050
BECAUSE SHE STOLE
HIS PRECIOUS COCAINE.

716
00:42:07,051 --> 00:42:10,931
NO. WE FOUND OUT SHE WAS
A SNITCH FOR A COP.

717
00:42:11,253 --> 00:42:12,649
SHE WAS FUCKING HIM.

718
00:42:15,131 --> 00:42:16,113
WHICH COP?

719
00:42:16,114 --> 00:42:17,276
I DIDN'T KNOW HIS NAME.

720
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:20,395
I FOLLOWED THEM TO --
TO A PARK.

721
00:42:21,073 --> 00:42:24,925
 <i>MY MOTHER AND HARRY --</i>
 <i>THAT'S WHAT GOT HER KILLED?</i>

722
00:42:26,531 --> 00:42:27,935
I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU YET.

723
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,969
 <i>ISN'T THIS WHAT HEROES DO --</i>
 <i>AVENGE LOST LOVED ONES?</i>

724
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:42,437
WHAT?

725
00:42:43,552 --> 00:42:44,763
EVERYTHING OKAY?

726
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:48,414
Dexter, what's wrong?

727
00:42:50,015 --> 00:42:51,276
I THOUGHT I COULD RESIST.

728
00:42:52,674 --> 00:42:54,148
JESUS...ARE YOU USING?

729
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:57,347
NO, BUT I'M ABOUT TO.

730
00:42:58,552 --> 00:42:59,603
Tell me where you are

731
00:43:00,182 --> 00:43:03,180
and I'll get in a taxi
and I'll come get you.

732
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:05,513
I HAVE TO DO THIS.

733
00:43:06,326 --> 00:43:09,542
NO, YOU DON'T!
JUST TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE.

734
00:43:14,278 --> 00:43:15,404
YOU'LL BE TOO LATE.

735
00:43:15,405 --> 00:43:19,085
DON'T YOU BLOODY DO THIS.
YOU ARE STRONGER THAN THAT.

736
00:43:19,086 --> 00:43:20,174
I'M NOT!

737
00:43:20,608 --> 00:43:22,845
Yes, you fucking are.

738
00:43:23,365 --> 00:43:24,859
You've come this far.

739
00:43:26,149 --> 00:43:27,833
IF YOU TURN BACK NOW,

740
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:30,788
YOU'LL GO RIGHT BACK
TO THE WAY YOU WERE --

741
00:43:31,287 --> 00:43:34,288
hollow, angry,

742
00:43:35,044 --> 00:43:36,369
ALONE.

743
00:43:36,876 --> 00:43:40,180
I will get you through this.
I swear.

744
00:43:40,411 --> 00:43:42,201
JUST COME BACK TO ME.
OKAY?

745
00:44:07,685 --> 00:44:10,328
DEXTER?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

746
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:11,393
IT'S OKAY.

747
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,128
I DIDN'T...

748
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:23,712
Shh. IT'S OKAY.

749
00:44:24,316 --> 00:44:25,867
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU DID.

750
00:44:26,894 --> 00:44:28,247
IT'S OKAY.

751
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:36,169
IT'S OKAY.

752
00:44:38,063 --> 00:44:39,314
BABY.

753
00:44:40,715 --> 00:44:41,762
IT'S OKAY.

754
00:44:44,038 --> 00:44:45,504
WHAT ARE YOU STILL
DOING HERE?

755
00:44:46,576 --> 00:44:49,555
MAKING SURE OUR MARINA
SURVEILLANCE IS IN PLACE.

756
00:44:50,257 --> 00:44:51,087
YOU FORGET SOMETHING?

757
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,857
I'M WORKING UP
RENTAL LOGS...

758
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,865
...ON THE OTHER
TWO MARINAS.

759
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,255
YOU DON'T GIVE UP,
DO YOU?

760
00:44:57,367 --> 00:44:58,518
DO <i>YOU?</i>

761
00:45:00,703 --> 00:45:03,416
I'M WIDE AWAKE ANYWAY.
DEXTER'S OUT OF TOWN.

762
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:05,285
I DON'T REALLY SLEEP
WHEN I'M THERE BY MYSELF.

763
00:45:05,364 --> 00:45:06,723
WHAT ABOUT
THE NEW BOYFRIEND?

764
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,433
WE SORT OF BROKE UP.

765
00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:14,746
WELL,
I BROKE UP WITH HIM.

766
00:45:18,072 --> 00:45:19,950
GUESS YOU WON'T BE NEEDING
 <i>THIS,</i> THEN.

767
00:45:21,155 --> 00:45:22,151
WHAT'S THAT?

768
00:45:23,794 --> 00:45:25,034
BACKGROUND CHECK.

769
00:45:26,149 --> 00:45:28,331
YOU SAID YOU SERE SNOOPING.
JUST THOUGHT I'D HELP.

770
00:45:28,997 --> 00:45:31,550
YOU RAN A BACKGROUND CHECK
ON MY BOYFRIEND?

771
00:45:34,046 --> 00:45:35,225
WHAT'S IT SAY?

772
00:45:35,226 --> 00:45:37,744
GABRIEL'S CLEAN --

773
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:39,227
WELL, EXCEPT FOR THOSE
PARKING TICKETS.

774
00:45:42,057 --> 00:45:43,466
JUST BECAUSE HE'S NOT
A CRIMINAL

775
00:45:43,564 --> 00:45:44,812
DOESN'T MEAN HE'S NOT
AN ASSHOLE.

776
00:45:46,683 --> 00:45:47,973
I WENT THROUGH HIS E-MAIL.

777
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:50,697
I KNOW,
BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.

778
00:45:50,797 --> 00:45:54,400
I MEAN...HE WAS USING ME
TO SHOP AROUND A BOOK

779
00:45:54,401 --> 00:45:55,748
ABOUT THE ICE-TRUCK KILLER.

780
00:45:58,844 --> 00:46:01,585
DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF WRITER
GABRIEL IS?

781
00:46:09,538 --> 00:46:10,769
CHILDREN'S BOOKS?

782
00:46:15,867 --> 00:46:18,337
"THE ICE PRINCESS"
IS A CHILDREN'S BOOK.

783
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,354
HOW COULD I BE
SO FUCKING STUPID?

784
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:30,995
WHEN MY WIFE MET ME,
SHE WAS CONVINCED I WAS A SPY.

785
00:46:31,852 --> 00:46:34,718
CONNIE DIDN'T KNOW IT,
BUT SHE WAS ACTUALLY RIGHT.

786
00:46:35,451 --> 00:46:36,971
YOU RAN A BACKGROUND CHECK
ON HER?

787
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,085
[ CHUCKLES ]
NO NEED.

788
00:46:40,192 --> 00:46:43,674
MUST BE NICE...
TO JUST KNOW LIKE THAT.

789
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,104
SHE DIED...TWO YEARS AGO.

790
00:46:50,162 --> 00:46:51,255
CANCER.

791
00:46:52,953 --> 00:46:54,046
I'M SORRY.

792
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,453
THAT'S HOW I LOST MY MOM.

793
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:06,577
I SHOULD GO.

794
00:47:08,183 --> 00:47:09,381
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

795
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:11,863
THAT BOYFRIEND OF YOURS --

796
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:14,726
DID HE EVER GIVE YOU A REASON
NOT TO TRUST HIM?

797
00:47:15,305 --> 00:47:16,348
NO.

798
00:47:19,596 --> 00:47:21,059
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT MATTERS.

799
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,887
I MEAN,
I WENT INSANE ON HIM.

800
00:47:25,332 --> 00:47:26,667
HE'LL NEVER FORGIVE ME.

801
00:47:27,335 --> 00:47:29,142
ANY BROKEN BONES INVOLVED?

802
00:47:29,397 --> 00:47:30,747
FACIAL CONTUSIONS?

803
00:47:31,411 --> 00:47:32,431
NO.

804
00:47:34,335 --> 00:47:35,522
YOU'LL BE FINE.

805
00:48:14,337 --> 00:48:16,880
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW I GOT INTO THE PROGRAM?

806
00:48:25,985 --> 00:48:27,445
I'D USED FOR YEARS --

807
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:30,396
BINGE, CRASH.

808
00:48:31,573 --> 00:48:33,263
THOUGHT I HAD IT
UNDER CONTROL.

809
00:48:35,459 --> 00:48:37,073
THEN I MET MARCO.

810
00:48:38,921 --> 00:48:40,153
WHAT A SHIT.

811
00:48:43,381 --> 00:48:45,298
THOUGHT HE WAS MY BOYFRIEND,

812
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:47,635
BUT HE TURNED OUT
TO BE MY DEALER.

813
00:48:52,777 --> 00:48:56,241
BASTARD HAD ME SO STRUNG OUT
BY THE TIME HE LEFT,

814
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,725
NOTHING MATTERED.

815
00:49:01,059 --> 00:49:02,697
NOTHING WAS LEFT...

816
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,633
...BUT RAGE.

817
00:49:12,943 --> 00:49:14,158
ONE NIGHT...

818
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,281
I WAS SO FUCKED UP --
GOD.

819
00:49:21,419 --> 00:49:25,418
I WENT TO HIS HOUSE,
AND I BURNED IT TO THE GROUND.

820
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,377
WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT
MARCO WAS PASSED OUT INSIDE.

821
00:49:41,238 --> 00:49:43,607
THEY BLAMED THE FIRE
ON HIS DRUGS.

822
00:49:47,946 --> 00:49:49,206
BUT IT WAS ME.

823
00:49:53,235 --> 00:49:54,882
HE DIED BECAUSE OF ME.

824
00:50:01,157 --> 00:50:03,528
THAT NIGHT,
I WENT TO MY FIRST MEETING.

825
00:50:07,776 --> 00:50:11,206
SEEING THAT SIDE OF MYSELF
WAS TERRIFYING.

826
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,491
THAT I COULD POSSIBLY DO THAT
TO ANOTHER PERSON.

827
00:50:21,857 --> 00:50:23,408
DID HE DESERVE IT?

828
00:50:29,332 --> 00:50:30,703
YES.

829
00:50:48,194 --> 00:50:50,068
THEN YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

830
00:51:16,717 --> 00:51:18,145
HEY, YOU.

831
00:51:18,146 --> 00:51:20,385
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU
THIS EARLY.

832
00:51:20,516 --> 00:51:22,075
I DIDN'T HIT ANY TRAFFIC.

833
00:51:22,683 --> 00:51:24,682
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME
FOR BREAKFAST.

834
00:51:29,246 --> 00:51:30,363
WHERE'S YOUR MOM?

835
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:33,444
OH, I DOUBT SHE'LL BE
JOINING US.

836
00:51:33,936 --> 00:51:35,692
SHE'S BEEN IN HER ROOM
ALL MORNING.

837
00:51:36,392 --> 00:51:38,844
MY GUESS IS SHE'S PACKING.

838
00:51:42,405 --> 00:51:43,574
MAYBE I SHOULD GO.

839
00:51:44,806 --> 00:51:46,209
NO.

840
00:51:47,329 --> 00:51:48,486
NO, YOU'RE STAYING
RIGHT HERE

841
00:51:48,487 --> 00:51:50,230
BECAUSE YOU'RE A PART
OF THIS FAMILY.

842
00:51:52,842 --> 00:51:53,679
ARE YOU SURE?

843
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,469
I'VE PUT YOU THROUGH
SO MUCH LATELY.

844
00:51:59,327 --> 00:52:02,507
I'M HERE FOR YOU, DEXTER...
NO MATTER WHAT.

845
00:52:06,435 --> 00:52:07,518
WHAT'S THIS?

846
00:52:11,166 --> 00:52:12,560
THE PATCH.

847
00:52:13,345 --> 00:52:15,506
I HAVE SOME QUITTING
OF MY OWN TO DO.

848
00:52:16,593 --> 00:52:17,757
SIT.

849
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:23,902
IS THAT ANYTHING
IMPORTANT?

850
00:52:28,352 --> 00:52:29,565
NOPE.

851
00:52:32,614 --> 00:52:33,530
MORNING.

852
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:36,635
MORNING, DEXTER.

853
00:52:37,151 --> 00:52:38,785
HI...GAIL.

854
00:52:42,749 --> 00:52:46,366
SO, RITA ASSURES ME THAT YOU ARE
COMMITTED TO GETTING BETTER.

855
00:52:49,732 --> 00:52:51,003
I AM.

856
00:52:51,608 --> 00:52:53,279
THEN I WANT TO BE HERE
TO HELP.

857
00:52:54,448 --> 00:52:57,618
IN FACT, I'VE DECIDED
TO STAY IN MIAMI.

858
00:52:58,031 --> 00:52:59,907
I E-MAILED THE SCHOOL BOARD

859
00:52:59,908 --> 00:53:01,600
MY LETTER OF RESIGNATION
THIS MORNING.

860
00:53:03,078 --> 00:53:04,766
WHAT ABOUT YOUR HOUSE?

861
00:53:05,055 --> 00:53:06,373
I'LL PUT IT ON THE MARKET.

862
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,313
SWEETIE, I THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID LAST NIGHT.

863
00:53:09,805 --> 00:53:12,778
I <i>HAVEN'T</i> BEEN HERE FOR YOU,
AND I WANT TO CHANGE THAT.

864
00:53:16,339 --> 00:53:18,212
YOU KNOW, MY SISTER'S LOOKING
FOR A NEW APARTMENT.

865
00:53:18,213 --> 00:53:19,974
I'M SURE WE CAN HELP YOU
FIND ONE, TOO.

866
00:53:19,975 --> 00:53:21,908
WELL, DON'T BE SILLY.
I'LL BE LIVING HERE.

867
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,876
DEXTER, BE A DEAR AND PASS ME
THE CREAM, PLEASE.

868
00:53:27,306 --> 00:53:28,354
THANK YOU.

869
00:53:31,761 --> 00:53:33,403
 <i>HARRY TAUGHT ME TO LIE</i>

870
00:53:33,622 --> 00:53:36,287
 <i>AND KEEP MY DARKEST SECRETS</i>
 <i>FROM THOSE AROUND ME...</i>

871
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:38,835
 <i>WHICH IS WHY I NEED</i>
 <i>TO MAKE SURE</i>

872
00:53:38,836 --> 00:53:41,152
 <i>THERE'S NOT A TRACE</i>
 <i>OF BLOOD LEFT ON MY BOAT.</i>

873
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:45,119
 <i>HE ALSO TAUGHT ME</i>
 <i>NOT TO RUSH TO JUDGMENT.</i>

874
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:48,355
 <i>THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS</i>
 <i>WHAT THEY APPEAR TO BE...</i>

875
00:53:50,716 --> 00:53:52,155
 <i>...INCLUDING HARRY.</i>

876
00:53:52,818 --> 00:53:54,219
 <i>AND WHAT ABOUT ME?</i>

877
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,063
 <i>AM I THE TWISTED</i>
 <i>BAY HARBOR BUTCHER...</i>

878
00:53:57,844 --> 00:53:59,986
 <i>OR THE VALIANT DARK DEFENDER?</i>

879
00:54:01,009 --> 00:54:02,379
 <i>ONLY TIME WILL TELL.</i>

880
00:54:03,196 --> 00:54:06,153
 <i>FUNNY THING IS I'VE MET SOMEONE</i>
 <i>WHO DOESN'T CARE WHAT I AM.</i>

881
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:10,368
 <i>I SUPPOSE EVERY HERO</i>
 <i>NEEDS A SIDEKICK...</i>

882
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:13,403
 <i>EVERY VILLAIN,</i>
 <i>A PARTNER IN CRIME.</i>

883
00:54:16,529 --> 00:54:19,731
 <i>ALL MY RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN</i>
 <i>BUILT ON NOT KNOWING.</i>

884
00:54:21,194 --> 00:54:22,755
 <i>BUT THAT MAY BE CHANGING.</i>

885
00:54:27,712 --> 00:54:32,650
 <i>IMAGINE THAT --</i>
 <i>A LIFE WITH NO MORE SECRETS.</i>

886
