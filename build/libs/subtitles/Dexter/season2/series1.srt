1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:17,349
Blood. Sometimes it sets my teeth on edge,

2
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,893
other times it helps me control the chaos.

3
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,981
Last season on Dexter...

4
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,277
Tonight's the night
and it's going to happen again...and again.

5
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,238
Open your eyes
and look at what you did!

6
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,365
Please, you have to understand.

7
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,117
Trust me, I definitely understand.

8
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:38,120
Children - I could never do that, not like you.

9
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,497
- Why?
- I have standards.

10
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,294
- You'd better be a cop.
- No. Forensics.

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,129
- They found another hooker.
- Another?

12
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,380
The third in five months.

13
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,466
There's no blood near the body at all.

14
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,176
It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

15
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:56,305
I've never seen such
clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

16
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,973
How does he get rid of the blood?

17
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,184
I think this is a friendly message,

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,102
Kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

19
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,980
And, yes, I want to play. I really, really do.

20
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,232
What's this sick son of a bitch telling us?

21
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,817
Not us. Me.

22
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,152
Interesting hand job.

23
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:13,072
- Think this is our guy's work?
- The Ice-Truck Killer?

24
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,490
This feels familiar.

25
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,116
When he broke into my apartment,

26
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,536
he took some time to get to know me,
my life, my secrets.

27
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:23,624
He knows. He's not corrupting
the happy, Hallmark images of my youth.

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,418
He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

29
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,296
Son, there are people out there
who do really bad things.

30
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,299
Of course, you have to learn to spot them.
But I can teach you.

31
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,969
The code of Harry,
my foster father, is satisfied.

32
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,972
- So how the hell was your date with Rita?
- Great.

33
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,849
She's perfect because Rita is,

34
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,143
in her own way, as damaged as me.

35
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,938
- I want...
- A normal life.

36
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,648
Yeah, a normal life.

37
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,902
The killer is an artist.

38
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,113
You give me the fucking creeps,
you know that?

39
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,864
Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

40
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,991
Why, in a building full of cops,

41
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,745
is Doakes the only one
who gets the creeps from me?

42
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,664
I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.

43
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,915
Dex, Rudy's different.

44
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,543
I feel safe with him.
I think I'm falling for him.

45
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,337
Dexter.

46
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,840
I've waited a long time to meet you.

47
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,883
Dad's coming home?

48
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,344
If their dad shows up,
we'll deal with it together.

49
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,847
Paul Bennett, father on parole.

50
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,348
Are you fucking my wife?

51
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,685
My heart beats for those two kids,

52
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,521
so if you or that skinny bitch
try to screw with what's mine,

53
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,731
I swear to God,
I don't care who I have to hurt.

54
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,609
Let's face it, Paul, you've been a problem.

55
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,153
It's time for you to go away.

56
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,405
He smacked me over the head
and dragged me out of the house,

57
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,990
probably through the back yard.

58
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,577
All I want is for you to look for a shoe.
It's missing.

59
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,413
I'm telling you,
Dexter is not who you think he is.

60
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,874
Do I have the pleasure
of your company this weekend?

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,376
We've had a major break
in the Ice-Truck Killer case.

62
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,128
Debra Morgan...

63
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,088
will you marry me?

64
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,381
Yes. Yes.

65
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,507
Where's my sister?

66
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,801
Took her code 12.
Left about an hour ago.

67
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,928
How did you not know who I was?

68
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,765
I think a real cop
would...at least have a sense

69
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:07,853
that she was in the presence
of the person that she was hunting.

70
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,106
Where the fuck are you?
I'm here at work.

71
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,484
I need to talk to you.
Do not see Rudy until you find me.

72
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,903
You're connected to this.

73
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,281
I don't know how, but I'll find out, and some of
what I find's gonna stick to your ass.

74
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,617
I was hoping you could dig up
an old case file for me.

75
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,868
Sure thing.

76
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,621
It's the crime scene where Harry found me.

77
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,081
This is what he wanted me to find all along.

78
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,583
He's showing me where to go.

79
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,377
Laura Moser and three others
found chopped up with a chainsaw.

80
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,131
What is in that report that
Harry didn't want me to see?

81
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,508
What he saw in that
cargo container changed him.

82
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,803
You were left there for days, starving,

83
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,847
In blood two inches thick.

84
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,099
You remember now?

85
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,311
- I have a brother.
- A real brother.

86
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,480
I didn't even know you existed.

87
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:55,234
Imagine how I felt
when I tracked you down

88
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,819
and found out you were exactly like me.

89
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,239
You can't be a killer and a hero.

90
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,908
It doesn't work that way!

91
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,666
Why me, Dex? Why'd he choose me?

92
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,251
Just lucky, I guess.

93
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,173
I was so scared. I was so scared.

94
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,675
Am I one of your victims now?

95
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,052
You're not a trophy.

96
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,137
But you need to be put down.

97
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,932
Sorry.

98
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,434
I drove away a brother who accepts me

99
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,853
for a foster father who betrayed me.

100
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,189
I'm not alone, and Harry kept it from me.

101
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,858
Doakes always sensed
I was hiding something.

102
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,695
Now he knows.
My devil danced with his demon

103
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,489
and the fiddler's tune is far from over.

104
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,780
Tonight's the night...

105
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,457
..and it's going to happen
again and again.

106
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,544
Has to happen.

107
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:09,010
It's not what I want,
but what I want doesn't matter.

108
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:13,557
This is the only way
I know how to survive.

109
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,814
I'm coiled and ready to strike...

110
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,573
...although a spare will do.

111
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,950
Nice. Nice. Nice warm-up, bro.

112
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:35,203
Now, you can get that.
Remember, loose-arm swing.

113
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,538
Loose. Got it.

114
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,956
And keep your mind limber.

115
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,667
- I'm doing mental jumping jacks.
- Don't forget.

116
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,836
Okey dokey.

117
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,671
I'm on edge.

118
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,383
38 days, 16 hours,
and 12 minutes have passed

119
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,260
since I killed my brother.

120
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:55,182
In that entire time, I haven't
had a single night to myself.

121
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,685
Sergeant Doakes makes sure of that.
He follows me everywhere now,

122
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,689
a human bloodhound,
incited by the scent of darkness.

123
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:08,403
My best hope of losing him
is to act relentlessly normal, dull.

124
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,280
So I bowl.

125
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,663
What's really disturbing
is that I'm good at it.

126
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,582
Balls, Dex.

127
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,751
You pictured it, didn't you?

128
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,883
Hey, striker, we need you
to lock down tonight, huh?

129
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,677
We're playing the Alley Cats.

130
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,514
I'm a little tense, Angel.

131
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,017
But I'll try my best
not to let the team down.

132
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,311
Try? Try?

133
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,188
You got to think positive, bro,

134
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,398
'cause what we think
creates the world around us.

135
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,193
It's all about energy
and interconnectedness.

136
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,861
I mean, we got to think positive...

137
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,031
Angel lost someone, too,
when his wife left him.

138
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:56,451
Now he's going toward the light,
searching for answers.

139
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,954
He found one on an Oprah rerun.

140
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,456
I wish it were that easy for me.

141
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,793
And we just got to direct it
to manifest what we want.

142
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,169
OK?

143
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,505
All right.

144
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,354
Dude, dude, just bowl a strike

145
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,439
so we can go have some fun
at the strip clubs.

146
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,483
I want to see a real 7-10 split.

147
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,402
I wish I could have fun.

148
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,780
With Doakes tailing me,
my life's been all Jekyll and no Hyde -

149
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,156
no moonlit play dates,

150
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,993
no late-night social calls, not one.

151
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,704
My brother would be so disappointed.

152
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,124
Don't forget,
tell the universe what you need.

153
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,417
I really need

154
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,252
to kill somebody.

155
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,184
Did you even take my advice?

156
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,979
I'm telling you, the universe
can be very generous.

157
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,160
It certainly can.

158
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:28,001
For weeks I've known who was next,
who belonged to me.

159
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,046
I just needed Doakes to take a night off.

160
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,517
What do you need?

161
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,731
I need to curse someone.

162
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,233
What kind of curse?

163
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,155
Death curse.

164
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,036
We don't do that kind of thing here.

165
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,121
You can go down to Little Haiti,

166
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,707
find all the hoodoo voodoo
you need there.

167
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:13,254
You are Jimmy Sensio,
high priest, right?

168
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,679
The man with God in his mouth?

169
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,099
I'm not a tourist.

170
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,560
I need a Petro curse,
and I heard you were the best.

171
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,148
Thank you for your offering.

172
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,733
Come.

173
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,214
A blind man -
not very sporting, I know,

174
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,594
but I'm not one to discriminate
based on race, gender, or disability.

175
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,728
What...is...happening?

176
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,815
The only pertinent question is
what happened to your victims?

177
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,818
What are you doing?
What do you want?

178
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,864
I can see this might be confusing, Jimmy,
but my favorite part's kind of ruined here.

179
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,868
See, this is where I'd normally show you
the innocent people you've killed.

180
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,204
I brought them along anyway,
as part of my death ritual.

181
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,040
Since you're blind,
I'll just remind you.

182
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,710
Emmanuel Alzua,

183
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,462
Jean Philippe Peguero,

184
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,464
Nono Baptiste.

185
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,090
I didn't kill them.

186
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,009
I cursed them.

187
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,719
And in a remarkable coincidence,

188
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,679
they each died of respiratory failure

189
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,681
with fluid in their lungs.

190
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,309
I guess murder is one way
to make your curses come true.

191
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,560
It's good for business.

192
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,647
What...what was that?

193
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,983
Just the next part of the ritual.

194
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,155
How did you administer
the ricin poison to your victims?

195
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,164
I am the one
with the power in his hands.

196
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,459
That's not entirely accurate.

197
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,795
Those who believe in me shall be free.

198
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,963
Alabanza, Alaban...

199
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,173
Knock it off.

200
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,551
How'd you poison them?

201
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,887
Not me.

202
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,015
Madoli, my Petro spirit,

203
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,476
told me put the powder

204
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,854
In the aguardiente bottles
that they buy from me.

205
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,774
And I did it.

206
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,234
Thank you, Jimmy.

207
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,402
My ritual's almost complete.

208
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,988
Madoli curses you! You...

209
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,117
I'm afraid Madoli's a little
late to the party on that one.

210
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:56,501
I appreciate you helping
me out tonight, Jimmy.

211
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,212
I've been waiting a long time for this.

212
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,548
I really needed it.

213
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,569
What the fuck?

214
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,547
Let that be a lesson to you.

215
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,924
I've always enjoyed my work.

216
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,220
It brings order to the chaos,
fills me with civic pride.

217
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,222
But what was that back there?

218
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,807
Not voodoo.

219
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:56,436
When I picked up the knife,
it's like I didn't know who I was.

220
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,646
I come here to dump bodies,
not beer bottles.

221
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,815
Now I'm just a litterbug.

222
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,546
Deb!

223
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,012
Jesus!

224
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,057
What are you doing working out
in the middle of the night?

225
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,183
I couldn't sleep.

226
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,644
Tomorrow's your big day.

227
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,523
Where the fuck were you?
I was worried about you.

228
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,858
Bowling.

229
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,777
Kind of late for bowling.

230
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,779
Kind of not looking for your opinion.

231
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,574
You said you cleaned the place today?

232
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,660
I did. It got messed up again.

233
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,871
I don't suppose you were looking at
apartment ads on the treadmill?

234
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,332
- Look, if you want me out of here, just...
- I don't.

235
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,584
I just had a bad...

236
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,795
...bowling night.

237
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,547
I meant, when you're ready
to be on your own,

238
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,133
I'll help you with the transition, that's all.

239
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,762
Thanks, Dex.

240
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,889
Thanks for putting up with me.

241
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,558
You're all I got.

242
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,854
That's not such a great bargain
for you, huh?

243
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,191
I'm not complaining.

244
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,987
Night.

245
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,655
It's your turn on the couch.

246
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,782
Could you at least pick up your...

247
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,911
Debra can't sleep
in an empty house any more.

248
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,913
In fact, she can't sleep much at all.

249
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,083
I guess that's what happens
when your fianc? tries to slice you up

250
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,627
into small, bloodless pieces.

251
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,882
Pathetic.

252
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,562
- Did you see that?
- Nice shooting, Dex. We need to talk.

253
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,231
Those boars don't stand a chance.
Hope one charges me.

254
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,608
- No, you don't.
- Got massive stopping power....

255
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,610
Dexter, slow down.
I got bad news.

256
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,655
They need me to take a shift at work.

257
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,907
Right now?
What about the boar hunt?

258
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,284
We'll plan another trip.

259
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,827
I waited two weeks for this trip.

260
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,954
- You can wait another one.
- No, I can't.

261
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,498
If you read the books,
you'd know psychopaths like me

262
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:26,669
- have a low tolerance for frustration.
- Enough with the psychopath bullshit.

263
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,546
You're in control of your urges.

264
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,549
You don't understand, Dad.
I need this.

265
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,426
It's not just a sport to me.

266
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,471
I'm sorry, son.
I have responsibilities at work.

267
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,889
Now, come on.

268
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,017
- I'll drop you off at home. Give me the gun.
- No!

269
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,116
There's cheese in that doughnut.

270
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,368
Oh, that's a Danish.

271
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,954
Look, they forgot the frosting on this one.

272
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:06,042
Well, some people like doughnuts plain,
no frosting.

273
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:11,839
I can't even get doughnuts right.
What's going on here?

274
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,675
Sorry, guys, I was in a hurry.
I just ordered a dozen.

275
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,179
Pastry buffs like you two
deserve better than this.

276
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,972
Thanks, Dexter.

277
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,975
We're gonna go visit my dad in jail today.

278
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,894
Want to come?

279
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,521
Afraid I got to work, buddy.

280
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,314
OK.

281
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,942
Thanks for getting here so fast.

282
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,360
What's the emergency?

283
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,820
Hip Hop Harry is on.

284
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,877
We're good for 15 minutes.

285
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,883
I know we're supposed
to have dinner tonight,

286
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,094
but I just had this urge.

287
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,182
I'm all for satisfying urges.

288
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,644
I just wish I knew
why I couldn't satisfy mine last night.

289
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,537
Is everything OK?

290
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,874
- Yeah, it will be. Just keep going.
- OK.

291
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,961
Any minute now...

292
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,807
Sorry.

293
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,101
No. No, it's my fault.

294
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,770
I shouldn't be springing this on you.

295
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,939
No, it's...not that.

296
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,275
I'm just feeling a...

297
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,111
a little pressure at work.

298
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,285
I'll be OK.

299
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,620
I followed the code.

300
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,496
The stalk was good.

301
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,750
I'm just a little rusty
since killing my brother.

302
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,754
Or maybe I took pity on my victim.

303
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,925
I mean, sure, he's a heinous killer,
but he also bumps into walls.

304
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,933
Hey, Sergeant.

305
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,976
Thanks for supporting
the bowling team.

306
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,019
Fuck you.

307
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:33,064
Where's my blood report
on the Maynard victim?

308
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,527
So, what's that, a titty site?

309
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,821
Oops, caught me.

310
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,200
Bullshit. What the hell
were you really doing in here?

311
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,702
The tits are right there.

312
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,621
Yeah, but in ten years,

313
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,415
you've never rented a single porn title.

314
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,128
Huh. How would you know?

315
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,507
Call me an office crazy,

316
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,842
but your humbling interest
in my personal life

317
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,971
could be misinterpreted
as harassment in some circles.

318
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,556
So report me.

319
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,184
I could think of easier solutions.

320
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,146
Nice tits.

321
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,697
James, you got any
misdemeanor A forms?

322
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,907
Try the filing cabinet.

323
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,164
Can anybody tell me where the goddamn
misdemeanor A forms are kept?

324
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,834
I've got some right here, Lieutenant.

325
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,879
OK, all right, move along.
Nothing to see here.

326
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,132
Just another fucking day at work.

327
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,265
Welcome back...Morgan.

328
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,350
Thanks.

329
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,439
Maria.

330
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,407
A tour-boat guide called in
a body at the breakwater.

331
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,743
I want you to take Doakes
and a support team

332
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,369
and take Morgan.

333
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,580
I want to get her back out
in the field today.

334
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,417
She's not ready.
She shouldn't even be here.

335
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,085
What's it been?
Five weeks, six?

336
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:21,422
I appreciate your concern
but according to her psych evaluation,

337
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,258
she's ready to get back out into the field.

338
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,262
You just got to look her in the eyes
to know she's not right.

339
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:31,390
You put her out in the field,
she could melt down, freak out.

340
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,935
She hugged me.

341
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,814
All right, you partner with her today
so you can keep an eye on her.

342
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,566
- That's...
- Not a request.

343
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,068
Put Doakes with Batista.

344
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,574
Fine.

345
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,035
Maria...

346
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,746
I know it's difficult
for you to take orders

347
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,915
when you feel that
you should be giving them,

348
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,334
and I really appreciate
your professionalism.

349
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,003
Thanks. Thank you.

350
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,800
You don't like roses?

351
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,052
Allergies.

352
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,388
And let me know what you
find out about that body.

353
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,892
OK, guys, listen up.

354
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,193
Heard your sister's back
on the job already.

355
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,945
Is she in any kind of shape?

356
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,905
Oh, you know Deb.
Nothing gets her down.

357
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,615
No, I mean, did she pack on any pounds?

358
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,826
'Cause, you know,
last time I saw her, she was tight.

359
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,791
We got multiple chop wounds,
pretty much head to toe.

360
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,336
All right, you call it -
heads or tails.

361
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,839
- Heads.
- Hey, I didn't flip yet.

362
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,340
You said call it.

363
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,634
Damn. I always get the ass end.

364
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,095
There you go, Sergeant.

365
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,638
Never mind.

366
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,185
I got sharp-force trauma here,

367
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,020
heavy-impact, parallel wounds.

368
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,564
Maybe an axe.

369
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,567
No, the defense wounds
on the forearms are long and linear,

370
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,777
and I can make out beveled margins.

371
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,571
A machete did this.

372
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,574
The machete is the weapon
of choice of the 29th Street Kings.

373
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,201
The victim was in the gang,
judging from that tattoo.

374
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:17,496
We think the body was carried
from a nearby location.

375
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,833
I found a real good blood trail
coming down from the road.

376
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,168
Damn it.

377
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,213
Lens.

378
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,385
Let's make sure we check
the dock slips for criminal records.

379
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:35,181
It's possible this victim was killed
by one of these boat owners out here.

380
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,184
Or maybe it was just an easy access spot
to dump a corpse at night.

381
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,477
There are no light poles.

382
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,271
The freeway exit ramp's just a block away.

383
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,023
He's got a point.

384
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,235
Yo, Dex.

385
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,033
You're supposed to preserve
the crime scene, asshole.

386
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,788
What's the matter with you today?

387
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,876
I'm just a little off my game.
I'll get it back.

388
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,296
- What time did you find the body?
- Seven o'clock.

389
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,090
I start prepping the banana boat
every morning at seven

390
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,926
for our Miami Banana tour.

391
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,427
- Banana tour?
- Yeah, yeah.

392
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,096
It's a calypso journey
through Miami's inner harbor,

393
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,599
- and you should try it.
- I'll think about it.

394
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,310
Hey, isn't that
the Ice-Truck Killer's babe?

395
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,604
She was in the paper.
She's fucking hot.

396
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,481
Did you see anyone else this morning?

397
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,899
No, not this morning.

398
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,319
Are you sure?

399
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,196
Yeah. I'd have given them a brochure.

400
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,948
Yo, Mrs. Ice-Truck Killer!

401
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,367
OK. Hang on. Hang on.

402
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,786
Just turn around.
Look scared for the camera.

403
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,206
If you think of anything else,
you have our numbers.

404
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,583
And you have mine.
Can I pass these out now?

405
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,044
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

406
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,173
Come on. Just look over here.

407
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,717
Look scared for the camera.

408
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,263
Morgan...

409
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,975
Thank you.

410
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,770
What? Do you need help with something?

411
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,942
Rafael!

412
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,361
- Where is Rafael?
- Shit. Sergeant!

413
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,490
Don't just stand there!
Grab her! What are you doing?

414
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,326
- Somebody stop her! Miss!
- Rafael!

415
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:22,329
- Miss, you cannot go down there.
- Hey! Hey!

416
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,581
Batista, stop her!

417
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,958
God damn it, Morgan, grab her!

418
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,487
Can we please secure this
motherfucking crime scene?

419
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,997
What did she say?

420
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,208
That's her son.

421
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,169
She says she knows who killed him -

422
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,588
some guy named Little Chino.

423
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,384
- It felt like she was asking me something.
- She was.

424
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,346
She wants you to find Little Chino
and kill him like a dog.

425
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,485
That look.

426
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,654
I know that look.

427
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,407
Like her mother, she wants
someone to do something.

428
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,293
The next stop on Matchy
the Matchbook's magical journey

429
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,004
down the rainbow path is...

430
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,758
...the dreaded chocolate swamp.

431
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,259
Why is it dreaded?

432
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,095
I love chocolate.

433
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,098
Because...the chocolate swamp

434
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,227
is the home of a goopy, gooey
nightmare named Gloppy,

435
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,397
who turns children into Fudgesicles
and eats them!

436
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,149
What does Matchy do?

437
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:19,697
Well, luckily, Gloppy was sleeping,

438
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,741
so Matchy goes straight
to Candy Castle,

439
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,327
where he becomes King Candy,

440
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,204
who can turn everyone into sweets

441
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,040
with a wave of his royal gumball staff.

442
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,583
Cool story, Dad.

443
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,336
But next time,
can we play the actual game?

444
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,256
First chance I get, I'll talk to the warden

445
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,718
about finding some of
those missing game pieces, OK?

446
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,596
OK. Got to go, kids.

447
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,476
All right, say goodbye to your father.

448
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,937
Jump! Jump!

449
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,691
Hugs!

450
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,485
What's wrong with your lip?

451
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,655
Well, I was biting it
cause I was excited to see you.

452
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:05,284
So come back real soon, OK?
OK, buddy. Bye.

453
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,621
Rita, one minute?

454
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,625
All right. Go wait by the door.

455
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,796
I need your help. My lawyer
is gonna file my appeal tomorrow,

456
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,965
but I don't stand a chance
without that shoe.

457
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,510
There's no shoe. How many times
do I have to tell you that?

458
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,971
OK... Anything, any evidence

459
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,765
to support the fact that I was set up.

460
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,308
You mean that Dexter set you up.

461
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,518
Somebody set me up.

462
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:36,190
Rita, I'm not doing real good
in here, OK?

463
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,776
It's a federal prison, hardcore.

464
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,986
I don't belong here.

465
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,154
Will you help me?

466
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,993
I need to go.
I'll see you in a couple of weeks.

467
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:01,048
Angel, will you please
take Eva's statement

468
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,926
and set up her daughter, Marissa,
with some crayons, OK?

469
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,804
Sure thing.

470
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,568
That girl's gonna need
more than crayons

471
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,446
to make her world right.

472
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,700
Killing Little Chino
could restore my world, too,

473
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,537
but only if he satisfies Harry's code.

474
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,416
I see you've been benched.

475
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,920
LaGuerta's just jealous the Ice-Truck Killer
fucked me instead of her.

476
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,756
Wow.

477
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:43,924
You're chipper.

478
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,717
Just happy to be back on the job.

479
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,638
What do you want?

480
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,182
Just working up my blood report
from the crime scene,

481
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:55,269
wanted to know what you found
on the suspect, Little Chino.

482
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,354
Cocksucker's guilty as they come.

483
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,481
He's an enforcer
for the 29th Street Kings,

484
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,692
East Side gang, intensely violent.

485
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:05,112
He's been linked to nine murders
in the last five years.

486
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,363
So far, so good.

487
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,615
I just hope he's not blind.

488
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,950
Has he ever been tried?

489
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:13,453
Twice, but the witnesses
in each case were murdered,

490
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,746
We think by Chino himself.

491
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,457
Now people are just too afraid
to come forward.

492
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,668
Come on, Chino, right this way.

493
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:40,188
Fucking beef bus.

494
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,364
Dad!

495
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,868
I'm OK, Dex. I've told you...

496
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:56,246
never put your finger on the trigger
unless you're shooting.

497
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,749
- Are you OK?
- Jesus. That was close.

498
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,501
My heart's beating out of my chest.

499
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,921
Let me feel.

500
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:07,215
- Feel what?
- Your heart.

501
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,388
That's amazing.

502
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:20,395
A challenge, a mountain to climb.

503
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,064
I need this one.

504
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,817
Little Chino came to mi front door.

505
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,153
He asked for mi son, Rafael.

506
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:32,866
Rafael did not want to go
with Little Chino,

507
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,202
but he was afraid not to.

508
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:40,207
- What was he going to do?
- My brother has a house in Georgia.

509
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,459
Rafael was going to live with him.

510
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,253
That's why they kill him.

511
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,630
I know it.

512
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,925
Nobody ever leaves the gang.

513
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,510
Eva. Eva.

514
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,221
Eva.

515
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,598
Are you willing to testify

516
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,643
that Little Chino picked up your son
on the night of his death?

517
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,356
Come on. Don't back down now.

518
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,780
I want him to pay.

519
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,407
Got him.

520
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:18,370
Well, that's discouraging.
With a grieving mother as a witness,

521
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:22,040
Little Chino will never reach
my cutting courtroom.

522
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,465
Hey, Morgan, you want to see
something swell?

523
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,384
Come a little closer.

524
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,762
And the token has spoken.
Good to see you, too, Vince.

525
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,306
I heard we captured Bigfoot.

526
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:42,144
Behold the eighth wonder of the world.

527
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,937
Am I speaking clearly?

528
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:54,239
- Yeah.
- Then answer my fucking question, Chino.

529
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,826
What time did you pick up Rafael last night?

530
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:01,246
Last night?
I didn't see Rafael last night.

531
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,917
OK, so why would Rafael's mother
make up that story, Chino?

532
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:11,298
That puta's into the devil's candy, man -
fucking heroin. Shit.

533
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,550
She was probably high.

534
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,970
You're telling me
that Eva Arenas is a junkie?

535
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:20,390
Man, if that's true, Pascal and LaGuerta
are gonna have a piss party.

536
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,937
Eva Arenas,
two pops for drug possession.

537
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,981
No fucking way the DA
puts a drug user on the stand.

538
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,400
That cholo's gonna walk again.

539
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,944
But not very far.

540
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,995
We'll both be vindicated soon.

541
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,196
OK, boys, today's our day.

542
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,449
Let's find that galleon
and bring back the gold.

543
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,913
Here's that aberration
in the sea floor.

544
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,415
The crevice is at 65 feet.

545
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,168
It has to be where
the Santa Rosa went down.

546
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,810
The crevice is 30 to 40 yards
straight ahead.

547
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:16,965
The crevice should be
25 yards ahead, bearing 1-4-4.

548
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,426
I need your help.

549
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,511
I know you were looking
forward to going out

550
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,222
but I think Deb could use you more.

551
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,433
Now, Dexter, this isn't
about this morning, is it?

552
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,478
No, no, I swear. This is for Deb.

553
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:15,023
She had her first day at work today
and LaGuerta was kind of rough on her.

554
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,150
Dexter, unlock the door.

555
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,402
Hold on. Hold on!

556
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,988
Dexter, come on!

557
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,241
Open the fucking door!

558
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,284
See, she's yelling at me now.

559
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,535
Look, I'm no expert,

560
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,330
but I think Deb could use
some girl time tonight.

561
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,207
Well, I won't lie.

562
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,583
I'm a little disappointed,

563
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,669
but I know your heart's
in the right place.

564
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,254
Absolutely.

565
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,048
OK. Whatever you need, Dexter.

566
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,509
Thank you, Rita.
I will make this up to you.

567
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,553
I'm gonna have Deb pick you up
in a half-hour, OK? Bye.

568
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,850
Sorry.

569
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,020
I double-booked when I made plans
to go out with Rita tonight.

570
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:57,190
I forgot that I had promised
to sub for another bowling team.

571
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,859
Why do you look so happy about it?

572
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,029
I like bowling. What can I say?
Look, will you take Rita out for me?

573
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,614
She hired a baby-sitter and everything.

574
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,116
No way. I need to work out.

575
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,202
Actually, you need to stop working out.
It's getting unhealthy.

576
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,329
Why not go out
for some hard liquor instead?

577
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,499
- Sorry, bro.
- Deb, please!

578
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,504
When do I ever ask you for anything?

579
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,510
You bunghole.
Why'd you have to put it that way?

580
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,972
She's expecting you in a half an hour.
You're a life saver.

581
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,857
Tonight's the night.

582
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,442
Really.

583
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:46,823
Harry would prefer I take more time
but my life is falling apart.

584
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,995
Whatever stopped my knife before
won't stop it again.

585
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,788
Hey, there!

586
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,417
Gonna work
on my release tonight -

587
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,878
practice, practice, practice.

588
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,007
Lane's open till midnight.
You want to join me?

589
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,434
Fuck it.

590
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,763
There is nothing else to talk about.

591
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,932
You are a liar, and you lied!

592
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,350
Would you stop

593
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,185
- trying to act all hard like that?
- Shit.

594
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,313
You want me to act better,
then you treat me better.

595
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,066
You got these things
all mixed up in your head.

596
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,818
Listen to me. I love you, Boo.

597
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,987
It's all about you. There is nobody else!

598
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,324
Is that why you bought me
three dozen fucking roses?

599
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,451
Get out of my sight.

600
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,662
I send you flowers, babe,

601
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,705
- because I love you.
- Get out of my sight.

602
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,708
I got nothing else to say to you
until you decide to man up.

603
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,462
Please, go.

604
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,889
Maria?

605
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,683
Fuck.

606
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,402
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

607
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,070
That was my fianc?.

608
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,657
We are having some problems.

609
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,952
Well, that happens.

610
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,089
I called his house three nights in a row
and he says he's working.

611
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,216
He didn't return my phone calls.

612
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,510
And then he comes home,
and he says he's tired.

613
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:17,515
Well, he's tired because
he's out there fucking some bitch.

614
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,477
I can smell it on him.

615
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,898
Don't worry about washing their hair.

616
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:28,276
- And read to them before bed.
- OK, got it.

617
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,278
Hello?

618
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,239
You have a collect call from Paul Bennett.
Will you accept the charges?

619
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,658
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

620
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,621
Excuse me.

621
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,373
Rita, do you have a second?
I need to talk to you.

622
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,000
What do you want?

623
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,960
I'm not gonna make it in here.

624
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,254
I don't have time
for your bullshit right now.

625
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,881
It's not bullshit.

626
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,634
I'm not like these guys.
I don't belong here, Rita.

627
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,010
Can you help me?

628
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,137
Help you? What?

629
00:41:56,263 --> 00:42:00,058
Just, can you look
for the shoe one more time?

630
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,728
I found the fucking shoe, OK?

631
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,397
You...you what?

632
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,942
Oh, that's great!
I'll call the lawyer in the morning!

633
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,319
Look, what does it matter?
It's just a shoe.

634
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,695
It doesn't mean anything.

635
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,532
You were probably high on smack
when you lost it at my house.

636
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,243
Whatever.
I'll let the courts fucking decide that.

637
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,828
- This is good news.
- No! No, Paul, no.

638
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,540
If you send a lawyer to my house,
the shoe won't be here.

639
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,667
I'm not gonna let you
drag Dexter into this.

640
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,044
I'm in a healthy relationship, finally,

641
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,172
and I'm not gonna throw it away
to bail out my abusive ex-husband.

642
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,549
It doesn't work that way.

643
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,300
I got to go.

644
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,720
No, you don't. No, don't...
Rita, don't hang up that fucking phone.

645
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:40,181
Stop blaming other people
for your problems.

646
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:43,434
- You're in prison now, Paul. Deal with it.
- Rita!

647
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,481
No! No! No! No!

648
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,783
Some gangs earn
teardrops of blood by killing.

649
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,494
I understand.
We all need our keepsakes.

650
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,998
One man's tattoos
are another man's blood slides.

651
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,083
All I had to do was call
the gang task force,

652
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,752
ask where the 29th Street Kings
get their tattoos,

653
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,171
and wait for my prey to show up.

654
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,431
What the fuck?

655
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,435
What the fuck? Get the fuck off me!

656
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,730
Fuck! Get the fuck off!

657
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,982
Fuck that shit!

658
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,540
The scene of the failed crime -

659
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,500
no better place to try again.

660
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,712
I have it on good authority
the owner fled town.

661
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:56,341
Plus, it's a much quieter working
environment now without the chickens.

662
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,568
So...

663
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,946
You and Dexter come here a lot?

664
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,366
We love the hot wings.

665
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,789
Look, I'm sorry
if I'm such bad company tonight.

666
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,083
Paul called right before we left.

667
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,918
Yeah? What did he want?

668
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,461
Well, who knows?

669
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,922
Make me feel bad he's in prison, I suppose.

670
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,423
Hey, I'm the one that answered

671
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,385
that domestic-dispute call
way back when, remember?

672
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,595
That prick deserves to be in prison.

673
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,305
I know. I know.

674
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,432
I know. I just...

675
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,518
I can't believe I still let him get to me

676
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,396
after everything he's put me through.

677
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,110
Oh, God, I'm such an idiot.

678
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,613
What you went through
is so much worse than my problems.

679
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,407
What?

680
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,242
My psycho killer fianc??

681
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,536
Please. I've had worse.

682
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,788
At least he paid for my meals.

683
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,834
I can't believe you moved on like that.

684
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,461
I wish I could be more like you.

685
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,715
Paul was so horrible to me...

686
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,718
Really horrible.

687
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,804
Sometimes... Don't tell Dexter,

688
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,015
but...sometimes...

689
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:31,894
I find myself missing
the good parts of him.

690
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,690
Oh, God.

691
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,236
Not him.

692
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,614
Not him, it's not him that you miss.

693
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:48,661
'Cause what he had to offer wasn't real.

694
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,792
But the way he made you feel
about yourself...

695
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,173
that was real.

696
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,885
Hey, are you OK?

697
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,094
Need a refill?

698
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,852
Can I get another draught, please?

699
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,229
Hey, excuse me.

700
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,356
Don't I know you from somewhere?

701
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,903
Haven't I seen you on television?

702
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,323
Oh...yeah.

703
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,659
Hey, excuse me, are you that girl...

704
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,578
What the fuck are you doing?

705
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:34,540
- Debra, what happened?
- He grabbed me! You saw it, right?

706
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,834
- He grabbed me.
- I think you broke my fucking nose.

707
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,295
- You fucking grabbed me!
- All I did was touch you.

708
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,839
You saw it. He grabbed me.

709
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,350
He wasn't easy to get here,

710
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,645
but here he is, and here I am -

711
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:58,231
ready, willing...

712
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,984
Able?

713
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:10,243
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

714
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,410
Shit.

715
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,749
Not enough tape. Perfect.

716
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,233
39 days, 22 hours, and 18 minutes

717
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,819
since I killed my brother.

718
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,029
I am cursed.

719
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:20,521
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

720
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,939
- What were you doing?
- I don't know.

721
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,608
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know.

722
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,527
Whatever you're going through,
killing yourself isn't the answer.

723
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,905
You don't get points for dying.

724
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,489
Dying?

725
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,825
Dad, I...I don't want to die.

726
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:36,495
I'm just trying to figure out
some way to feel alive.

727
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:44,503
I don't normally seek human
contact in times of failure,

728
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,757
but then I don't normally
experience failure.

729
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:54,221
Right now all I can think about
is the smell of Rita's kitchen,

730
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:58,351
the breathy cadence
of her sleeping children,

731
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,561
the warmth of her flesh.

732
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,461
Rita?

733
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,254
What's wrong?

734
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,925
The prison called.

735
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,927
Paul's dead.

736
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:46,565
He died in an inmate altercation.

737
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,485
It was a fight.

738
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:52,822
He was angry, and he got into a fight.

739
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,952
Now I have to figure out how
to tell my children their father's dead.

740
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,917
And I could have helped him.

741
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,171
How?

742
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:15,720
Rita, how could you have helped him?
He was in prison.

743
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:21,475
That's right, Dexter. It happened in prison.

744
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,936
Paul was in prison.

745
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,691
That was his own fault.

746
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:34,989
Was it?

747
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,319
You all right? Rita said you got in a brawl.

748
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,987
You've got to see this.

749
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,865
Mount Pleasant and 81...

750
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:21,118
They've been playing it
on the news all night.

751
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,374
Two treasure hunters made
a ghastly discovery today

752
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,044
when they stumbled on what appears
to be an underwater graveyard

753
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,047
in a crevice off the coast of Miami.

754
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,715
There's bodies in those bags.

755
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:39,220
The butchered bodies were submerged
inside these heavy-duty garbage bags.

756
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,389
Authorities have located
at least 30 bags so far,

757
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,726
but around-the-clock salvage efforts
are still under way.

758
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:48,187
Did you hear that? 30 bags.

759
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,231
Do you know what that means?

760
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,233
There might be
a new mass murderer out there,

761
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:55,027
way worse than the Ice-Truck Killer.

762
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,655
Maybe I can finally get some peace.

763
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,449
Isn't that great?
