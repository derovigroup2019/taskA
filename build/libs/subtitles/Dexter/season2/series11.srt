1
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,190
Previously on "Dexter"...

2
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,460
Jesus fucking christ. you're
the bay harbor butcher.

3
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,990
I really hate that name.

4
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,860
What's it gonna be, morgan?!

5
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,620
Kill me now or set me free!

6
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,060
James knows that I believe in
him, so it was worth the risk.

7
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,090
To your job? to your career?

8
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,860
When you care about someone,
you do what you have to do.

9
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,460
And your credibility was compromised

10
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,320
The second you failed
to report a phone call

11
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,520
From the subject of
a goddamn fbi manhunt.

12
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,820
What really pisses me
off is you might be right.

13
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,520
The kids have been
through so much lately.

14
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,890
I don't want them to feel

15
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,590
Like they've been abandoned
by everyone they love.

16
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,860
Does this mean we're dating again?

17
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,560
I track killers. that's what I do.

18
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,890
They tend to move around.

19
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,360
I know that.

20
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,790
Then I'm not sure

21
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,320
What you thought would
happen when the case ended.

22
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,220
I like it rough.

23
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,120
Yeah?

24
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,790
Jesus.

25
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,290
I don't need doakes dead.

26
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,790
I just need his fingerprints
to complete my frame job.

27
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,960
Every saturday, beginning dive classes

28
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,790
Practice underwater
skills beside this dock.

29
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,690
Tomorrow they'll find a
morbid little surprise.

30
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,290
I want to know if there
was anything unusual

31
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,720
About my father's death.

32
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,790
He killed himself, dexter.

33
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,790
The idea of a code was one
thing, but the reality of it?

34
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,960
Hey, dad.

35
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,420
Harry walked in on what he created...

36
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,860
And he couldn't live with himself.

37
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,220
I always thought hardening arteries

38
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,290
Squeezed the life out of my father,

39
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,290
But it was me.

40
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,860
Harry gazed into the eyes
of his creation and saw evil,

41
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,790
Pure and simple.

42
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,360
My evil -
it killed him.

43
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,290
That shit about
your father -

44
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,620
If you want to talk about it...

45
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,820
About what?

46
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,120
That my life is one tragic mistake?

47
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,160
We've all felt that at one
time or another. I know I have.

48
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,690
Did you happen to be stuffing
a human leg into a garbage bag

49
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,990
At that point?

50
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,390
If you want to make a change,
morgan, now's the time.

51
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,190
All you got to do is let me out of here.

52
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,890
It's over, man.

53
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,990
It is over when I say it is!

54
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,890
There's that anger again.

55
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,020
You got to let that out, man.

56
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,590
Careful, sergeant, you
might get your wish.

57
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,560
I'm flying without a code here.

58
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,120
I can unleash the beast anytime I want.

59
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,190
Morgan, you know that's not the answer.

60
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,790
But it would feel fucking great.

61
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,060
But you would hate yourself
for the rest of your life.

62
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,220
All the things harry
taught me, everything -

63
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,260
It's bullshit.

64
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,660
It's the only way I know how to live.

65
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,360
Turn yourself in.

66
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,360
Rule number
one -

67
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,260
Don't get caught.

68
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,760
No, no, morgan, you're spinning.

69
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,160
Let me help you.

70
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,420
It's only a matter of time
before you hurt someone else.

71
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,720
And I'm not
talking about me -

72
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,720
I'm talking about your
sister or your girlfriend

73
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,560
Or even those kids.

74
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,820
I would
never -

75
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,760
No, not on purpose, but
you can't control that shit

76
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,220
That's growing inside of you, morgan.

77
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,420
It's like cancer.

78
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,320
And in case you haven't
noticed, it's spreading.

79
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,060
End it now.

80
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:51,560
Take responsibility
for who you are, man.

81
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,190
We'll go to the station together.

82
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,720
I'll help you.

83
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,990
Morgan.

84
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,120
Morgan, don't answer that.

85
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,590
Stay with me, man.

86
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,590
Morgan!

87
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,260
Fuck!

88
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,920
Yes, this is dexter morgan.

89
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,820
Mr. morgan, my name is dr. hill.

90
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,790
I work at good samaritan hospital.

91
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,460
I'm calling on behalf of lila tournay.

92
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,920
How did you get this number?

93
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,690
You're listed as her emergency contact.

94
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,090
Ms. tournay was rushed into our e. r.

95
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,190
In respiratory arrest.

96
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,820
Could you come to the hospital?

97
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,860
I'm two hours away. call somebody else.

98
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,260
Mr. morgan, there's
a legal complication.

99
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,520
What kind of complication?

100
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,660
I can't discuss it over the phone.

101
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,160
You really need to be here.

102
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,760
Where are you going, morgan?

103
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,920
Don't worry, I'll send the
fbi your way soon enough.

104
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,020
You're still gonna try to frame me?

105
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,090
I'm kind of down a path here.

106
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,460
You'll get your chance to
tell them I'm the killer,

107
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,160
And they'll ignore you
like before, and I'll -

108
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,560
And you'll burn in hell.

109
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,490
Something like that.

110
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,390
Morgan!

111
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,920
He's gone, dex.

112
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,120
Dad's heart finally gave out.

113
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,160
Harry's heart gave out when
he saw what's inside me.

114
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,660
He thought he could tame
it, give it a purpose,

115
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,920
Help it find a place
in the natural order.

116
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,160
Guess he was wrong.

117
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,620
Dexter?

118
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,320
Mr. morgan? yeah.

119
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,660
I need a second alone
with him, okay? thanks.

120
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,320
Dr. hill - we
spoke on the phone

121
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,260
Regarding your girlfriend, ms. tournay.

122
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,090
She's not my girlfriend.

123
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,290
Oh, I thought she said she was.

124
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,290
Yeah, she probably did.

125
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
So, you're...

126
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,620
It's complicated.

127
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,620
Look, why is angel here?

128
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,890
We found rohypnol, the date-rape drug,

129
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,190
In lila's system.

130
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,260
With her bruising, the wound
to the back of her head -

131
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,060
We may be looking at a
case of sexual assault.

132
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,890
No, no, that didn't happen.

133
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,020
Ms. tournay has no
recollection of what did happen.

134
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,460
She's requested we perform a rape kit.

135
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,890
I need to talk to her.

136
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,560
Dexter, you came to see me.

137
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,590
You're so sweet.

138
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,560
The doctors think angel raped you.

139
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,920
Did he? everything's a bit fuzzy.

140
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,920
This is desperate.

141
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,460
It won't work.

142
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,220
What are you talking about?

143
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,920
I'm just glad you're here.

144
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,990
I missed you so much.

145
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,520
This is how you win me back?

146
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,520
Framing a good man to get what you want?

147
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,960
Which is precisely what
I'm doing to doakes.

148
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,260
What's the matter, dexter?

149
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,860
You look so sad... lost.

150
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,490
Don't do this.

151
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,120
I won't press charges against angel.

152
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,660
I'll do whatever you want.

153
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,790
If you promise to take me back.

154
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,860
Why can't you just let me go?

155
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,720
Because I'm your real soul mate.

156
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,790
Not rita.

157
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,990
Me.

158
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,190
I see you.

159
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,420
Inside.

160
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,490
I'm the only one.

161
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,220
Look where it's gotten you.

162
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,260
You know that I could never
do anything like that, right?

163
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,960
You don't even have
to say anything, angel.

164
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,990
You warned me about her,
but my dick wouldn't listen.

165
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,060
I could lose everything over this.

166
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,220
What would I say to my little girl?

167
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,890
The doctor said lila has
72 hours to press charges.

168
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,690
Maybe she'll come to her senses.

169
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,890
I should get home and
grab a few hours of sleep.

170
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,360
Let me get this.

171
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,760
No, back off. I got it.

172
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,160
Oh, angel.

173
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,960
If I got to
choose a person -

174
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:30,260
A real person
- to be like...

175
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,360
Out of anyone, it'd be you.

176
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,160
I'm not really sure what
that means, but, thanks, dex.

177
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,890
See you in the morning.

178
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,220
Oh, and, uh, I'd appreciate it

179
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,990
If you didn't mention this
to anyone at the station.

180
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,820
Of course not.

181
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,890
Thanks.

182
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,790
How did it come to this?

183
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,520
I've always gone after criminals.

184
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,620
Now I have the fate of
two cops in my hands.

185
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,260
Doakes was right.

186
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,420
The cancer is spreading.

187
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,520
We're out of yogurt.

188
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,120
Add it to the list.

189
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,990
We'll stop by the store tonight.

190
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,820
The store's on the way to work.

191
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,390
It's also on the way home.

192
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,590
We're gonna be late.

193
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,090
Hey, who joined who in
the shower this morning?

194
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,520
How about, in the future,

195
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,460
I set the alarm 10 minutes earlier?

196
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,990
Make it 20.

197
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,160
"the future -" I'm
liking the sound of that.

198
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,320
We're being ordered to work.

199
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,120
Fuck that. you're the
head of the task force.

200
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,390
You do the ordering.

201
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,560
Who's d. d. adams?

202
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,620
My boss.

203
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,190
Mission accomplished.

204
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,860
The weapons I tossed into the ocean

205
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,220
Were found as planned.

206
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,360
One more nail in doakes' coffin.

207
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,220
All right, people. listen up.

208
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,560
This is fbi deputy director max adams.

209
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,290
He just got in from washington.

210
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,560
He's going to be helping
us out for a while.

211
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,390
Max.

212
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,090
Frank.

213
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,220
Once again, I have pledged our
full cooperation and resources,

214
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,060
So let's make him feel at home.

215
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,360
Max.

216
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,390
The murder weapons before
you were recovered yesterday

217
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,220
By a beginning scuba-diving class.

218
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,390
The instructor contacted
the fbi directly,

219
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,760
Which brought them to my attention.

220
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,020
Fingerprint analysis ties
them to one james doakes.

221
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,590
This doesn't prove a goddamn thing.

222
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,590
Not now, maria.

223
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,060
Why wasn't I brought in on this?

224
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,320
You just were, frank.

225
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,690
Now, we know sergeant doakes has been...

226
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,560
Lundy better watch his back.

227
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,560
...he's abandoned the
tools of the trade,

228
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,490
That means he's probably on the run.

229
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,220
This footage was taken four
days ago at a mobile station

230
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,790
Just off highway 41,
southeast of naples.

231
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,090
Ladies and gentlemen,
sergeant james doakes.

232
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,360
I can't believe it.

233
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,920
$3.49 for regular?

234
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,860
So, we have let our
target get away once.

235
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,420
Let's not drop the ball again.

236
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,990
Asshole.

237
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,160
Highway 41 runs through the
everglades national park.

238
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,390
It won't be long now.

239
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,420
I can hang this on doakes and then...

240
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,920
Then what?

241
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,590
Years of trials and appeals
with him pointing his finger

242
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,920
And calling me killer?

243
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:39,460
For such a neat monster, I'm
making an awfully big mess.

244
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,020
Where does this prick adams

245
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,890
Get off taking such
cheap shots at lundy?

246
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,460
I heard that doakes walked off

247
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,290
In the middle of lundy's questioning

248
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,920
And that lundy didn't stop him.

249
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,320
I might have heard that wrong.

250
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,520
Morgan.

251
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,390
Peters.

252
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,420
Nice hair, borelli.

253
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,020
I'm sure the johns up in boys town

254
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,360
Are loving that duran duran look.

255
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,860
What's the matter?

256
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,720
You meatheads lose your sense of humor?

257
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,560
Your joke wasn't funny.

258
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,420
We have a warrant for
detective batista's arrest.

259
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,420
Bullshit. for what?

260
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,190
A woman named lila tournay

261
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,820
Has filed sexual-assault
charges against him.

262
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,920
That fucking bitch.

263
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,420
Debra, it's okay. I
knew this was coming.

264
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,490
It's not okay. captain, lieutenant!

265
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,160
Put those away or I will
shove them up your ass!

266
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,690
What's going on here?

267
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,890
We've been asked to bring detective
batista upstairs for processing

268
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,660
I am sure that detective batista

269
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,490
Will go along with you peacefully.

270
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,320
It's not your fault.

271
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,420
I'll be okay.

272
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,790
It isn't my fault.

273
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,960
I warned angel.

274
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,390
Still, I hate to see him
disgraced in front of everyone.

275
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,060
And laguerta about to lose
her former partner, her friend.

276
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,520
Even lundy is caught

277
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,820
In hurricane dexter's
path of destruction.

278
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,490
Maybe this is how evil works.

279
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:59,220
Destroying everything it
touches... including my father.

280
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,220
Hey.

281
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,420
You're not gonna believe
the morning I'm having.

282
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,790
I know the feeling.

283
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,320
My car is stalled on harper and 3rd.

284
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,720
Think you can come get me?

285
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,360
Yeah, hang tight. I'll be right there.

286
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,160
Thanks, dex.

287
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,120
I'm the helpful handyman.
how evil can I possibly be?

288
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,720
I'm sparing rita and
deb by framing doakes.

289
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,060
Right?

290
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,260
Over here!

291
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,860
Thank god.

292
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,360
Eh, pana. que haces por aqu?

293
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,890
I've been held prisoner in
a cabin for two fucking days.

294
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,760
Caba?A? si, si, la caba?A.

295
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,960
Fucking hellhole.

296
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,260
Cual es la caba?A?

297
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,890
No, no. I don't want to go to the cabin.

298
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,660
La caba?A esta all?

299
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,260
I need you to get my ass out of here.

300
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,190
I'm a police sergeant.
miami metro homicide.

301
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,220
Policia?

302
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,920
Si, si. policia.

303
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,660
Vamanos.

304
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,760
I've got to run upstairs.

305
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,560
There's a whole batista thing going on.

306
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,290
- Lunch today?
- doubtful.

307
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,760
I've got to write up a status report

308
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,490
For deputy director adams.

309
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,220
Why'd they send that dipshit?

310
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,960
Washington gets nervous when
there's no movement on a case,

311
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,260
Especially one as big as this.

312
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,590
No movement?

313
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,620
You're the reason they found
the blood slides in doakes' car.

314
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,420
I'm also the one who let him get away.

315
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,460
We all let him get away.

316
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,720
I was in charge.

317
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,290
The evidence was there,

318
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,620
But something inside me wasn't
convinced he was our guy,

319
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,890
So I let him walk.

320
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,120
It was a bad call.

321
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,560
Now we might
never -

322
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,860
Stop it.

323
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,360
Stop what?

324
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,460
Acting like me.

325
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,160
You're a god.

326
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,590
Don't you forget it.

327
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,790
So, what do you think it is?

328
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,960
Carburetor.

329
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,260
Transmission.

330
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,090
That round, black hose thing.

331
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,990
I'm more a boat guy.

332
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,120
The last thing I need right
now is a major repair bill.

333
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,490
Throw in a tow and rental car,

334
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,020
There goes astor's piano lessons.

335
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,760
Here, take the mini-van.

336
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,220
No, I can't. it's too
big of an inconvenience.

337
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,890
You can drop me off back at work.

338
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,660
I'll borrow something
from the motor pool.

339
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,020
I'll make it up to you.

340
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,120
Dinner?

341
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,620
I have a better idea.

342
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,390
Pack a lunch, bring the kids,

343
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,760
Let me take you out
on the ocean tomorrow.

344
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,560
The kids have school tomorrow.

345
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,260
Think of it as a field trip.

346
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,120
You don't know cody's teacher.

347
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,420
It's just one day
- just one more day.

348
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,990
Is everything okay, dexter?

349
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,320
Look, after everything
we've been through lately,

350
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,590
I just want to be
together with you guys.

351
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,420
Is that selfish?

352
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,990
No.

353
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,260
No, it's lovely.

354
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,560
Sergeant doakes can rejoice.

355
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,990
I come bearing real food.

356
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,420
Shit.

357
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,390
Apurate. all?

358
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,090
Hey, vamanos.

359
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,360
No, no, no.

360
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,790
Suck my dick, motherfucker.
you understand that shit? huh?

361
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,390
Apurate.

362
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,960
Esteban?

363
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,260
Esteban!

364
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,790
Esteban, vamanos.

365
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,220
Gabr?N no mejor a ventellar.

366
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,660
Esteban!

367
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,660
Esteban?

368
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,490
Friends of yours?

369
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,890
From what I can tell,

370
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,290
They're friends of that drug dealer.

371
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,790
They would've killed me

372
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,620
Once I had all that coke on the boat.

373
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,860
Thanks, morgan.

374
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:25,390
Well, this is awkward.

375
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,820
I think we made some
alligators very happy.

376
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,520
So, here we are.

377
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,720
Back to fucking square one.

378
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,220
Not exactly.

379
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,790
I'll tell you what, james.

380
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,690
Can I call you james?

381
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,420
Knock yourself out.

382
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,420
I'm toying with an idea.

383
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,990
I've been under federal
investigation for two months.

384
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,320
My trophies were stolen.

385
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,990
Sorry.

386
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:18,190
The code I live by has been shattered.

387
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,620
And I have a co-worker in a cage.

388
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,390
Things aren't going so well.

389
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,090
No shit. I can see that.

390
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,760
You told me, "take
responsibility for what I am. "

391
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,720
You were right.

392
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,920
Harry killed the wrong person.

393
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,360
Morgan, you're not
thinking about -

394
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,520
Kill myself? no, that's pathetic.

395
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,160
But I can't live in this
house of cards anymore,

396
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,860
Waiting for it all to fall down.

397
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,690
I need to do something, you know?

398
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,360
I'm thinking about turning myself in.

399
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,190
That's a - that's
a good call, morgan.

400
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,190
That's a tough call,

401
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,220
But... that's a good call, man.

402
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,290
I need some fucking relief.

403
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,260
Yeah, you can't keep running, man.

404
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,560
That's for pussies.

405
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,990
You're just gonna end up in
exactly the same situation

406
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,020
Sooner or later.

407
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,660
Prison.

408
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,260
I could finally get some sleep.

409
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,820
Yeah.

410
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:51,720
In the long run would
be easier on deb...

411
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,560
Rita.

412
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,560
Better than watching me
dragged in like an animal...

413
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:05,490
Which, let's face it,
will happen, someday.

414
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,690
Yeah.

415
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,720
Morgan, we'll do it together.

416
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,490
I'll go with you.

417
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,290
Come on, let's go.

418
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,290
If I do this, I need a day
to get my affairs in order.

419
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,790
That's fine. tie me up, throw me
in the trunk. come on, let's go.

420
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,160
I brought supplies. fresh fruit.

421
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,160
Make sure you mention that

422
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,160
When they interview you
for the story of my life.

423
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,220
God damn it, you're not gonna leave me
in this cage - anything could happen.

424
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,290
What are you doing?

425
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,560
I think we've seen the worst of that.

426
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,290
Morgan!

427
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,490
Dexter.

428
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:45,190
I've really enjoyed our
conversations, james.

429
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:52,390
I lie to everyone I know...

430
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,520
Except my victims right
before I kill them.

431
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,760
It's hard to establish
much of a rapport there.

432
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,620
Sorry about the cage.

433
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,760
Morgan!

434
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,120
Fuck.

435
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,990
What?

436
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,890
Hey, deb. it's me. what
are you doing tonight?

437
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,960
I'm about to get off of work, why?

438
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,720
I've got some papers I need you to sign.

439
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,520
Papers? what kind of papers?

440
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,790
I'll explain when I see you.

441
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,790
Well, I'm meeting masuka
and batista for drinks.

442
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,790
Why don't you bring
the papers and join us?

443
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,460
How's angel doing?

444
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,820
How do you think he's doing?

445
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,760
You know, it's your
fault he's in this mess.

446
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,120
If you hadn't fucked elvira.

447
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,760
I'm not the best brother, am i?

448
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,320
Dexter, are you smoking something?

449
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,760
No.

450
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,720
I've always been curious to try.

451
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,990
Do you have any weed?

452
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,220
Okay, now I'm really worried.

453
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,760
There's no need to worry.

454
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,960
I'll bring by the papers tomorrow.

455
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,360
Bye, deb.

456
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,460
It's strange.

457
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,090
This should be difficult,

458
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,960
But a sense of peace
is settling over me.

459
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,760
Calm.

460
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,920
Maybe it's the moonlight.

461
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,890
Tom?

462
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,560
Can I meet you outside?

463
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,090
Oh, sure.

464
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,660
I'll check in back home.

465
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,520
I need a personal day.

466
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,860
I hope this is a joke.

467
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,890
Just one day.

468
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,720
I think I can prove
that james is innocent.

469
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,560
I was talking to a
couple of the fbi agents

470
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,760
Who were down
in haiti -

471
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,790
Jesus christ, maria.

472
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,790
We are in the middle of a manhunt.

473
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,190
You're down two detectives,
and now you want time off?

474
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,360
The answer is no.

475
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,160
This department can't
spare you right now.

476
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,560
This wasn't a request, tom.

477
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,320
I won't be here tomorrow.

478
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,390
I just wanted you to know that.

479
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,460
Diablo. what is this shit, masuka?

480
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,190
Hey, tequila's all the same.

481
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,160
Not when it's made from pumpkins.

482
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,490
Hey, we're not all
in the same pay grade.

483
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,720
If I lose my job over this,
bro, I won't have a pay grade.

484
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,320
That is not gonna happen.

485
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,320
Everyone at the station
knows you're innocent.

486
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,660
How am I gonna prove it?

487
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:03,760
Hmm? I can't explain the
roofies, the rough sex.

488
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,760
There was rough sex? it was her idea.

489
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:08,260
Now it's my word against
hers. I'm screwed.

490
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,020
Angel, you have got to fight back.

491
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,390
Dude, morgan's right.

492
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,520
You got to man up, get
tough. love's a battlefield.

493
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,720
Or, in your case, a restraining order.

494
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,560
Look, I appreciate you guys doing this,

495
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,260
But you don't have to stay.

496
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:26,120
Hey, does it ever floor you guys

497
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,090
That we had a killer right
under our noses this whole time?

498
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,620
I mean, who doesn't see that shit?

499
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,520
That didn't come out right.

500
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,920
It's all right.

501
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,090
That stuff doesn't bother me anymore.

502
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,790
Next round's on me.

503
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,560
Dexter.

504
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,320
I was wondering when you'd show up.

505
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,790
We need to talk.

506
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,420
Sounds good to me.

507
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,960
I'm making coffee. do you want one?

508
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,090
I'm here to ask you respectfully

509
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,320
To drop the charges against angel.

510
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,620
Dexter, if angel molested me,

511
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,620
As the evidence seems to indicate,

512
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,820
Then he should face the consequences,

513
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,320
Don't you think?

514
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,620
It doesn't matter what I think.

515
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,290
But here's what I know.

516
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,420
After tomorrow, I
won't be around anymore,

517
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,460
So there's no end game in this for you.

518
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,190
You're going somewhere?

519
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,690
It's looking more and more likely.

520
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,020
Where?

521
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,090
All that matters is that I'll
be out of reach permanently.

522
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,660
Oh, come on, dexter!

523
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,620
Tell me. I have a right to know.

524
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,560
You're the one who taught me about
accepting the things you can't change.

525
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,890
This is one of those things.

526
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,560
Goodbye, lila.

527
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,660
I don't understand how
men can be so stupid.

528
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,420
Well, not all men.

529
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,220
Yes, every single one of you.

530
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,120
I mean, how could dexter and batista

531
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,860
Be so easily duped by lila?

532
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,360
I took one
look at her -

533
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,690
I knew she was a walking nightmare.

534
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,720
That's not stupidity.

535
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,920
It's simply in our dna.

536
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,360
When a pretty girl smiles
and bats her eyelashes,

537
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,790
We're powerless to resist.

538
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,160
I'm worried about batista.

539
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,690
This is so fucked.

540
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,790
There's no way I'm gonna let
him take the fall for this.

541
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,120
What can you do?

542
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:51,360
Well... special agent lundy,

543
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,560
I was wondering if you might access

544
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,620
Those great, big fbi files of yours

545
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,890
And do a search on miss lila tournay.

546
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,920
You see? powerless to resist.

547
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,760
Is adams gonna be pissed off

548
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,220
When he sees you used
fbi files for this?

549
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,390
I certainly hope so.

550
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,520
She has no warrants.

551
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,890
No criminal record.

552
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,520
Nothing with the dmv.

553
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,060
And no social security number.

554
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,120
What about visas or
green cards or whatever?

555
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,590
Nothing. no records.

556
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:41,220
That's impossible.
everyone has a paper trail.

557
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,460
Everyone real.

558
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,560
That sneaky bitch. she's using an alias.

559
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,560
That would be my guess.

560
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,690
Well, how do I find
out lila's real name?

561
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,490
I think you know the answer to that.

562
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,260
Cut off her head, look for a label.

563
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:02,060
There's probably an easier way.

564
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,920
You got something smaller?

565
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,260
The last time lila was in my apartment,

566
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,060
She microwaved some popcorn.

567
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:18,590
There's definitely
gonna be prints on this.

568
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,920
All right, got it.

569
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,590
Next time, make her a cup of tea.

570
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,790
This is marlene from accounting.

571
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,690
Hi, marlene from accounting.

572
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,690
She's also a notary public.

573
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,820
Good for you.

574
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,320
I met with a lawyer yesterday,

575
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,860
And he helped me prepare a living trust

576
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,420
That gives you control off all my assets

577
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:50,920
In the event of my death
or certain other situations.

578
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,490
Oh, god. go away. this is creepy.

579
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,090
My financial planner said a
guy my age should have a will.

580
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,160
It's just a precaution.

581
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,160
We're all going to die eventually.

582
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,220
Okay. yeah.

583
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,620
Is this why you were
acting so weird last night?

584
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,690
Yeah, probably.

585
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,790
Sign here and here, and
I'll need to see an i. d.

586
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,720
Fine.

587
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,090
Thanks for showing up last
night to support batista.

588
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,360
I am supporting batista.

589
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,490
I stopped by lila's this morning.

590
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,660
And?

591
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,960
And I talked to her.

592
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,020
I don't think she's gonna be a problem.

593
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,860
Yeah, 'cause she certainly
hasn't been one so far.

594
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,060
Hey, I'm free tonight.

595
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,460
You want to stop by,
I'll pick up some beers,

596
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,120
Throw on a couple of steaks?

597
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,560
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

598
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,920
Sure. sounds good.

599
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,190
So, what am I getting?

600
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,460
I could use a new tv.

601
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,390
Okay. but that's the one.

602
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,720
Lundy here.

603
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,720
Oh, special agent lundy.

604
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,190
It's lieutenant laguerta.
I'm calling you from haiti.

605
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,360
Lovely this time of year.

606
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,190
I understand that I'm
not your favorite person

607
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,460
In the station right now,
but I really need your help.

608
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,860
How so?

609
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,090
I just met with leones,

610
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,960
The travel agent that doakes saw.

611
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,490
There's nothing new there.

612
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,620
I had two agents question him for hours.

613
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,320
Yet he never told them
about the blood slides.

614
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,790
What does he know
about the blood slides?

615
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,060
Doakes was looking for a
lab to have them analyzed.

616
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,120
Why?

617
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,490
I don't know why.

618
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,460
If he's our killer, he'd be
keeping them for trophies.

619
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,260
He'd have no reason
to have them analyzed.

620
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:31,920
And I also have a list
of special-ops missions

621
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,790
That leones personally
knows doakes took part in.

622
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,460
Now, two of them directly
conflict with murders

623
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:40,660
We know to have been committed
by the bay harbor butcher.

624
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:43,120
I'm not sure leones is
our most reliable witness.

625
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,590
No, but it's worth
looking into, isn't it?

626
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,390
Yes. yes, it is.

627
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,220
Yes! okay.

628
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:59,090
For starters, why don't you
brief me on both those missions?

629
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,920
Give me all the details.

630
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,160
Come on, cody. up and over.

631
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,460
Okay. great.

632
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:10,090
Okay, astor. up and over.

633
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,660
There we go.

634
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,790
Watch your step.

635
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:34,390
Look, there's a pelican.

636
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,590
What's that?

637
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,260
Welcome to the gps 3000 teletracker.

638
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,820
Previous destinations.

639
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,860
For so long my boat has been
a tool of my dark trade -

640
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,420
A graveyard transport.

641
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,590
I'd almost forgotten it could
double as a pleasure craft.

642
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,990
Now, the thing is, 
if you catch a whale,

643
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,320
We're probably gonna
have to put it back.

644
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,890
If it's a baby, we could
put it in the bathtub.

645
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,120
I'm not gonna take a bath with a whale.

646
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,460
I know, they always use up all the soap.

647
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,660
It's peaceful out here.

648
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,690
Rita, I've never been
a very good boyfriend.

649
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,060
I wouldn't say that.

650
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,420
I just need you to know
that you and the kids

651
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,560
Are very important to me.

652
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:27,360
No matter what happens, I
want you to always know that.

653
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,820
Okay, dexter.

654
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:37,260
Hey, everything's all right.

655
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,220
Okay?

656
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,490
I just - I just need
to take things slow.

657
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,260
Oh, I have a gift for you.

658
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,520
Dexter, you don't
need to bring me gifts.

659
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,020
I want you to have this.

660
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,990
It's the pink slip to the mini-van.

661
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,590
Dexter, I told you everything's okay.

662
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,190
You
don't -

663
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,520
Please, I want you to
have it for the kids.

664
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,220
It'll keep them safer than
a broken-down convertible.

665
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,690
Thank you.

666
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,320
Very generous.

667
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,790
You're welcome.

668
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,990
I know I've been taking
things slow with us,

669
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,460
But it's not because I
don't have feelings for you.

670
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:21,290
It's more like I have 
too many feelings,

671
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,290
And I just want to make
sure to get it right.

672
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,420
Me too.

673
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:42,320
That's not exactly taking it slow.

674
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,720
Sorry. I'll never do that again.

675
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,320
Well, don't say never.

676
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,060
I was just looking for you.

677
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,160
The boys looked at lila's prints.

678
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,320
We hit the jackpot.

679
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,390
Oh?

680
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,090
Turns out her real name is lila west.

681
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,560
I ran her prints through the afis,

682
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,720
Which is tied to i. c. e.

683
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,260
Get this - her visa
expired two years ago.

684
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,420
Bad girl.

685
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,320
I can have her deported.

686
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,290
Not as easy as it sounds.

687
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,260
Miami is swamped with
criminal immigrants,

688
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,860
Refugees from third-world countries.

689
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,120
They'll take priority
over some british girl.

690
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,660
Then I'll deport her myself.

691
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,260
We got him.

692
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,420
Doakes?

693
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,020
Talked to a park-service
manager in the everglades

694
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,190
Who remembers giving sergeant
doakes directions five days ago.

695
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,290
So you have a
tip - not doakes.

696
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,220
The park manager said our target
was headed into the everglades

697
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,890
15 miles north of sunday bay.

698
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,120
We will have the son of a
bitch in handcuffs in 24 hours.

699
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,620
I'd like to urge strong caution
in apprehending the suspect.

700
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,920
I'm looking into new information
that might come into play -

701
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,120
Yeah, I got your e-mail about leones.

702
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,390
The man will say anything for a dollar.

703
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,090
I agree we have to be
circumspect about this,

704
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,060
Which is exactly 
why I'd like some time.

705
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,360
Show a little guts, 
for christ's sakes.

706
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,390
Why don't you show a little respect?

707
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,520
You wouldn't be closing
in on a suspect right now

708
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,090
If it wasn't for the work of this man.

709
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,390
You know, as much as I enjoy
hearing from the local talent,

710
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,460
I'm really rather busy right now.

711
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,490
Well, I'm guessing you don't need me

712
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,890
To fight your battles anymore.

713
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,860
Yeah, well, maybe you
need me to fight yours.

714
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:24,090
Ooh. aren't you a tough one?

715
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,890
I'm just warming up.

716
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,120
Wow. I thought I lived in a shit can.

717
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:45,760
Officer morgan, have you come
to inquire about my welfare?

718
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:48,220
I want you to leave miami tonight.

719
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,720
Don't ever come back.

720
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,560
Don't ever contact
angel or dexter again.

721
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,990
And, um, why would I listen to you?

722
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,120
Cause I'm a cop.

723
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,460
And you're here on an expired visa.

724
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,160
I know your real name,

725
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,020
And I've contacted immigration.

726
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,990
Officers will be here any day now.

727
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,420
They'll arrest you and deport you,

728
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,460
And it will not be pretty.

729
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,660
If this is true,

730
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,820
Why are you telling me this?

731
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,320
Because I want you the
fuck out of here now.

732
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,120
Whether you leave on your own

733
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,490
Or immigration hauls
your sorry ass away,

734
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,660
I don't give a shit.

735
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:27,020
But I don't want to
give you one more day

736
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,990
To fuck with the people I care about.

737
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,490
I want you gone.

738
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,520
Tonight.

739
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,820
You don't want to do this.

740
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:38,420
It's done.

741
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,220
Tonight.

742
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,820
Welcome. previous destination.

743
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,160
Starting route guidance.

744
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,060
Left turn ahead.

745
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:25,220
I keep expecting to come to my senses,

746
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:29,790
But the pressure is lifting
with each step I take.

747
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:33,290
I've spent a lifetime
keeping up my guard,

748
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,960
Watching my back, wearing my mask.

749
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:40,920
Relief was never in sight until now.

750
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:46,320
If anyone deserves to take
me into custody, it's deb.

751
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,160
But how do I tell her what I am?

752
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,990
Deb, I'm the bay harbor butcher.

753
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,360
Deb, I'm the bay harbor butcher.

754
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:15,420
On the ground.

755
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,660
Down on the ground, motherfucker.

756
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:20,790
It's me. I'm the bay harbor butcher.

757
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,820
No, no, no, no, no.

758
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:26,390
I'm him -
the butcher.

759
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:32,720
This isn't going to be easy.

760
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:40,320
I brought extra beer.
we're getting drunk.

761
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,290
Fine with me.

762
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,090
What's the occasion?

763
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:54,720
I ran lila out of town today.

764
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,060
Really? yeah.

765
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,120
Turns out she's here illegally.

766
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,160
You should have seen me, dex.

767
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,660
I was like an old-west sheriff.

768
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:10,290
You're really feeling good.

769
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,460
Fuck, yeah.

770
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,290
I got to say, great timing, dex,

771
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,660
Getting together tonight.

772
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,190
The last few months, I
was starting to feel like

773
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,190
I had my head pretty far up my ass.

774
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,290
No one blames you.

775
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,260
Your world was turned upside down.

776
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:29,360
Like mine is now.

777
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:32,060
For the first time since
that ice-truck killer shit,

778
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:34,090
I feel like I'm back.

779
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,120
New and improved, even.

780
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,890
When all that stuff
was happening -

781
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,090
With rudy, I mean...

782
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,220
...did you ever consider
doing something drastic?

783
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,060
Are you kidding?

784
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:13,520
All kinds of fucked-up
shit ran through my head.

785
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,590
Thank god I had you.

786
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,560
Really?

787
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:18,820
Yeah.

788
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,960
Every time I started
to spin out of control,

789
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:22,590
I had you to grab onto.

790
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:26,760
Hell, you let me live
here practically forever.

791
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:28,120
It was tough, though.

792
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,160
I'd have done almost anything

793
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:32,960
To get out from under
the weight of it all.

794
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,890
How'd you finally do it?

795
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:46,990
I just - just
saw through it.

796
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,920
You know?

797
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,860
You decide who you are,
who you want to be...

798
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:01,220
...and you hold onto
that and ride it out.

799
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,890
Like an old-west sheriff.

800
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,920
Brother, this is worth living for.

801
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:26,990
Right?

802
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:36,520
You are absolutely right.

803
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,790
Hey, what did you want to
talk to me about, anyway?

804
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:45,160
Oh... nothing.

805
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,660
Nothing at all.

806
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,560
So, this is me, riding it out.

807
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:00,990
Harry may have rejected me,
but deb clearly believes in me,

808
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,490
So why shouldn't i?

809
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,420
I'm not turning myself in.

810
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,520
This isn't harry's life.

811
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,020
It's mine.

812
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:11,520
I made a plan to frame doakes,
and I'm going to stick with it.

813
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,720
Morgan.

814
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,220
No shit?

815
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,920
Okay. okay, I'm on the way.

816
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,060
They found doakes' fucking rental car.

817
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,360
They found
- really?

818
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:32,090
His car?

819
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,320
Did they find doakes?

820
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,390
No, not yet. but the
search grid's closing in.

821
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,320
Come on, we got to get to the station.

822
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,790
Actually I got to make sure

823
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,760
They don't find doakes in a cage.

824
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:54,420
Hallelujah.

825
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,120
Hey!

826
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,620
Hey, I'm in here!

827
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:02,390
Who's out there?! anybody out there?!

828
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,390
Ending route guidance.

829
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,960
Hello?

830
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:20,560
Somebody in there?

831
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:23,760
You have arrived at your destination.
