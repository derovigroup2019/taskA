<font color="#ffff00">Dexter S02E07</font>

4
00:01:44,568 --> 00:01:46,600
<i>Dexter: previously on "dexter"...</i>

5
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:48,568
If you were the bay harbor butcher,

6
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,034
Would you use a place like this?

7
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:52,767
The conditions in this space don't support his m.O.

8
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,900
Maybe the butcher's having an identity crisis.

9
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:56,167
Your brother's a junkie.

10
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:58,700
<i>Are you high? He's never even smoked a cigarette.</i>

11
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:00,367
Gail: looks like cody's enjoying himself.

12
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:02,034
Dexter's very patient with him.

13
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:03,401
Dexter's a saint.

14
00:02:03,434 --> 00:02:05,468
I was hoping you could dig up an old case file for me.

15
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:06,633
Got a date?

16
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:08,733
It's the crime scene where harry found me.

17
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:09,867
<i>Harry: how much?</i>

18
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,733
<i>Woman: 300 bricks, give or take.</i>

19
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:14,234
I've been waiting for a chance to take your ass out.

20
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,767
I know how you feel, sergeant.

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,434
He crossed the line, lieutenant. He broke into my lab.

22
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:20,034
He's probably gonna start tailing me again.

23
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:21,767
Sergeant doakes tailed you?

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,000
I followed him to an n.A. Meeting.

25
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:24,534
That asshole lied about that, too.

26
00:02:24,568 --> 00:02:26,134
You're obsessed. I'm not.

27
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:27,501
And i need you to see it!

28
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:30,034
Dinner was fantastic, rita. Wow.

29
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,167
I kind of like her.

30
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:34,301
Lila: dex, just calling to check in.

31
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:35,967
Imagine rita's face if i told her

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,334
That you and i had spent the night together in a hotel.

33
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,667
It's over, dexter.

34
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,534
I guess i just hope with lundy it will be different.

35
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:44,201
Why? I respect him.

36
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:45,600
<i>You love him.</i>

37
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,800
No. He's like my dad.

38
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,700
You want to tell me what's going on?

39
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:52,234
You're the one who said i'm supposed to feel my feelings!

40
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:54,367
Well, now i'm telling you to get them under control!

41
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:05,834
Which step was that?

42
00:03:11,544 --> 00:03:14,450
That night. A forest Grew

43
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:22,534
Lila: use the entire canvas.

44
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:27,034
Start from the top. Work your way down.

45
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:31,167
Light, feathery strokes.

46
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:33,101
Perfect!

47
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:34,733
Stunning.

48
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:38,468
Try longer strokes now.

49
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:40,468
Perfect.

50
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:01,267
You really know what you want, don't you?

51
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,334
I hope you don't mind.

52
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,334
Some men do.

53
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:13,234
No.

54
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:16,967
I've always found instruction manuals...

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,401
Quite useful.

56
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:27,468
Okay, your turn.

57
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:31,134
<i>What do you want?</i>

58
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:37,367
I think that was it.

59
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:40,667
Hmm, come on.

60
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,967
You must have some dark fantasies...

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,834
...unfulfilled urges.

62
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:54,334
I'm pretty good at acting on those.

63
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:57,534
Really?

64
00:04:57,568 --> 00:04:59,501
Then fuck me like that.

65
00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:16,967
Your light's burned out.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,600
It's the wiring.

67
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:23,334
I've been asking my landlord to fix it for weeks.

68
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:27,667
Well, now i can see better.

69
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,301
That's where my landlord lives.

70
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:32,267
Now he'll have to fix it.

71
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,501
See you later.

72
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:46,267
<i>Got to admire lila for taking things into her own hands.</i>

73
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:48,434
<i>That includes me.</i>

74
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,134
Ohh. Mom.

75
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:57,834
Come on, let's go! No more moping.

76
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:00,034
I'm not moping. I'm sleeping.

77
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:02,034
Oversleeping -- Third time this week.

78
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:03,834
The only way you're gonna get over dexter

79
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:06,834
Is if you take charge of your day.

80
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,234
Come on. You're not in high school anymore.

81
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:15,334
Go scrub your face, and i'll heat up some oatmeal.

82
00:06:22,568 --> 00:06:25,401
Didn't hear you come in last night.

83
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:29,101
Well, it was late. I was quiet.

84
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:31,367
Yeah, you're good at quiet.

85
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:33,834
Guess you kind of have to be with me crashing here

86
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:36,600
And rita's mom over there.

87
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:39,067
You and rita fuck quiet, too?

88
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:41,367
And she's off, right out of the gate.

89
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,900
Because me -- I wake the goddamn dead.

90
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:45,167
It's a problem.

91
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:46,867
Oh, i know, only too well.

92
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,201
Scary, right?

93
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:50,401
Sometimes i disturb myself.

94
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:53,434
So what kind of noises does rita make?

95
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:56,800
Could we not talk about sex...

96
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,267
Or rita?

97
00:06:58,301 --> 00:07:00,900
Why?

98
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:04,767
'Cause we broke up...

99
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,134
For real.

100
00:07:09,157 --> 00:07:10,325
It's over.

101
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,067
You break up, you get back together --

102
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,401
That's just what goes on.

103
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:17,334
I mean, you and rita are forever.

104
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:20,134
Just say you're sorry and send some fucking flowers.

105
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,600
You're not hearing me.

106
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:26,167
Look, when all this blows over,

107
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:29,900
I'll spend a few days at gabriel's, and...

108
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:32,967
You can screw rita as loud as you want.

109
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:46,600
Big news, dex.

110
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,501
Whoa! Feel like i got caught in a wave.

111
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:52,434
<i>The miami tribune received a 32-Page manifesto in the mail.</i>

112
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:54,633
It's looking good for the bay harbor butcher.

113
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,800
Well, i've heard that one before.

114
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:58,167
Look, this may be legit.

115
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:00,934
The manifesto includes the names of three victims

116
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:02,834
We never released to the press.

117
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,434
Oh, that is big news.

118
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:08,134
<i>I'm heading over to the tribune now for special agent lundy.</i>

119
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,501
He put me in charge of the team.

120
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:11,534
Go, angel.

121
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:14,401
Yeah, i'm psyched.

122
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:19,000
<i>Yeah, me too. I'm about to be published.</i>

123
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:21,934
<i>I sent that manifesto to the tribune.</i>

124
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:25,501
<i>Guess i've been taking some cues from lila lately,</i>

125
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:27,067
<i>And not just in bed.</i>

126
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:32,234
<i>I'm tired of reacting to the moves of agent lundy
And his super posse.</i>

127
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:35,568
<i>Time to control their actions for a change.</i>

128
00:08:58,101 --> 00:09:01,767
Betsy court, 16. Blunt-Force beating.

129
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,633
It looks like she was sunning herself

130
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:04,800
And never saw it coming.

131
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:06,334
Who called in the body?

132
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:11,834
Craig wilson, the stepfather. He's right over there.

133
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:16,468
Wilson told the reporting officer

134
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:20,134
That he came home for lunch and found her that way.

135
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,600
Um, you and dexter resolve your issues?

136
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:23,834
As far as i'm concerned.

137
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:25,934
Why? The bitch come crying to you again?

138
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,134
No.

139
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,667
There's blood work to be done here,

140
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,167
And if you can't control yourself,

141
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:31,733
I need to call in another detective.

142
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:34,000
I won't say anything to hurt the little girl's feelings.

143
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:35,534
God damn it, james, i'm not joking.

144
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:36,700
Do i look like i'm laughing?

145
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:39,767
No. You don't. I wish you would. You used to.

146
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,401
Bullshit. I never laughed.

147
00:09:41,434 --> 00:09:44,367
Yeah, you know what? You're probably right.

148
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,267
Now, look, i'm not gonna try to scare you anymore.

149
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:49,468
The reality is, you're out of free passes.

150
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:51,468
Now, i already stopped dexter from filing a complaint

151
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:52,867
Against you once.

152
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,434
I never asked you to do that, maria. Well, i did it,

153
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:57,900
Out of my own concern over your obsessive behavior.

154
00:09:57,934 --> 00:09:59,767
Now i'm on the line,

155
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,301
So if you bully dexter in any way --

156
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,633
If you even look at him wrong,

157
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,367
I will not be responsible for the fallout.

158
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:05,767
You got it?

159
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,900
I got it.

160
00:10:08,196 --> 00:10:09,733
You're backing the fucking freaktard.

161
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:11,201
James.

162
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:24,900
Where you been, dexter?

163
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:27,101
You don't bring me doughnuts.

164
00:10:27,134 --> 00:10:30,167
You don't sing me love songs. How are you, camilla?

165
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,301
I've been better.

166
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,468
Well, that doesn't sound good.

167
00:10:41,987 --> 00:10:44,800
Sergeant doakes dropped by my file room yesterday.

168
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:46,667
He requested the case files

169
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,201
For the 1973 shipping-Yard murders.

170
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:51,267
I gave him the same line i gave you

171
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:53,134
When you came sniffing around,

172
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,867
Said all that old stuff was boxed up

173
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,000
In the basement of city hall.

174
00:10:57,034 --> 00:11:00,633
That made him real angry.

175
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,633
He scared me, dexter.

176
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:06,367
That's not right. He shouldn't do that.

177
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:10,767
Look, dex, i always assumed that your father asked me

178
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,900
To destroy those files to protect you.

179
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:17,367
Now i'm not sure what's going on.

180
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:18,367
Camilla...

181
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:20,468
Now, i don't want to know.

182
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:23,334
I just don't want to get fired.

183
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:25,367
I'm retiring next year. Did i tell you?

184
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:28,967
I've been looking forward to staying home with gene.

185
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,267
You won't lose your retirement. I won't let that happen.

186
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:35,733
I can stall sergeant doakes for a few days,

187
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:38,267
But eventually, he'll figure out

188
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:40,334
That that case file's missing, just like you did.

189
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,234
And he'll track it back to me, you know, just like you did.

190
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:46,867
I'll take care of this. You have my word.

191
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,328
<i>So much for threatening doakes.</i>

192
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:58,600
<i>He won't back off till he exposes the twisted branches</i>

193
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,034
<i>Of my family tree,</i>

194
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:03,067
<i>From my father's indiscretions to my murderous brother</i>

195
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:07,633
<i>To the root of all evil -- Me.</i>

196
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:22,568
Hey.

197
00:12:23,514 --> 00:12:25,101
<i>Why aren't you at the tribune?</i>

198
00:12:25,101 --> 00:12:26,333
What for?

199
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,800
Our guy's not gonna leave dna evidence on a document.

200
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,334
Oh, but the thrill of the hunt.

201
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:32,800
I've had that particular thrill.

202
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:34,101
I'll leave it to younger men.

203
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:37,600
Besides, it's easier for me to do my part from he.

204
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,267
Yeah? What part is that?

205
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:44,600
Operating on favors, political leanings, posturing.

206
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:49,067
I've been trying to find the right music.

207
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:51,767
Right.

208
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,468
So, i'm off duty today,

209
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:56,034
But here are those marina reports.

210
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,867
And after my workout,

211
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,101
I'll swing by and pick up a copy of the manifesto.

212
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:03,434
Look at that board.

213
00:13:03,468 --> 00:13:07,800
These kills are precise, but there's also a fluidity,

214
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:10,201
Even some improvisation.

215
00:13:10,234 --> 00:13:14,334
If i could just find the music...

216
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:17,601
Want to borrow my ipod?

217
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:20,801
Got any chopin?

218
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:24,400
No. Fresh out of chopin.

219
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:28,300
Shit. Chopin's perfect.

220
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:30,001
Did you just swear?

221
00:13:30,034 --> 00:13:31,534
What can i say?

222
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,300
You're rubbing off on me, morgan.

223
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:36,500
<i>But chopin is perfect.</i>

224
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:40,167
So this is how you do what y do.

225
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,133
The truth speaks to me from a peaceful place.

226
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:50,634
I got to set the stage to hear it.

227
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:52,133
You know what i mean?

228
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:53,867
No.

229
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,834
I thrive on chaos.

230
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:07,167
But this is good, too.

231
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:24,667
I didn't kill her.

232
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:26,801
I was just trying to stop the blood.

233
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:27,834
Just the...

234
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:31,434
<i>No forceful impact spatter --</i>

235
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:34,767
<i>He's telling the truth. I can tell.</i>

236
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:36,133
Palms up, please.

237
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:44,034
When i found betsy, she was still breathing.

238
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:45,701
I wanted to help her.

239
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:50,267
You believe me, right?

240
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,068
I'm just the lab guy, mr. Wilson. Sorry.

241
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:56,767
Arms down at your sides, please.

242
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,968
<i>Blood misting. Huh.</i>

243
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:10,367
I need to collect his shirt for evidence.

244
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:17,434
Morgan!

245
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:22,534
The girl's mother was at work,

246
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,233
But she isn't really defending her husband.

247
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:27,068
Wilson and his stepdaughter fought all the time.

248
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,162
The neighbors heard him yelling at her this morning.

249
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:32,068
Then he comes home for lunch -- Motive and opportunity.

250
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,434
What'd the blood say?

251
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,467
Well, the blood on his hands could have come

252
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,034
From trying to help her, like he claims.

253
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:44,068
But i did detect, uh, blood mist on his shirt.

254
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,434
A blood mist --

255
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:48,400
The kind that comes from beating on a teenage girl?

256
00:15:48,434 --> 00:15:50,500
<i>No. Yes.</i>

257
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,601
You're absolutely sure?

258
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:54,400
<i>It's too fine for a bludgeoning.</i>

259
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:56,068
The mist is from a bludgeoning.

260
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,400
Medium-Velocity impact spatters -- No doubt about it.

261
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:01,667
Okay, morgan.

262
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:03,467
Just make sure you get me your blood report

263
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,867
As soon as possible.

264
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:14,233
<i>This is my chance to make doakes go away</i>

265
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:17,267
<i>Without spilling a single drop of his blood.</i>

266
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,567
<i>Of course, i have to sell an innocent man down the river.</i>

267
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:26,434
<i>Sorry, mr. Wilson, but i won't let you float too far.</i>

268
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:37,267
I was just thinking about you.

269
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,701
<i>Hmm. I like the sound of that.</i>

270
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:42,867
Yeah, i had to do a little creative problem-Solving

271
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,801
At someone else's expense.

272
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:46,200
Bravo.

273
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:48,068
Yeah, i figured you'd like that.

274
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,400
What's up?

275
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:52,133
Well, you know that art installation

276
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,601
That i've been working on?

277
00:16:53,634 --> 00:16:55,400
The cannibals.

278
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:59,634
They're not cannibals. How barbaric!

279
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,167
Their eating is symbolic

280
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,100
Of the way we consume others to feed our needs.

281
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:05,701
That's what i meant.

282
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,567
Well, it sold.

283
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:11,400
I-I didn't even create it to sell, but one of my buyers

284
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:14,200
Fell in love with it, and i named an outrageous price,

285
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,901
And she paid me a deposit on the spot.

286
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:19,934
So...

287
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:22,100
You in the mood to celebrate?

288
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:31,544
Definitely.

289
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:48,734
I'm afraid we just can't seat you tonight

290
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:49,968
Without a reservation.

291
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:52,367
As you can see, we are completely at capacity.

292
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,701
Oh, well --

293
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:54,851
No, i'm sorry. You have to help us.

294
00:17:54,851 --> 00:17:56,599
I made this reservation two months ago.

295
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:59,867
This is our 10-Year anniversary.

296
00:17:59,901 --> 00:18:03,034
This is the place where dexter proposed to me --

297
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:06,667
On the patio, in front of the fountain.

298
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,068
He told me to make a wish, and when i looked down,

299
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,701
There was my diamond ring, sparkling under the water.

300
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:19,068
That is so romantic.

301
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:22,534
Dexter: in case you're wondering,

302
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,867
There's nothing sparkling under that water tonight.

303
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:28,400
Oh, i'm sure
you'll dazzle me somehow.

304
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:31,701
You're a creative problem-Solver now, right?

305
00:18:31,734 --> 00:18:35,534
A changed man, or at least "changing."

306
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:37,200
I suppose.

307
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,701
There's no supposing about it, dexter.

308
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:42,200
You've taken control of your addiction

309
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:44,167
In a way that few people do.

310
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:46,434
It's been about a week

311
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:49,267
Since we've even discussed your rovery.

312
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,867
I think you're right.

313
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:54,767
And you haven't felt the need to use?

314
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,701
Incredibly, no. I feel...

315
00:18:57,734 --> 00:19:03,467
You know, like i'm finally in control of things again.

316
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:08,434
We call that warm fuzzy feeling the pink cloud.

317
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:12,767
It's when an addict experiences acceptance for the first time.

318
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:16,267
You're saying it won't last?

319
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:20,434
I'm saying that you have to work it -- That's all.

320
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:23,101
But i know that you will,

321
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:28,434
Because i believe that we've found a true substitute
For your addiction.

322
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:34,233
Life.

323
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:45,667
You're making us all look bad.

324
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:47,534
I'm the manager of il bistro vino.

325
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,367
Happy anniversary -- On the house.

326
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,500
Thank you.

327
00:19:51,534 --> 00:19:53,634
Oh, did you hear that, darling?

328
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,634
Oh, i heard it, darling.

329
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:57,767
Enjoy your evening.

330
00:19:57,801 --> 00:20:00,200
Thank you.

331
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,667
Happy anniversary, my love.

332
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,267
Aren't we in recovery?

333
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,867
Oh, this? It's just bubbles.

334
00:20:05,901 --> 00:20:07,801
We're not gonna shoot it up, are we?

335
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:11,767
You really have a way. You know that?

336
00:20:11,801 --> 00:20:13,034
A way of what?

337
00:20:13,068 --> 00:20:14,522
Of whatever the hell you want.

338
00:20:14,522 --> 00:20:19,001
Well, here's to 10 more glorious years

339
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:21,300
Of whatever the hell i want.

340
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:31,701
Hi, i'm cody, and i researched saudi arabia

341
00:20:31,734 --> 00:20:33,300
For my cultural report.

342
00:20:33,334 --> 00:20:34,567
Gail: that's good, sweetie.

343
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,601
Now, look at me when you talk, okay?

344
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:38,367
And try and stand up straight.

345
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,667
My board is covered in sand

346
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:45,100
Because saudi arabia is one big desert.

347
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:46,968
<i>One great big desert.</i>

348
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:48,734
<i>One great big desert.</i>

349
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,367
It only rains in a tiny corner of the country,

350
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,667
So they save rainwater --

351
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:56,834
Okay, now, try and keep your fingers off your face.

352
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:59,167
You don't want people to think you're picking your nose.

353
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,667
You mean like this?

354
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:05,901
Cody, you need to take this seriously.

355
00:21:05,934 --> 00:21:09,001
Dexter said it should be fun.

356
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:12,300
Dexter does drugs. He's wrong.

357
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:14,001
I finished my homework.

358
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:15,801
For the week?

359
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:20,400
Hey, guys. I'm home.

360
00:21:20,434 --> 00:21:21,601
Mom! Sorry i'm so late.

361
00:21:21,634 --> 00:21:23,400
I'm so happy to see you!

362
00:21:23,434 --> 00:21:25,133
Mom!

363
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,334
Oh, wow! What a greeting.

364
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:30,068
Okay, why don't you guys go get ready for bed?

365
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,034
Really, mom? I just got home.

366
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:33,267
They need their rest.

367
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,601
I will be in in just a minute to check on you.

368
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:42,233
Those two are making great progress.

369
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,133
Progress -- Towards what?

370
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,534
Their full potential!

371
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,534
Mom, i know you're really good at these things,

372
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:53,867
But now that you're here,

373
00:21:53,901 --> 00:21:55,867
Have you thought about applying for a teaching job?

374
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:59,267
No, i'm through with the schools.

375
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,801
Well, i thought teaching was your life.

376
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:04,867
And your children are going to be the beneficiaries

377
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:06,534
Of all that i have to offer.

378
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:12,367
<i>Our injunction stopped the tribune</i>

379
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,601
From publishing the manifesto -- For now.

380
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,734
At the very least,

381
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:18,534
We'll have time to get a jump on things

382
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:20,400
Before the news frenzy hits.

383
00:22:20,434 --> 00:22:23,767
So, let's take advantage of this window.

384
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:27,133
Our goal for the next 48 hours is to wade through

385
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:29,434
This shining piece of social commentary.

386
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:32,867
I've never seen so many dense and convoluted ideas in my life,

387
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:36,500
But we need to search them all for clues to his identity.

388
00:22:36,534 --> 00:22:39,534
So, first impressions? I got something.

389
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,834
There are a lot of literary references in this document.

390
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,400
How do you know? I like to read books.

391
00:22:44,434 --> 00:22:45,634
What kind of books?

392
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:47,534
All kinds. Who cares?

393
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:52,767
Anyway...i see lots of references, like this one.

394
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:55,934
"You can't depend on your eyes

395
00:22:55,968 --> 00:22:58,434
When your imagination is out of focus."

396
00:22:59,793 --> 00:23:00,968
He's a trekker!

397
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:03,567
That shit's straight from "deep space nine."

398
00:23:03,601 --> 00:23:06,034
What? Mark twain said that.

399
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:08,100
It's one of his most famous quotes.

400
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:10,667
Twain was never on "deep space nine."

401
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:12,001
He was on "next generation."

402
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:13,667
He didn't say it on "star trek."

403
00:23:13,701 --> 00:23:14,767
Okay, so what's it from?

404
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:17,734
"A connecticut yankee in king arthur's court."

405
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:24,167
Angel, what other literary quotes are in that manifesto?

406
00:23:29,528 --> 00:23:34,001
This guy -- He's the best boxing student i have ever had.

407
00:23:34,034 --> 00:23:37,034
After four weeks, he's getting in shots to my head.

408
00:23:37,068 --> 00:23:39,367
And finally he says, "i think i'm ready."

409
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,934
I'm like, "you're ready for what?"

410
00:23:41,968 --> 00:23:46,133
And he says, "to kick my mom's ass."

411
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,100
I'm like, "you're learning how to box

412
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:50,133
Because you want to beat up your mom?"

413
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:19,667
What the fuck?!

414
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:21,068
Did -- Did you hear what i said?

415
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,200
I was gonna hit the showers.

416
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:23,834
I'll meet you back here in 10 minutes.

417
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:26,233
Okay, yeah, 10 minutes.

418
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:51,634
<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>

419
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:56,534
Oh, hi! I'm lila.

420
00:24:56,567 --> 00:24:58,667
Oh, pardon my tits.

421
00:24:58,701 --> 00:25:02,167
Um, we thought you were crashing at your boyfriend's tonight.

422
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,934
We -- We who?

423
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:06,334
Dexter and i.

424
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:10,767
Could you just...wait here a minute?

425
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:17,834
Who's the skank?

426
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:20,068
Deb, did knocking occur to you?

427
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,601
Who is she?

428
00:25:21,634 --> 00:25:23,901
And are you trying to fuck her or set her on fire?

429
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,467
I didn't do this to you when you were riding square-Jaw guy

430
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,734
With the handcuffs.

431
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:29,968
That's different.

432
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:32,734
I wasn't cheating on anyone with gabriel.

433
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:35,400
How could you do this to rita, not to mention her kids?

434
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:36,767
You're like their father.

435
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,968
<i>Hey, rita broke up with me, okay?</i>

436
00:25:40,486 --> 00:25:43,267
You fucked up, dex...

437
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,534
...big-Time.

438
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:47,934
Ew. Excuse me.

439
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:04,834
Don't worry.

440
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:07,534
She just needs some time to adjust -- That's all.

441
00:26:12,601 --> 00:26:15,167
I had officers tear apart the stepfather's house --

442
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,734
No murder weapon, but he had to hide it somewhere.

443
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:19,634
Where is wilson now? Interview room 2.

444
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:23,734
We still have him? Why didn't his lawyer post bond?

445
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:26,267
Well, he tried, but i pulled in a favor at the courthouse

446
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,500
And got a bail enhancement,

447
00:26:27,534 --> 00:26:29,434
So they had to start the paperwork all over again.

448
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:31,534
I'm gonna break that cocksucker today.

449
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:34,968
What evidence you say we got on this guy?

450
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:36,801
He was dripping in the victim's blood.

451
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:38,300
He was home alone with her.

452
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:40,801
They fought the morning of the murder. All circumstantial.

453
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:43,200
Yeah, but the blood spatter on his shirt was a direct result

454
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:44,601
Of a blunt-Force beating, maria.

455
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:47,567
I'd like to see the blood report.

456
00:26:47,601 --> 00:26:49,434
You'll get it as soon as i do.

457
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:52,667
If you're looking for me, i'll be questioning the suspect.

458
00:27:09,634 --> 00:27:12,734
<i>They're still playing my tune.</i>

459
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:18,200
<i>It's like i'm conducting a final symphony,</i>

460
00:27:18,233 --> 00:27:20,767
<i>"Requiem for demonic dexter."</i>

461
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,567
<i>And forming the entire brass section,</i>

462
00:27:29,601 --> 00:27:32,133
<i>Sergeant james doakes.</i>

463
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:33,601
<i>When i reach the end,</i>

464
00:27:33,634 --> 00:27:35,334
<i>Maybe i can lay to rest the monster</i>

465
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:37,334
<i>Formerly known as dexter.</i>

466
00:27:39,505 --> 00:27:42,500
<i>Just hang in there, mr. Wilson.</i>

467
00:27:56,068 --> 00:27:58,767
I've asked a psycholinguist at m.I.T.

468
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:00,534
To analyze our manifesto.

469
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:04,167
His computer tabulates punctuation, misspellings,

470
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,901
And sentence structure to identify a set of key words,

471
00:28:06,934 --> 00:28:10,001
Which he'll use to create a profile of our killer.

472
00:28:10,034 --> 00:28:14,133
Sounds...complicated. Stay on it.

473
00:28:15,047 --> 00:28:17,133
Okay, we've been at this too long.

474
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:19,634
It's, uh, 1:00.

475
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:21,068
Let's break for lunch.

476
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,167
Are you all right?

477
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Huh? Yeah, i'm fine.

478
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:38,034
Anything you want to talk about?

479
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:41,567
No, not really.

480
00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:43,834
Well, if you change your mind -- It's my brother.

481
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,567
He was dating this chick --

482
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:48,567
Supersweet, a little doe-Eyed.

483
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,467
But, god, for him, fucking perfect,

484
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,167
And he just threw her away.

485
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,834
I'm just pissed at dexter, not to mention my boyfriend,

486
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,667
Who did absolutely nothing wrong.

487
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,167
But every time he opened his mouth last night,

488
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,901
I wanted to fucking slap him.

489
00:29:00,934 --> 00:29:02,400
You've been listening to chopin.

490
00:29:02,434 --> 00:29:04,901
Yeah, i downloaded a chopin --

491
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:08,534
Um, "nocturne number 2 in e flat major."

492
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:09,867
One of my favorites.

493
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:13,500
It, uh, can have this effect on people.

494
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:15,867
It can stir up some dust.

495
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:18,167
No shit.

496
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:29,500
<i>Listen, you -- You can heal yourself, sir.</i>

497
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,667
<i>Just -- You just need to talk to me.</i>

498
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:33,200
<i>Get it off you,</i>

499
00:29:33,233 --> 00:29:35,400
<i>Otherwise, it's gonna haunt you for the rest of your life.</i>

500
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:37,334
<i>Why don't you just listen to me?</i>

501
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:38,834
<i>I didn't do this.</i>

502
00:29:38,867 --> 00:29:42,567
<i>You -- You can't say it and make it true.</i>

503
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:44,133
<i>You have a conscience,</i>

504
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:47,100
<i>And it's really fucking with you right now.</i>

505
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:49,200
<i>I wish it were me. I wish i were dead.</i>

506
00:29:49,233 --> 00:29:50,500
<i>Yeah.</i>

507
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:52,634
Why are we questioning that guy?

508
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,300
He's a murder suspect.

509
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,034
No, he's not. He's innocent.

510
00:29:56,068 --> 00:29:59,133
What did you say?

511
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:00,634
My blood report backed his story.

512
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:02,367
Mr. Wilson found his stepdaughter dead,

513
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,567
Just like i told sergeant doakes at the crime scene.

514
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:07,334
You turned in the blood report? When?

515
00:30:07,367 --> 00:30:08,834
I don't know --

516
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:10,500
At some point before i went home last night.

517
00:30:10,534 --> 00:30:12,334
I put itight on the sergeant's desk,

518
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:14,200
Just like he asked.

519
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:15,601
The green folder.

520
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:21,068
Yeah, according to my findings,

521
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,467
The mist on the stepfather's shirt was exhaled

522
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,601
From the victim when he tried to revive her.

523
00:30:25,634 --> 00:30:27,834
The autopsy confirmed she had severe internal bleeding,

524
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,734
Due to the bludgeoning.

525
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:32,200
Yeah, but he could have beaten her first.

526
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:33,601
That's impossible.

527
00:30:33,634 --> 00:30:37,968
The crime-Scene photos show blood radiating outward

528
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,400
Around the victim's body.

529
00:30:39,434 --> 00:30:41,734
That kind of bludgeoning would have covered the real killer

530
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:44,034
In blood from head to toe.

531
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:46,467
Thanks.

532
00:30:50,534 --> 00:30:52,934
Mr. Wilson, you're free to go.

533
00:30:52,968 --> 00:30:55,068
What the hell? Lieutenant, this man is a killer.

534
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,567
This man has been through enough for one day.

535
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:00,701
There's an officer in the hallway.

536
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,767
He'll see that you get your personal belongings back

537
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:03,934
And take you home.

538
00:31:03,968 --> 00:31:06,867
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you so much.

539
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:16,367
What the hell are you doing?

540
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,634
Trying to save your career, james, if it isn't too late.

541
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,601
Did you even check the blood report?

542
00:31:20,634 --> 00:31:22,200
<i>I didn't get the blood report.</i>

543
00:31:22,233 --> 00:31:25,500
It's on your desk, and it exonerates your suspect.

544
00:31:25,534 --> 00:31:27,701
<i>We should be out there looking for the real killer.</i>

545
00:31:27,734 --> 00:31:29,767
Maria, that is not what he told me at --

546
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:33,400
That motherfucker.

547
00:31:34,795 --> 00:31:35,701
He's good.

548
00:31:35,734 --> 00:31:37,167
Who?

549
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,567
Morgan.

550
00:31:39,743 --> 00:31:41,034
He planned this whole thing.

551
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:42,968
Maria, that psychopath set me up.

552
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,567
Dexter again? You're blaming dexter for this?

553
00:31:45,601 --> 00:31:48,467
Do you have any idea how pathetic that sounds?

554
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,934
This is not about dexter!

555
00:31:49,968 --> 00:31:52,968
This is about the poor judgment you have been displaying

556
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:54,834
In this department for months now!

557
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,667
You want to work out?

558
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,700
No.

559
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,334
I wasn't talking about the gym.

560
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,334
You're sweet, but i'm really not in the mood.

561
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,700
So, what do you want to do?

562
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:23,301
Uh...

563
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,834
I think i want to break up.

564
00:32:31,468 --> 00:32:33,234
For real?

565
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:35,568
Yeah.

566
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,767
Is that okay?

567
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,434
No.

568
00:32:43,468 --> 00:32:45,267
No, it's not okay.

569
00:32:45,301 --> 00:32:46,733
Fuck, what did i do, deb?

570
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:49,067
Nothing. I swear to god.

571
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:53,900
You're...smoking hot and...fun

572
00:32:53,934 --> 00:32:57,568
And...soulful and...

573
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,633
Age-Appropriate.

574
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:00,700
And but what?

575
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:02,367
But...

576
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:07,568
Sometimes the truth speaks from a peaceful place.

577
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,201
It's taken me a long time to find that place,

578
00:33:10,234 --> 00:33:12,201
But i think i have,

579
00:33:12,234 --> 00:33:15,568
And it's telling me you're not the right one for me.

580
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,667
I'm so sorry.

581
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,667
You live in a nice neighborhood.

582
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,633
Yeah, i had no idea.

583
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:38,568
I'm usually passing by at 35 miles per hour.

584
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,534
I'm not a real big walker.

585
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:44,534
Everybody walks in london.

586
00:33:44,568 --> 00:33:48,101
Of course, they're usually walking to the pub.

587
00:33:48,134 --> 00:33:49,733
<i>How far are we going?</i>

588
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:55,568
Oh, you're a bit grumpy tonight.

589
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,900
What's wrong?

590
00:34:01,468 --> 00:34:05,534
Come on. Don't close up on me now.

591
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:06,867
No, i honestly don't know.

592
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,667
I mean, thanks to you, things are...

593
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,234
Actually looking up.

594
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:14,334
Some people at work have been...after me.

595
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:17,167
I think i have 'em under control.

596
00:34:17,201 --> 00:34:22,234
So, why the grouchiness?

597
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Is it because your sister thinks i'm a trollop?

598
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:30,767
It's not just...deb.

599
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,934
It's the suddenness of all of this --

600
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:37,900
Losing rita, the kids.

601
00:34:37,934 --> 00:34:42,334
They've been the only thing keeping me human

602
00:34:42,367 --> 00:34:45,633
For a long time.

603
00:34:49,301 --> 00:34:52,267
<i>Were they keeping you human, though,</i>

604
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:55,367
Or were they the ones making you feel like the monster

605
00:34:55,401 --> 00:34:57,267
That you were talking about?

606
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:03,534
Keep going.

607
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:06,667
Your friends and family have to accept you

608
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,334
For who you're evolving into now that you're clean.

609
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,167
Is that what i am --

610
00:35:14,201 --> 00:35:16,167
Clean?

611
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:21,700
'Cause i don't feel that way at all.

612
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:26,967
No, you certainly don't.

613
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:33,534
Mmm, god.

614
00:35:33,568 --> 00:35:36,900
I wish i could fuck you right now.

615
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:47,867
Whose house is this?

616
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,934
Couldn't tell you.

617
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:50,234
God.

618
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:53,367
He's a man of many talents.

619
00:36:00,134 --> 00:36:01,934
Ah!

620
00:36:22,234 --> 00:36:25,501
Look. I'm some old bit.

621
00:36:25,534 --> 00:36:28,733
Better not press our luck. We should go.

622
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:35,034
Hello?

623
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,067
Cody: hi, dexter.

624
00:36:37,101 --> 00:36:38,934
Cody?

625
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:42,667
Can you come to my school tomorrow?

626
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,067
What's at your school, buddy?

627
00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:47,434
I'm doing my cultural report.

628
00:36:49,067 --> 00:36:51,667
Saudi arabia.

629
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,600
Can you watch me? I'm kind of scared.

630
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:56,800
Gail: cody, what are you doing?

631
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,401
Who is this?

632
00:37:01,434 --> 00:37:03,534
Dexter.

633
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,134
Hello?

634
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,800
Who was that?

635
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,334
Rita's son.

636
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:22,267
He wants me to come see him at school tomorrow.

637
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:24,633
Oh, poor kid.

638
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:27,700
He doesn't understand that you've gone.

639
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:32,067
I think i'll go.

640
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:40,267
Whatever you think's best.

641
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,434
Hey, guys!

642
00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:54,067
I'm home!

643
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:57,967
Hello?

644
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,167
They're in bed.

645
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:01,134
Why so early?

646
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:03,633
Cody is being punished for sneaking away

647
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:06,034
To make a phone call without permission.

648
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:08,967
Astor joined him in a misguided show of support.

649
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,468
Well, who was cody calling?

650
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:12,667
Dexter.

651
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,600
The boy was trying to invite him to his school.

652
00:38:15,633 --> 00:38:17,367
Can you imagine? Oh.

653
00:38:18,967 --> 00:38:20,834
Mom, we need to have a talk.

654
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:23,334
I made a phone call of my own today.

655
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,468
I spoke with aunt cecilia.

656
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:30,101
She told me the school district fired you almost a year ago.

657
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:36,201
We had philosophical differences.

658
00:38:36,234 --> 00:38:39,000
The educational system is falling apart.

659
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:42,700
School should be life itself, not a preparation for living.

660
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:46,000
Do you know that they give trophies to every child now

661
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:47,534
Whether they win or lose?

662
00:38:47,568 --> 00:38:48,934
Yeah, i finally get it.

663
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:52,667
It took me a few decades, but it's not just me --

664
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,600
Nobody can deal with you.

665
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:57,800
You don't leave room for anybody else to exist.

666
00:38:57,834 --> 00:39:00,767
It's not my fault that so many people are willing

667
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,301
To settle for mediocrity.

668
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:05,633
Just look at you -- First paul, then dexter.

669
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:08,101
Rita, you lack even common sense,

670
00:39:08,134 --> 00:39:11,900
And now you're passing that torch of ordinary character

671
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:14,034
On to your children.

672
00:39:14,067 --> 00:39:15,600
Shut the fuck up.

673
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,800
Nobody talks about my kids that way.

674
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:22,167
Thatagirl.

675
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:25,167
<i>That's what i've been waiting to see.</i>

676
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:27,067
Yeah! I'm done with you.

677
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:28,501
No, you're not.

678
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:31,201
But you go -- You give me hell.

679
00:39:31,234 --> 00:39:32,334
No.

680
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:34,468
<i>No, i won't do that.</i>

681
00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:37,367
I won't let you turn me into...you.

682
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:39,733
Rita -- Here's what's gonna happen --

683
00:39:39,767 --> 00:39:41,201
First thing in the morning,

684
00:39:41,234 --> 00:39:43,167
You're gonna pack up and go home.

685
00:39:43,201 --> 00:39:46,101
You'll come and visit us for birthdays and holidays,

686
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,867
But you're not gonna live with us anymore.

687
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:52,568
Well...

688
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:57,568
...if that's what i have to sacrifice

689
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,867
To get you on your feet...

690
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:14,600
"Kill one man, and you're a murderer.

691
00:40:14,633 --> 00:40:16,234
"Kill thousands, a conqueror.

692
00:40:16,267 --> 00:40:18,267
Kill them all, and you're a god."

693
00:40:18,301 --> 00:40:20,067
Does it sound to you like our guy

694
00:40:20,101 --> 00:40:22,067
Has a narcissistic personality disorder,

695
00:40:22,101 --> 00:40:23,834
A classic god complex?

696
00:40:23,867 --> 00:40:25,867
I think you're onto something, angel.

697
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,167
<i>To tell you the truth,</i>

698
00:40:27,201 --> 00:40:29,568
<i>I don't know what my alter ego had in mind</i>

699
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,967
<i>When he wrote that crap.</i>

700
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,009
<i>I just pulled from various blogs on the internet,</i>

701
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:36,501
<i>Mixed and matched -- Presto manifesto.</i>

702
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:45,334
You finally decided to fight back.

703
00:40:46,633 --> 00:40:49,468
I been waiting.

704
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:52,468
Hope you don't expect me to comment on that

705
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:55,067
So you can record it on your hidden tape recorder.

706
00:40:55,101 --> 00:40:56,501
I wasn't born yesterday.

707
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:58,733
You might have been, for all i know.

708
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:01,900
Your past is a bigger mystery than fucking jimmy hoffa.

709
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:05,934
I tried every avenue, legal and otherwise,

710
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:07,700
But there ain't no paper trail

711
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:10,800
On the early years of dexter morgan.

712
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,568
I guess there's no recorder running, after all.

713
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,568
No, man.

714
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,934
Unlike you, i do everything out in the open.

715
00:41:23,234 --> 00:41:24,867
Well, in that case, sergeant,

716
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,934
Let me put this in the open for you.

717
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:31,201
No matter what you try, no matter when,

718
00:41:31,234 --> 00:41:33,167
No matter how hard you work,

719
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:37,101
I'll always be a step ahead of you for one simple reason.

720
00:41:37,134 --> 00:41:40,034
And what's that?

721
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:41,900
I own you.

722
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:43,568
Aah!

723
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,700
Aah! Fuck!

724
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:02,367
Get him off of me! Get off me!

725
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:06,967
Why are you doing this?!

726
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,434
Stop!

727
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:20,067
I want your gun, your badge, and your police i.D.

728
00:42:20,101 --> 00:42:22,367
I want your access card, too --

729
00:42:22,401 --> 00:42:23,667
Now!

730
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,167
Type a statement that sergeant doakes

731
00:42:26,201 --> 00:42:27,900
Is on administrative leave,

732
00:42:27,934 --> 00:42:31,434
Pending an internal affairs investigation.

733
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:35,501
You two, get him out of here.

734
00:42:37,234 --> 00:42:38,534
Thanks.

735
00:42:48,101 --> 00:42:49,934
What the hell happened?

736
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:53,501
I don't know. He just...jumped me.

737
00:42:57,101 --> 00:43:00,000
That guy's always had it out for me.

738
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:11,867
Lundy: thanks for meeting with me, don.

739
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,967
Don: well, i don't know what the point is.

740
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,767
The district court injunction hearing starts in three hours.

741
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,600
Which everyone here knows we're going to lose.

742
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:22,900
Don't look so shocked. We always lose these things.

743
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,934
You bastards and your free speech.

744
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:28,767
My boss never lets me say anything.

745
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,468
I'll tell you what --

746
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:33,067
I will agree to dropping the injunction,

747
00:43:33,101 --> 00:43:36,101
Which will save us days of courtroom arguments

748
00:43:36,134 --> 00:43:38,000
And a boatload of legal fees,

749
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:41,834
If we can agree on some simple ground rules

750
00:43:41,867 --> 00:43:43,767
On how you publish that document.

751
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,000
"Ground rules."

752
00:43:45,034 --> 00:43:46,600
We're not gonna have any ground rules.

753
00:43:46,633 --> 00:43:50,101
My only goal here is to avoid compromising an investigation

754
00:43:50,134 --> 00:43:52,600
Of a mass murderer...

755
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:55,767
Who could hurt a lot more people.

756
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,834
Give me just a second, will you, frank?

757
00:44:06,834 --> 00:44:08,834
I can't believe you got those assholes

758
00:44:08,867 --> 00:44:11,568
To publish the manifesto without the victims' names

759
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,534
And as a page-3 story.

760
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:15,800
No sense hyping it.

761
00:44:15,834 --> 00:44:18,501
It might just inspire the killer to greater heights.

762
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:19,900
Wait.

763
00:44:19,934 --> 00:44:21,633
It's quiet here...

764
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:23,934
Peaceful.

765
00:44:23,967 --> 00:44:25,867
It's a good spot.

766
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,834
For what?

767
00:44:27,867 --> 00:44:29,568
It's 1:00.

768
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:34,401
So it is.

769
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,301
I brought my own sandwich.

770
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,434
I thought you didn't like the quiet, morgan.

771
00:44:46,468 --> 00:44:47,900
I didn't.

772
00:44:47,934 --> 00:44:49,334
I don't.

773
00:44:51,568 --> 00:44:54,700
When i'm alone and it's quiet, i get scared...

774
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,733
Shitless,

775
00:44:56,767 --> 00:45:01,733
Like i start hearing what's really going on inside.

776
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:04,201
I see.

777
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,834
So if it's all the same to you,

778
00:45:05,867 --> 00:45:08,767
Maybe i can just practice when you're around.

779
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,568
Okay.

780
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,633
'Cause when you're around,

781
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:16,867
I kind of feel like i can deal with anything, you know?

782
00:45:18,568 --> 00:45:21,834
Like what happened to me --

783
00:45:22,434 --> 00:45:25,534
I don't have to run from it.

784
00:45:25,568 --> 00:45:29,234
I don't have to jump into bed with some guy and hide there.

785
00:45:32,867 --> 00:45:34,867
You give me strength.

786
00:45:42,767 --> 00:45:45,534
I'm kind of opening up here.

787
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:49,434
What do you want me to say?

788
00:45:49,468 --> 00:45:52,167
I don't know.

789
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:56,534
You're the fucking zen master. Figure it out.

790
00:45:59,967 --> 00:46:02,234
Morgan...

791
00:46:02,267 --> 00:46:04,067
I've got plaque in my arteries.

792
00:46:04,101 --> 00:46:06,101
I know the lyrics to elevator music.

793
00:46:06,134 --> 00:46:08,167
My hair isn't getting any thicker.

794
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:47,367
You're gonna do great up there.

795
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:49,167
You just have to remember something --

796
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:50,967
They're more frightened than you are.

797
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,201
No, they're not.

798
00:46:52,234 --> 00:46:53,600
Are so.

799
00:46:53,633 --> 00:46:55,667
You're gonna be staring at them the whole time.

800
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,568
If one of those unsuspecting moms or dads

801
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,934
Does something embarrassing while you're up on stage...

802
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:00,934
Like pick their nose?

803
00:47:00,967 --> 00:47:02,633
...you're gonna be the one who sees it.

804
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:04,267
Yeah.

805
00:47:04,301 --> 00:47:05,301
Now that's power.

806
00:47:05,334 --> 00:47:08,267
Now go have fun.

807
00:47:09,834 --> 00:47:12,834
Dexter, over here. We saved you a seat.

808
00:47:12,867 --> 00:47:14,267
Thanks, guys.

809
00:47:19,534 --> 00:47:24,134
There you go -- $18,000.

810
00:47:24,167 --> 00:47:26,134
I'll send a truck for the piece tomorrow.

811
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:27,967
I am telling you, lila,

812
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,767
This is going to create a critical mass for you.

813
00:47:33,401 --> 00:47:35,534
Masuka: according to the psycholinguistic analysis

814
00:47:35,568 --> 00:47:37,067
Of the manifesto,

815
00:47:37,101 --> 00:47:41,034
Our killer is a white male in his 50s.

816
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,267
What else?

817
00:47:42,301 --> 00:47:45,468
Uh, the killer has no girlfriends

818
00:47:45,501 --> 00:47:47,334
And considers himself a good catholic.

819
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:48,633
Batista: hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

820
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:50,767
How can you tell all that by putting words in a computer?

821
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,733
I don't know, dude. It's science.

822
00:47:52,767 --> 00:47:54,101
How 'bout common sense?

823
00:47:54,134 --> 00:47:56,900
I think the guy that we're looking for is pissed off at god,

824
00:47:56,934 --> 00:47:58,501
And that's why he kills people.

825
00:47:58,534 --> 00:48:01,301
Really? I actually found him very politically motivated.

826
00:48:01,334 --> 00:48:03,167
Yeah, like a modern-Day revolutionary.

827
00:48:03,201 --> 00:48:06,134
Which would suggest that he's killing for social change.

828
00:48:13,733 --> 00:48:15,534
This is what he wants.

829
00:48:15,568 --> 00:48:16,700
What's that?

830
00:48:16,733 --> 00:48:19,267
Confusion, chaos --

831
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:22,201
It's what the killer wants.

832
00:48:22,234 --> 00:48:24,600
He's always been an intensely private figure,

833
00:48:24,633 --> 00:48:26,534
Dispatching victims silently.

834
00:48:26,568 --> 00:48:29,700
Now he's suddenly a media whore? It doesn't make sense.

835
00:48:29,733 --> 00:48:31,633
He's creating a clusterfuck.

836
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:33,600
Very good, officer morgan.

837
00:48:33,633 --> 00:48:35,700
The killer's making us chase our tails.

838
00:48:35,733 --> 00:48:37,334
You know what that means?

839
00:48:55,434 --> 00:48:56,967
He knows how we work.

840
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Look how he hits every major theme --

841
00:48:59,034 --> 00:49:01,301
Political, environmental, religious.

842
00:49:01,334 --> 00:49:05,434
In one section, he manages to weave together julius caesar,

843
00:49:05,468 --> 00:49:08,201
Berlin, germany, the pittsburgh steelers, and gandhi.

844
00:49:08,234 --> 00:49:09,633
It's scattershot.

845
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:12,134
He knew that this would send us scurrying

846
00:49:12,167 --> 00:49:13,600
Like squirrels for nuts.

847
00:49:13,633 --> 00:49:17,134
Yeah, but to suggest that he might be one of us --

848
00:49:17,167 --> 00:49:19,067
How can you be sure?

849
00:49:23,034 --> 00:49:26,501
Hi, i'm cody, and i researched saudi arabia

850
00:49:26,534 --> 00:49:28,468
For my cultural report.

851
00:49:28,501 --> 00:49:29,934
My board is covered in sand

852
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:33,101
Because saudi arabia is one big desert.

853
00:49:33,134 --> 00:49:38,234
As you can see, i used coffee beans to write "saudi arabia."

854
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:40,834
Arabic coffee is very famous.

855
00:49:40,867 --> 00:49:42,667
<i>I'm a little confused.</i>

856
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,834
<i>Lila is the one showing me how to take control,</i>

857
00:49:45,867 --> 00:49:49,301
<i>Stop killing, get my life clean.</i>

858
00:49:49,334 --> 00:49:52,134
<i>But this is the first time since i went into recovery</i>

859
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:55,034
<i>That i actually feel clean.</i>

860
00:49:55,067 --> 00:49:57,767
The children in saudi arabia are just like us,

861
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,800
Because they...

862
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:25,633
This is the saudi arabian flag.

863
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,800
The arabic letters mean "there is no god except allah."

864
00:50:43,633 --> 00:50:46,733
Do you know how tough it is for a woman in saudi arabia?

865
00:50:46,767 --> 00:50:49,667
They can't drive or have powerful jobs.

866
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,867
Or get this -- They can't even go to the movies

867
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,301
Without men's permission.

868
00:50:59,334 --> 00:51:03,367
After they turn 12, they have to wear long black sleeves,

869
00:51:03,401 --> 00:51:07,568
And they can't hardly even talk to men until they get married.

870
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,234
The new king, abdullah,

871
00:51:17,267 --> 00:51:19,501
Is trying to change some old bad rules,

872
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,301
So women can do more things...

873
00:51:24,534 --> 00:51:26,534
Thank you very much for listening.

874
00:51:26,568 --> 00:51:29,534
Or, as they say in arabic, "shokran."

875
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:57,234
I can't believe how calm you were up there.

876
00:51:57,267 --> 00:51:59,767
Yeah, you were like a professional talker.

877
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,468
You were pretty good.

878
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:05,667
Can dexter come for ice cream with us?

879
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,600
Can he, mom, please?

880
00:52:07,633 --> 00:52:11,067
Uh...sure, dexter can join us.

881
00:52:11,101 --> 00:52:12,201
I wouldn't miss it.

882
00:52:12,234 --> 00:52:14,201
Maybe they'll have some delicious saudi flavors,

883
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:15,667
Like sand or oil.

884
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:19,667
Hang on a sec, guys.

885
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,401
Hello.

886
00:52:24,367 --> 00:52:25,967
Are you hurt?

887
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,468
O-Okay, okay. I'm coming now.

888
00:52:32,134 --> 00:52:33,501
I know. Me too.

889
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:41,067
Come on, kids. Dexter won't be joining us.

890
00:52:41,101 --> 00:52:42,367
Rita, it's an emergency.

891
00:52:42,401 --> 00:52:44,568
Look, i'm so sorry, you guys.

892
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,867
I'm gonna make it up to you,

893
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,600
But i got to help a friend who's in trouble.

894
00:52:47,633 --> 00:52:49,134
There was a fire at her place.

895
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,401
I'm so sorry.

896
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:53,568
Hey, let's go.

897
00:53:16,733 --> 00:53:18,201
Dexter.

898
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:22,468
What happened?

899
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:27,667
I was working on my piece with the blowtorch,

900
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,667
And it just caught fire. I was so scared.

901
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,000
Oh, i guess so.

902
00:53:37,334 --> 00:53:39,934
Promise me that you won't leave me,

903
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,367
That you won't go anywhere.

904
00:53:42,401 --> 00:53:44,834
I'm not going anywhere.

905
00:53:55,967 --> 00:53:58,434
Hey, you got your light fixed.

906
00:54:05,352 --> 00:54:09,899
