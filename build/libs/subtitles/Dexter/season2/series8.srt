Dexter

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Season 2

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Episode 8

4
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,030
Previously on "Dexter"

5
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,600
My mother -- she was murdered when I was a boy.

6
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,300
I was there. I saw it.

7
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,360
There were three men arrested for those murders.

8
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,660
One's deceased,one's doing life without possibility,

9
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,830
and that's the only one that's still an open case --

10
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,200
santos jiminez.

11
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,130
1972!

12
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,600
Did you have to saw her into little pieces?

13
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,000
Did you have to leave two little boys soaking in a pool

14
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,430
of their mother's blood?

15
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't care what you did. It's okay.

16
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,500
Who the fuck are you?

17
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,130
Oh,pardon my tits.

18
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,230
How could you do this to rita,not to mention her kids?

19
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,930
Hey,rita broke up with me,okay?

20
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,300
'Cause when you're around,

21
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,100
I kind of feel like I can deal with anything,you know?

22
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,730
Morgan...

23
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,430
Your past is a bigger mystery than fucking jimmy hoffa.

24
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,560
It's time to make doakes go away.

25
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,060
Sergeant doakes is on administrative leave

26
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,930
pending an internal affairs investigation.

27
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,800
The killer's making us chase our tails.

28
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,000
You know what that means?

29
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,030
That he might be one of us?

30
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,960
I was working on my piece,and it just caught fire.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,130
I was so scared.

32
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,600
Promise me that you won't leave me,

33
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,200
that you won't go anywhere.

34
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,930
I'm not going anywhere.

35
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,230
Morning comes

36
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,500
I can't believe he said it.

37
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,100
Even for masuka,it was too much.

38
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,660
And batista didn't do anything.

39
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,560
Talk about lame -- he fucking sat there.

40
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,900
You know how much I wanted to...

41
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,130
Is that the sports section?

42
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,460
I used to enjoy quiet mornings,

43
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,530
but ever since the fire at lila's loft,

44
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,660
she's been crashing here a bit too often.

45
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,760
Is that my shirt?

46
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,760
I don't know, I thought it was Dexter's.

47
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,200
It's not.

48
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,030
Uh,no,it's okay. Just...Keep it.

49
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,000
And so now I share the kitchen with a cobra and a mongoose.

50
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,930
Did somebody drink all the coffee again?

51
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,830
No. Somebody didn't drink all the coffee.

52
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,330
I had a cup,and Dexter had a cup,

53
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,160
and it just kind of went like that

54
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,530
until the pot was empty.

55
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,960
Deb,please. What?

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,930
Someone didn't drink all the coffee. Stupid question.

57
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,600
Why are you sticking up for her,anyway?

58
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,130
I'm just trying to keep the peace.

59
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,900
Maybe we should stay at your place tonight.

60
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,960
Has the fire damage been repaired yet?

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,430
The insurance company is still dicking me around.

62
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,600
Won't give me a check.

63
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,300
Don't worry about it. I'll be moving out soon.

64
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,730
Stop leeching off your brother? Whatever for?

65
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,030
Again,dex,thanks for sticking up for me.

66
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,200
I am switzerland.

67
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,530
Yeah,and I'm out of here.

68
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,260
What's this?

69
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,600
It's the dragon zombie.

70
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,100
Cody likes to hide things in my bag.

71
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,030
He's trying to control you.

72
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,860
By hiding toys in your bag,

73
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,930
you have no choice but to return them to him.

74
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,530
He's 7. He seldom has thoughts more complicated

75
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,960
than the desire for candy.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,260
I'll see you at your loft tonight.

77
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,430
Oh,honey -- honey,no.

78
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,660
No.

79
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,960
You said we could make breakfast.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,960
I meant cereal,baby.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,130
I don't want cereal.

82
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,360
I guess I should give rita back her key.

83
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,730
Cody,no. No,let mommy get the d--

84
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,730
it's Dexter!

85
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,130
He brought doughnuts!

86
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,700
I did. I also brought... A dragon zombie!

87
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,500
I knew you'd find it!

88
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,560
Hope it's okay I'm here.

89
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,660
Could you watch them while I finish getting ready?

90
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,760
Astor still has homework.

91
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,660
Thank you,Dexter.

92
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,730
Meet me at the car.

93
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,160
Good thing I dropped by.

94
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,860
Don't ever do it again.

95
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,930
I'm sorry?

96
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,660
It's too hard on the kids,and it's too hard on me.

97
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,530
It's paul all over again.

98
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,100
Please,Dexter,just stay away.

99
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,500
You'll notice we have some new faces here.

100
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,830
Please make them feel welcome.

101
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,560
Our immediate task is to re-examine every criminal case

102
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,260
involving our 18 victims.

103
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,800
Where would you like us to start?

104
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,430
By answering every question

105
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,860
as honestly and with as much detail as you can.

106
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,960
Excuse me,sir. Answering questions?

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,360
That is correct.

108
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,130
I can hardly expect you to investigate your own cases.

109
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,260
What are you saying? Are we under investigation?

110
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,060
We are now operating under the assumption

111
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,430
that our killer is somehow connected to law enforcement.

112
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,360
Whether he be a file clerk,a dispatch officer,

113
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,560
park ranger... Or a police officer.

114
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,530
Or a police officer.

115
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,030
Is that why you brought in all these suits?

116
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,400
Special agents.

117
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,000
Sir,you risk alienating every cop on the task force

118
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,460
if you do this.

119
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,230
We go where the chase leads us...

120
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,160
Even if it gets messy.

121
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,430
It's insulting.

122
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,500
We're just as capable as they are

123
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,400
of looking into our own cases.

124
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,760
Who wears a wool suit in the middle of summer in miami?

125
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,160
Nazis -- that's who. It's all about intimidation.

126
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,560
And the idea that one of us could be the killer?

127
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,760
It's complete bullshit.

128
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,900
What do you mean? "Us" who?

129
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,730
Lundy has his feds investigating all of our cases

130
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,800
that are tied to the bay harbor victims.

131
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,260
That's good here.

132
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,330
Look,we got to stand tough here.

133
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,060
We got to make it clear to them

134
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,400
that we're not gonna be

135
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,430
their little "yes,sir,no,sir" lapdogs.

136
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,130
Gentlemen.

137
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,430
Morgan,I'd like to go over some of your cases tomorrow.

138
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,930
Got them all listed right there.

139
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,760
It would be helpful if you could gather up

140
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,660
any notes you may have taken.

141
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,100
Happy to help.

142
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,930
Way to stand tough,Dexter.

143
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,060
Sorry.

144
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,900
That's exactly how hitler walked.

145
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,660
It seems my manifesto

146
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,630
unintentionally helped lundy narrow his focus.

147
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,430
That's what I get for trying to emulate lila

148
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,930
and take the offensive.

149
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,530
I've always worked best in the shadows,

150
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,760
and that's where I have to stay.

151
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,200
Lundy's really pissing people off.

152
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,930
He's got his whole crew looking through every case

153
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,360
involving any of the bay harbor victims.

154
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,960
He sounds desperate.

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,030
You know you're gonna be called in.

156
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,600
I'll be curious to see if I show up.

157
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,400
Okay,james,you need to be a little careful here.

158
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,130
If you want to keep your job,you got to cooperate.

159
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,900
Being on suspension does not exclude you from this.

160
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,860
And who was it that suspended me again?

161
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,260
Oh,shit. That was you.

162
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,200
Please,don't act like you didn't deserve it.

163
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,300
Your case is coming up for review in a week.

164
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,900
If you want to keep your job --

165
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,360
you keep saying that,maria.

166
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,460
What makes you think I want to keep my job?

167
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,860
Are you just talking here,

168
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,830
or is this something that you've seriously considered?

169
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,330
Well,you and I both know

170
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,030
that I have gone as high as I can over there.

171
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,760
Maybe it's time to move on.

172
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,500
Well,what would you do?

173
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,600
I don't know. My father was a butcher.

174
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,630
Maybe I'll open up my own butcher shop.

175
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,200
Yeah, I can just see you putting on an apron every morning.

176
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,400
Look, I have a friend.

177
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,230
He's the head of personnel at stillwater security.

178
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,600
Government contractors?

179
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,100
They're always looking for people like you.

180
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,630
It's a dangerous world out there.

181
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,800
They pay a lot of money to make it safe.

182
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,460
Yeah,you got that right.

183
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,600
All right. Set it up. I'll meet with your guy.

184
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,460
Officer morgan. Debra.

185
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,030
Yes?

186
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,230
I picked the rodrigo case for you to look into --

187
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,000
small-time dope dealer.

188
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,260
Arrested for murder,ended up walking free,

189
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,160
then disappeared off the face of the earth

190
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,900
until his body was found in a garbage bag in the ocean.

191
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,130
Not exciting enough for you?

192
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,600
Well,it's just...I'm homicide.

193
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,530
I mean, I thought you didn't want us

194
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,230
checking into our own cases.

195
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,600
You're new to homicide.

196
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,800
At the time of this case,you were still in vice.

197
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,600
No conflict there.

198
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,860
Well,I'm flattered you want me in on this,but...

199
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,100
Batista and doakes were lead here.

200
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,600
I feel kind of weird about investigating my own colleagues.

201
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,400
Weird. Gosh.

202
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,900
I'd hate for you to feel weird.

203
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,300
You know what I mean.

204
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,860
Would you have dinner with me tomorrow night?

205
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,100
Or would that make you feel weird?

206
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,530
I'd love to have dinner with you.

207
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,400
Good.

208
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,900
I'll take you to the best restaurant in miami.

209
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,530
Wow. Great.

210
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,160
I like the smell. Don't you?

211
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,360
Like something exciting happened here.

212
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,800
It's like when a piece of bread gets stuck in the toaster.

213
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,730
You like to pretend there's no poetry in you.

214
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,060
So,what's the problem with the insurance company?

215
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,700
Why aren't they paying?

216
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,030
It's ridiculous.

217
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,030
They think the fire is of suspicious origin,

218
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,960
and they need to finish their investigation.

219
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,360
What do they mean,"suspicious"?

220
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,030
Are they saying you started the fire on purpose?

221
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,360
Who knows what they're saying?

222
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,900
You know insurance companies --

223
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,760
anything to keep from paying out.

224
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,760
Yeah,especially when a fire  has multiple points of origin.

225
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,200
So,you never told me.

226
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,130
How did it go at rita's this morning?

227
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,030
Uh,you know, I just returned cody's toy,

228
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,900
and that was it.

229
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,360
No quickie on the kitchen table?

230
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,600
Rita doesn't have a kitchen table.

231
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,730
Oh,clever way of not answering the question.

232
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,260
It was...

233
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,900
Awkward,actually.

234
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,460
Always is.

235
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,630
You can't go back. You know that.

236
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,700
I'm not trying to go anywhere.

237
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,930
Well,the bed's all ready.

238
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,830
Uh, I can't.

239
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,000
And why would that be?

240
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,300
I have too much work to do.

241
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,100
I have all these case files I have to go over for tomorrow.

242
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,300
You didn't bring any work with you?

243
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,960
Home. I need to...Work at home.

244
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,360
Okay.

245
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,630
Goodbye,then.

246
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,430
So,I'll see you tomorrow?

247
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,760
Whatever.

248
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,200
Is it possible she started  that fire on purpose?

249
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,760
I can't imagine why.

250
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,600
What I do know is that I can't  take any risks right now.

251
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,900
Hi,you wanted to --

252
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,160
morgan,come in.

253
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,760
Can I offer you some tea?

254
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,500
Uh,no,thank you. I'm...

255
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,230
And he pours it anyway.

256
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,360
He's trying to throw me  off balance,

257
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,430
show that I don't have  the power to say no to him.

258
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,560
How about some sesame crackers to go with that?

259
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,060
So I'll say yes to everything.

260
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,200
I'd love some.

261
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,300
Oh. Sorry. Guess I ate them all.

262
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,160
Asshole.

263
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,300
So,you worked firsthand on,

264
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,000
what,four of the cases

265
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,700
related to the bay harbor investigation?

266
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,660
I believe so.

267
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,400
Your reports were a real pleasure to read.

268
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,800
Concise,meticulous. I appreciate that.

269
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,600
Good. Thank you.

270
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,230
Does your sister prefer meat or fish?

271
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,030
Debra?

272
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,330
You have more than one?

273
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,430
Sister?

274
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,530
Uh,no. Just deb.

275
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,030
Or is she more of a salad kind of person?

276
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,030
She's definitely a carnivore.

277
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,960
Good.

278
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,330
Good.

279
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,060
So...The rodrigo case.

280
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,760
Let's talk about that one.

281
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,200
Okay.

282
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,960
Kind of blew it,didn't you?

283
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,730
I'm sorry?

284
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,230
Anthony rodrigo --

285
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,730
crack dealer with an apparent habit

286
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,100
of killing people who got in his way.

287
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:39,500
I believe this was -- yes -- doakes' and batista's case.

288
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,160
They finally tied rodrigo to one of his victims,

289
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,100
built a solid manslaughter case,

290
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,860
would have got him off the street for a few years.

291
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:51,100
But the case largely rested on the bloodwork that you did.

292
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,030
Bloodwork that in the course of the trial

293
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,130
was proven to be,well...Wrong.

294
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,860
So,you -- one of the most cautious

295
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,500
and precise forensic specialists

296
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,200
I have had the pleasure to work with --

297
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,760
you performed bloodwork

298
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,800
that directly led to rodrigo walking free.

299
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:17,060
I asked myself,"how the hell did that happen?"

300
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,800
And did you answer,"Dexter  blew the case on purpose

301
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,360
"so that he could get rodrigo  off the streets for good

302
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,400
with a cordless reciprocating saw"?

303
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,960
I'm sorry. You've caught me off-guard here.

304
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,800
Sloppy bloodwork.

305
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,260
Look,this wasn't my idea.

306
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,800
Could have said no.

307
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,360
Come on,angel,we have a job to do.

308
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,030
Since when is it my job to try and prove

309
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,230
to a fellow police officer that I'm not a serial killer?

310
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,700
You know that's not what this is about.

311
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,800
What is this about?

312
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,260
It's about trying to find someone

313
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,600
who had motive and opportunity to kill all 18 of our victims.

314
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,960
Um,no way it's anybody in our department.

315
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,830
Then help me prove it.

316
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,060
Go through the rodrigo case with me.

317
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,560
Look,it is not just you.

318
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,660
Laguerta's cooperating on her old cases.

319
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,630
Even matthews is coming in.

320
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,860
The rodrigo file.

321
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,600
You just happen to have it with you.

322
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,430
I'm a reasonable man.

323
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,560
You know how it is.

324
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,030
The defense attorneys bring in their so-called blood experts

325
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,760
to counter everything I say.

326
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,700
I'm familiar with the process.

327
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,560
I understand how this may look like sloppy bloodwork

329
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,730
that's what rodrigo's defense convinced the jury of.

330
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,530
But as you can see,

331
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,260
the low-velocity blood drops clearly point in the direction

332
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,160
opposite to that in which we know rodrigo to have fled,

333
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,860
which makes it impossible --

334
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,530
except those low-velocity drops

335
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,330
were revealed to actually be 90-degree passive drops

336
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,530
that were given tails

337
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,000
due to the angle of the floor.

338
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,400
Perhaps,but if you then examine the blood trail --

339
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,200
which we know isn't a blood trail,

340
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,060
but projected blood.

341
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,930
You're not winning me over here,morgan.

342
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,300
The truth?

343
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,200
By all means.

344
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,760
I was overworked.

345
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,100
I was carrying half a dozen cases at once.

346
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,300
It was a heat wave -- means a spike in...Homicides.

347
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,000
This one got pushed aside.

348
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,700
I didn't write up my summary until an hour before the trial.

349
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,800
I obviously overlooked a few things.

350
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,800
A murderer walked free

351
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,630
because you were overworked?

352
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,460
Yes.

353
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,960
Who's this guy? Lenny asher.

354
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Lenny? He's a nutjob...

355
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,930
But it says he lived next door to rodrigo,

356
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,330
filed all kinds of complaints.

357
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,800
But he filed complaints about everybody.

358
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,830
He'd just sit at his window all day

359
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,260
and call us every time he saw someone move.

360
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,860
He called us once to say there was something weird

361
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,000
about the clouds.

362
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,760
Still no harm talking to him,right?

363
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,930
Lenny asher?

364
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,460
Who the hell are you?

365
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,900
Detective batista. This is officer morgan.

366
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,000
We're with the miami metro homicide.

367
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,160
Can we come in?

368
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,430
Who's dead?

369
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,830
Anthony rodrigo.

370
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,960
I know. They found him in the ocean.

371
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,560
I hope a whale ate him and shat him out,

372
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,830
and then ate him again.

373
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,460
You weren't too close to him,were you?

374
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,330
He was scum!

375
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Yeah,you made numerous calls about him

376
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,330
when he used to live here.

377
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,060
He was a drug dealer.

378
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,100
He played loud music,urinated on my lilies.

379
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,600
You actually saw that?

380
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,830
They were dead. That's all I needed to know.

381
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,930
Any thoughts as to who might have killed him?

382
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,900
How the hell should I know?

383
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:44,860
Look at that joker parked right in front of the fire hydrant.

384
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,830
I got his license plate,though.

385
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,160
Um... That would be our car.

386
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,130
You,uh,take a lot of notes?

387
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,530
Anything hinky happens outside this window,

388
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,530
I make a note on it.

389
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,060
How long you been doing that?

390
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,430
Since someone stuck a nail in my tire --

391
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,760
march 1998.

392
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,330
Rodrigo was last seen alive the day after his trial --

393
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,900
april 16,2002.

394
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,630
Think you might have taken any notes that day?

395
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,600
If something happened, I did.

396
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,730
You still have those notes?

397
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,460
Here. 2002.

398
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,330
What kind of order did you put them in?

399
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,230
I told you -- 2002.

400
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,900
I have no idea if lundy  bought my excuse.

401
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,860
Either way,  it makes me a little anxious

402
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,060
to see my sister looking  through the rodrigo files --

403
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,400
looking for me.

404
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,100
Hey. Dex.

405
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,000
You're never gonna guess what I found.

406
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,760
What did you find?

407
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,560
An apartment.

408
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,700
Oh. Great.

409
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,930
One-bedroom near 78th and harding.

410
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,530
Wow. Big change.

411
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,600
Yeah,well,it's time,you know?

412
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,400
Well,good for you. When do you move?

413
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,200
As soon as possible,but not tonight.

414
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,660
I have a date.

415
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,060
I thought you broke up with gabriel.

416
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,030
No,it's...Someone new.

417
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,760
Lundy.

418
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,660
Lundy,special agent lundy?

419
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,060
He's at least 20 years older than me.

420
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,230
What do you care?

421
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,130
I don't.

422
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,860
I mean...

423
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,800
...I'm sure you wouldn't do anything like that.

424
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,130
What are you talking about? Do anything like what?

425
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,730
Like try to sleep your way to the top.

426
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,100
You douche.

427
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,860
That is so not true.

428
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,860
No,of course not.

429
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,830
I shouldn't have even said anything,

430
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,130
and I'm sure that thought

431
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,200
would never even occur to anyone else.

432
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,700
Double douche!

433
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,830
You are not allowed to talk about anyone I date

434
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,200
as long you're seeing little miss "pardon my tits."

435
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,460
I am sorry,dex,but she is gross...

436
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,500
And pale,and nobody is pale in miami.

437
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,900
She is obviously a vampire.

438
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:22,700
A gross english-titty vampire.

439
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,430
You just described the perfect woman.

440
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,860
Truth is I need to avoid  lila for now.

441
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,300
Harry taught me  that the key to survival

442
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,860
was staying one step ahead.

443
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,030
But lundy almost  trapped me today.

444
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,360
I can't be unprepared  like that again.

445
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,730
Hey,it's me.

446
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,760
Why aren't you here? I'm starving.

447
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,260
Oh, I thought you knew -- it's my bowling night.

448
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,130
Bowling? Really?

449
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,430
What,like fred flintstone?

450
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,730
I'm more in the barney rubble category.

451
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,800
How fun. I'd love to watch you bowl.

452
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,330
It's not really a spectator sport.

453
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,660
Oh,well,I'll close my eyes.

454
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,630
But it's sort of the guys' night out.

455
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,730
Come on,Dexter, I want to meet your friends.

456
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,760
Where is it? What time is it? Give me the address.

457
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,930
Starlight lanes. 1690 Michigan avenue.

458
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,300
7:00.

459
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:32,000
I guess I'm going bowling.

460
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,000
Go,Dexter!

461
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,860
He only got three pins down.

462
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,630
Yeah,well, I like to celebrate the little things in life.

463
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,560
Hey,if you like little things,I'm your man.

464
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,300
I mean,I'm not little everywhere.

465
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,160
Some places I'm just perfectly average.

466
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,360
You are perfectly adorable.

467
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,560
How come you got a hug and I got a pat on the nose?

468
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,660
'Cause you're like a retarded puppy.

469
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,160
Your ass does the cutest little thing when you bowl.

470
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,360
Oh,thank you.

471
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:20,360
If you guys will excuse me, I need to use the ladies' room.

472
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,460
She's pretty hot.

473
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,730
Yes. She is.

475
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,930
Very,uh...

476
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,660
Gray.

477
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,130
Yes,the bureau have always been known

478
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,930
for their fashion sense.

479
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,900
Honestly,all I care about is the kitchen.

480
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,530
You cook?

481
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,460
Like I said,best restaurant in miami.

482
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,160
Really? You're gonna cook for me.

483
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,160
Well,don't ever expect me to return the favor...

484
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,100
Unless you're a big fan of toast.

485
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,460
I would love to eat your toast.

486
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,760
Gosh,that sounded wrong.

487
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,300
So,what's for dinner?

488
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,160
Uh,steak florentine and grilled potatoes italian-style.

489
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,660
Fucking-a.

490
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,400
There's that mouth again.

491
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,830

493
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,530
And if we're gonna be together,you better get used to it.

494
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,030
Can't change who I am.

495
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,130
I'm crass and dirty,and...

496
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,400
I have a very filthy mind.

497
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,560
You're also pretty adorable.

498
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,960
I know.

499
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,730
Now start peeling potatoes.

500
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,260
I like a man that takes control.

501
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,230
Wash your hands first.

502
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,800
You're so turning me on.

503
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,200
You know,considering our age difference,

504
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,960
you're not too old to spank.

505
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,830
No,stop. Please.

506
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,560
I can't control myself.

507
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,530
Oh,my god!

508
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,300
You sure you don't want to grab a beer with us,Dexter?

509
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,360
Nah,thanks. I'm tired.

510
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:49,200
Mmm, I hoped you saved enough energy for me.

511
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,430
That doesn't exactly look like the look of love.

512
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,130
I'm sorry. I really am tired.

513
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,330
Dexter!

514
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,100
Help! Help,please!

515
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,930
Somebody please come!

516
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,730
God.

517
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,860
You okay?

518
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,530
Yeah,yeah.

519
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,600
Dexter,you're bleeding. It's not deep.

520
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,000
I mean,what the hell?

521
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,660
He tried to grab my watch.

522
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,600
It's stupid. I should have let him have it.

523
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,900
It was just -- it was reflex.

524
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,330
Yeah,yeah. I'm fine.

525
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
Jesus christ.

526
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,360
They sell anyone a gun in florida,won't they?

527
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,300
Yeah, I know. Scary,right?

528
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,800
Anyone get a license plate?

529
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,360
No,it was all too fast.

530
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,730
You want us to take you to a doctor? No.

531
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,430
Really,I'm fine.

532
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,100
I'll take care of him.

533
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:51,400
So,who was it?

534
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,900
Who?

535
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,300
That man. He wasn't trying to rob you.

536
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,430
He was trying to kill you.

537
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,600
Santos jiminez,the man who murdered my mother.

538
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,860
Oh,my god,Dexter.

539
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,500
He must have followed me to the bowling alley.

540
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,960
If you hadn't have seen him in time --

541
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,500
shh! I did see him. That's all that matters.

542
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,730
None of this scares you?

543
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,700
Nothing you could do,Dexter,would scare me.

544
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,000
I believe you.

545
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,000
Come here.

546
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,260
Whatever comes,

547
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,100
we'll get through this together.

548
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:49,960
I'm not leaving your side,Dexter.

549
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,360
I'm not leaving yours.

550
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,900
Really?

551
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,260
Why would you think that?

552
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,460
You've just been a bit distant lately.

553
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,600
I get that way when I'm stressed.

554
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,800
What are you stressed about?

555
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,230
Right now,nothing.

556
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,200
Do you think Dexter will come for breakfast tomorrow?

557
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:37,000
Oh,I-I don't think so,honey.

558
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,560
Well,maybe we should call him.

559
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,000
It's kind of late.

560
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,730
But Dexter stays up late.

561
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,660
She doesn't want to call him.

562
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,460
Why not?

563
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,730
Dexter and I broke up.

564
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,460
Why?

565
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,860
They don't like each other anymore.

566
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,960
Well,that's not true.

567
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,800
Does that mean he doesn't like us,either?

568
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,200
Oh,no. Of course he likes you.

569
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:15,760
It's just...It's hard when two people break up.

570
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,400
It makes them sad to see each other.

571
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,900
I don't think Dexter's gonna be coming for breakfast

572
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,560
for a while.

573
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,830
Sorry.

574
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,260
Lila may be the right woman for me

575
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,030
but she's wrong about one thing

576
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,630
recovery simply isn't an option

577
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,960
when I let my guard down,

578
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,830
I open myself up for attack or capture

579
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,030
I need to embrace who I am, who I have always been.

580
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,060
I need to kill the man who murdered my mother.

581
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,730
I'd almost forgotten this feeling --

582
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,830
driving toward a kill,all my senses sharpened.

583
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,500
It's like I have been living underwater,

584
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,800
holding my breath,and now I can finally breathe.

585
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,500
So how come it's so suffocating in here?

586
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,800
James.

587
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,530
Hey. It's nice to see you.

588
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,900
Yeah,feels all warm and comfy.

589
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,330
I spoke to todd about you.

590
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,600
Yeah?

591
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:34,330
He's very interested.

592
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,730
He said someone with your special-ops background

593
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,500
typically starts at about $200,000.

594
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,000
I could live with that.

595
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,860
You can meet him tonight. 9:00,Bar at the hilton.

596
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,360
I'll be there.

597
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,330
Sergeant doakes. I appreciate your time.

598
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,430
Can we get this over with,sir?

599
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,830
Okay.

600
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,460
It's interesting that of the 18 victims,

601
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,330
9 passed through this very station,

602
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,700
and you worked on cases involving 4 of them.

603
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,730
And you were unable to obtain a single conviction.

604
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,230
The smith case thrown out

605
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,360
because of inadmissible evidence.

606
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,760
Orozco skipped bail,never to be seen again.

607
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,260
The rodrigo case -- lost due to bad bloodwork.

608
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,760
Excuse me?

609
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,100
Oh,you weren't aware of that?

610
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,730
The d.A. Didn't get a conviction.

611
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,430
That's all I know.

612
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,200
Are we through here,sir?

613
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,460
No,actually. We're just getting -- we're done.

614
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,800
Look at this.

615
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:56,160
"June 1st -- mrs. Holcomb takes out trash,

616
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,930
drops soda bottle,doesn't pick it up."

617
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,660
"March 17th -- airplane flying too low."

618
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,200
I told you,this guy's a fruit bat.

619
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:10,460
"April." Hey,it's the month we want.

620
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,200
"April 16th"...

621
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,560
Fuck me sideways,listen to this.

622
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,660
"Rodrigo gets into car parked in wrong space.

623
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,800
Must be drunk because someone is carrying him."

624
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,330
The license plate's right here.

625
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,300
This is from 9:00 the night he disappeared.

626
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,800
The last time anyone saw him alive.

627
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,960
We got to run that plate.

628
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,900
I bet whoever owned this fucking car is our killer.

629
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,060
I'm gonna get lundy.

630
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,230
He's out with his feds.

631
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,830
Well,I'm calling him in.

632
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,730
Lila almost had me believing  it was possible to change,

633
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,500
to become something else,

634
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,460
as if that ever really happens.

635
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,400
I've always known what I am.

636
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:56,700
If the glove fits...

637
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,230
A secret cabin in the middle  of the everglades --

638
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:32,400
what more could a rededicated  serial killer ask for?

639
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,260
Cocaine.

640
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,730
Apparently mr. Jiminez never  gave up his old habits.

641
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,000
What a bad,bad man.

642
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,700
What? You think it just turned on by itself?

643
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,800
"Ugh,there is no such plate."

644
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,460
Is that a 1 or an "i"? Fuck you,lenny.

645
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,400
Fuck your handwriting.

646
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,300
Debra.

647
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,960
Kind of busy here.

648
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,400
Then can you please tell me where I can find Dexter?

649
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,130
I brought him some dinner.

650
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,660
Dexter's not here.

651
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,800
Where is he?

652
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,060
How should I know?

653
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,130
He said he was working late.

654
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,260
Is that what he told you?

655
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,430
What do you mean?

656
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,930
He's not working late.

657
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,030
I think he lied to you.

658
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,060
Oh,men are such pigs.

659
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:26,260
I'm so sorry. I'm sure he'll show up.

660
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,630
He's very excited about this job.

661
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,100
I swear,I have tried every combination.

662
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,600
Nothing is coming up.

663
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,560
I told you lenny would be a waste of time.

664
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,800
Maybe it's not a florida plate.

665
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,630
Try georgia.

666
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,200
Holy shit,here it is.

667
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:23,700
The vehicle was registered to charlie lewis.

668
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,630
I know that name.

669
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,500
A drug dealer out of new york.

670
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,200
A tough guy --

671
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,100
likes to carry a big-ass knife.

672
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,530
That's our guy. That's the bay harbor butcher.

673
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,800
I told you he wasn't a cop.

674
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,900
What?

675
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,300
Shit.

676
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,530
Where is he?

677
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,500
According to this,south bay correctional facility.

678
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,730
For how long?

679
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,900
Oh,shit.

680
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,360
Charlie lewis was arrested april 12,2002.

681
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,130
That's four days before rodrigo was seen

682
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,760
being carried into the car.

683
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,430
Who had his car? One of his gang?

684
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,100
This is where it gets really bad.

685
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,830
The vehicle was seized as evidence.

686
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,300
By who?

687
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:05,430
By our department.

688
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,100
Where was the vehicle held?

689
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:11,260
Right here in our evidence lab,behind a secure gate.

690
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,300
Someone signed the vehicle out,picked rodrigo up,

691
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,660
killed him,and then signed the vehicle back in.

692
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,200
So you have records.

693
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,900
Why would we keep them?

694
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,260
The only people allowed access to those vehicles

695
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,860
are members of the miami metro police department.

696
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,500
Holy shit.

697
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,230
Bay harbor butcher is one of our own.

698
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,960
We keep this to ourselves for now --

699
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,260
just the three of us.

700
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,200
I'm gonna go tell it to a bottle of scotch.

701
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,930
Here we are again.

702
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,330
What -- what the fuck?!

703
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,760
I know. I keep asking myself that same question.

704
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,930
Let me out of here!

705
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,330
But...

706
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,960
I'm finding it's best to accept things you can't change,

707
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,260
you know?

708
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,230
Normally,I'd have a chat

709
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,660
to make sure you understand why you're here,but...

710
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,900
I think you have a pretty good idea.

711
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,200
Let me go.

712
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,660
I got cocaine.

713
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,000
You can have all of it.

714
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:11,800
It's funny you should say that. I am off the wagon.

715
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:15,130
But that was never my drug.

716
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,300
I'll fucking kill you!

717
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,330
No,mr. Jiminez.

718
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,360
I'm gonna kill you tonight...

719
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,600
For what you did to my mother...

720
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:36,960
And because,well,this is what I do best.

721
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,800
It's kind of fitting,don't you think?

722
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,660
Astor,cody,come on,let's eat.

723
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,930
How'd you get the door unlocked?

724
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,600
It was already open.

725
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,760
Oh,that's odd.

726
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Starlight lanes 1690 michigan 7:00

727
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,130
lila.

728
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,760
Hello?

729
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,200
Dexter,hi.

730
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,060
Um,look,I'm sorry to bother you,

731
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,730
and I'm sure this is nothing,

732
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,700
but I was just wondering if by chance you were at my house.

733
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:08,660
Uh,well,no.

734
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,300
Well,it's just that the door was open

735
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,860
and you're the only other one with a key.

736
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,200
Rita,get out of the house. Call the police.

737
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,360
I'll be there as soon as I can.

739
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,160
I can't take you with me.

740
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,560
Don't go anywhere!

741
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,260
Oh,hey,I'm sorry to drag you into this.

742
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,160
No,no,I'm glad you called. The kids?

743
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,800
Next door.

744
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,630
The place is empty. No sign of forcible entry.

745
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,900
I'm guessing you just forgot to lock the door.

746
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:54,500
If you need anything else --

747
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:55,730
no,no. You're not leaving.

748
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,960
Sir?

749
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,600
Someone was in this house.

750
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,630
I need you to stay here in the house

751
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,060
until I tell you it's safe.

752
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,560
Really? I need to do those things.

753
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,930
I'm with miami metro homicide.

754
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,400
I know you don't take orders from me,

755
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:08,600
but if you'd like,

756
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,260
I could get lieutenant laguerta on the phone.

757
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,200
Or if you prefer to speak to captain matthews,

758
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,560
I could arrange that,as well.

759
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,460
Dexter,what's going on?

760
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,930
Please,just stay here,okay?

761
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,430
It's one thing to fuck with me

762
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:25,830
another to fuck with my  ex-girlfriend who hates me.

763
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:29,130
The lila experiment is officially over.

764
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,430
Dexter!

765
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,760
Give me rita's key.

766
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,760
Well,that's your fault,isn't it,Dexter?

767
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,260
You lied to me about working late,

768
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,530
and I thought I might find you there.

769
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,660
Do not ever go to rita's house again.

770
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,130
Do you understand?

771
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,700
Do you understand?

772
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,460
Is this the monster that you keep telling me about?

773
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,500
Trust me,when you meet the monster,you'll know.

774
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,660
You called jiminez.

775
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,530
Yeah, I suppose I did.

776
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,100
Why?

777
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:17,460
Why would you try to have me killed?

778
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,300
You weren't going to get killed.

779
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:21,500
That's why I did it at the bowling alley,

780
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:24,100
so all your police-officer friends would be there.

781
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,030
What were you thinking?! Are you insane?!

782
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,160
I was trying to bring us back together again!

783
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:34,360
You were pulling away,and...

784
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,530
Remember at the hotel after you faced jiminez?

785
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,860
That -- that's what I wanted!

786
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,400
To bring you back.

787
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:51,360
So you called him?

788
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,500
Well,it worked,didn't it?

789
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:57,560
Last night. You and I.

790
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,160
You fell asleep in my arms.

791
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,160
What?!

792
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:11,200
You --

793
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:16,730
you are more dangerous than my addiction will ever be.

794
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,360
That's saying a lot.

795
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,000
Stay away from rita.

796
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,760
Stay away from me.

797
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,200
Or what?

798
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,530
Or you will see the monster.
