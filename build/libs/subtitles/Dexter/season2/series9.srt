1
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,128
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,005
You'll notice we have
some new faces here.

3
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,756
Are we under investigation?

4
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,341
Sloppy blood work.

5
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:12,553
I asked myself,
"How the hell did that happen?"

6
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,849
Bay Harbor Butcher is one of our own.

7
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,601
Dexter and I broke up.

8
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,271
Does that mean he doesn't like us either?

9
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,064
Would you have dinner with me
tomorrow night?

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,649
I'd love to have dinner with you.

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,155
Your past was a bigger mystery
than fucking Jimmy Hoffa.

12
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,366
It's time to make Doakes go away.

13
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,375
Sergeant James Doakes
is on administrative leave

14
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,544
pending an internal affairs investigation.

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,837
Are we through here, sir?

16
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,590
- No, actually. We're just getting...
- We're done.

17
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,385
Oh. There's my sponsor.

18
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,762
This woman sees me.

19
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,388
I don't care what you did.

20
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:59,058
She's looking behind the mask,
and she's not turning away.

21
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,768
You a friend of Dexter's?

22
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,562
I'm his decorator. Love the hat.

23
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,068
Dexter!

24
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,361
Help, please!

25
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,698
I need to embrace who I am. I need to kill the
man who murdered my mother.

26
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,743
A secret cabin in the middle
of the Everglades -

27
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,829
what more could a rededicated
serial killer ask for?

28
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,748
It's kind of fitting, don't you think?

29
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:38,514
Well, it's just that the door was open
and you're the only other one with a key.

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,849
Rita, get out of the house.
Call the police.

31
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,602
I can't take you with me.

32
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,772
Someone was in this house.

33
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,816
- Dexter, what's going on?
- Please, just stay here.

34
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,527
Stay away from Rita.

35
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,071
Stay away from me.

36
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,565
- That's what I said.
- That I'm always right?

37
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,485
That you were right about Lila.
She was bad for me.

38
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:00,030
And that I'm always right!
Hurry the fuck up!

39
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,699
I didn't realize how bad till last night.

40
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,203
Hey, Vince. How's it going?

41
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,288
She had me fighting
with myself the whole time.

42
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,666
All that self-reflection is unhealthy.

43
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,834
Stop reflecting and move.

44
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,545
- Whoa.
- Sorry.

45
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,924
The fact is I already know who I am,
and I'm done fighting it.

46
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,094
So the battle's over. Lila's over.

47
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,596
Morgan, clean this mess up.

48
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,391
It's a goddamn safety hazard.

49
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,116
Can't leave this shit lying around, bro.

50
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,793
Nice - my subconscious isn't
even bothering with symbolism.

51
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,089
That's what I get for leaving the remains
of Jimenez up in that cabin.

52
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,800
Bad time to get sloppy,
with Special Agent Lundy

53
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:06,138
putting everyone in law enforcement
under a microscope.

54
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,018
Dexter? What are you doing here?

55
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,146
I...

56
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,109
just wanted to give you that.

57
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,488
You're in the same clothes as last night.

58
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,949
You slept here?

59
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,617
Not intentionally.

60
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:32,164
I just wanted to make sure
whoever broke in stayed away.

61
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,916
I guess I kind of fell asleep on the job.

62
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,127
Sorry.

63
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,463
Don't be.

64
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,424
- Dexter! Dexter's here!
- Hey, guys!

65
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,553
Dexter, I made a killer robot
that eats airplanes. Want to see?

66
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,473
Mom's making pancakes.
You want bananas in yours?

67
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,438
Actually, guys, there's something
I got to go deal with, so...

68
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,690
Then why'd you come?

69
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,568
'Cause you needed one of these.

70
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,786
All right, guys,

71
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,539
Dexter's got work to do,
so go eat pancakes.

72
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,084
Add extra bananas for me.

73
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,384
I didn't mean for them to find me here.

74
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,638
Well, it's OK. I think they needed a hug too.

75
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,766
Take care, Dexter.

76
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,268
Wait. I want to say something.

77
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,153
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,865
- All right.
- I feel...

79
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,662
such regret,

80
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:57,666
which is rare for me.

81
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:02,546
But not that I don't mess up, I do,

82
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,007
just never so stupendously.

83
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:11,054
I had you and them.

84
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,892
And I had us. So much to have.

85
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:21,857
And just to demolish it,

86
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,776
I honestly thought
that I was smarter than that.

87
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,903
Rude awakening.

88
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,740
Lila was one of the biggest
mistakes of my life.

89
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,912
It means a lot to me, Dexter.

90
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:42,043
But it doesn't change the fact
that you slept with another woman.

91
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,213
- I can't forget that.
- I don't expect you to. I just...

92
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,299
wanted to say it.

93
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,894
All I can do now is
pick up the pieces of Jimenez.

94
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,104
He's one big pile of evidence -

95
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,691
not that anyone will easily
break into that cabin, the thing's a bunker.

96
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,943
Still, I can't leave a kill lying around.

97
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,778
I'll have to call in sick at work.

98
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,178
It's not Doakes. FBI.

99
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,804
My feeble interview with Lundy

100
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,682
might have put me
on his shortlist of suspects.

101
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,727
Left turn to the cabin...

102
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,146
right turn to a change of clothes and work.

103
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:49,694
Glad I'm at peace with Harry's code again.
It makes decisions easier -

104
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,447
caution first, Jimenez later.

105
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,920
Announcing arrival of flight 274

106
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,382
from Santiago, Dominican Republic,
gate 20-B.

107
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:14,010
Your call has been forwarded to a
voice-message system.

108
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,555
- James Doakes...
- ...is not available.

109
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,766
To page this person, press five now.

110
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,981
You know what? Fuck you, James.
Fuck you and your disappearing act.

111
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,358
You know, you didn't
just stand me up last night.

112
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,944
You screwed yourself
out of a six-figure security job,

113
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,490
which means that being a cop
is one of the few options you have left.

114
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:39,578
So, stop pissing off the people
that can help you.

115
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:43,081
Lundy's people have been
trying to reach you.

116
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,418
They just want a hand
with the Bay Harbor Butcher case.

117
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,169
James, give it to them.

118
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,964
Show Lundy that you are a team player.

119
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,757
Fake it.

120
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,345
And pick up when I call again.

121
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,556
'Cause I'm gonna keep calling.

122
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,019
I'm not giving up on you, James.

123
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,450
Your right eye is a little darker
than your left eye.

124
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,455
And you weigh about 50 pounds.

125
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,540
I'm gonna have to fatten you up.

126
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,043
Didn't seem to bother you last night...

127
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,086
or this morning.

128
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:35,008
So much for taking it slow, huh?

129
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,094
The slow part was nice.

130
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,681
I guess that's the perk
of dating a man who's experienced.

131
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,975
Read "old guy".

132
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,478
Read what I said.

133
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:50,815
Experienced, as in technique...

134
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,859
as in mad skills.

135
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,748
Are you always gonna be this touchy
about the age thing? 'Cause that will get old.

136
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:07,957
Sorry.

137
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:12,170
This is new territory for me,
dating in general,

138
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,924
dating someone so young in particular,

139
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,009
and dating a co-worker especially.

140
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:22,222
Ooh. So I'm the more
experienced one. Cool.

141
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,765
You've dated co-workers?

142
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,393
OK, not that experienced.

143
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:32,941
Well, I've seen enough of them
to see where they go wrong, and, uh...

144
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,943
experience tells me that...

145
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,529
full disclosure is the best way to go.

146
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,865
What, like...

147
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,034
tell people at work?

148
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:48,164
Debra, I'm an aboveboard kind of guy,

149
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,667
and in the history of office romances,

150
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,877
sneaking around has never worked.

151
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,796
I don't know.

152
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,883
Things are just so tense
around the station right now.

153
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,386
So you're worried
about making people tense?

154
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,555
I just think the timing is bad.

155
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,349
Maybe we should wait until we can...

156
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,567
Lundy.

157
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,987
When?

158
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,906
Notify DC.

159
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:25,493
Then get Cal to go sit
on Mendelsohn until he signs.

160
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,203
Yeah.

161
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,916
And then call the field office
and get me more bodies.

162
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,836
Well, we need to move on this now.

163
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:39,215
Yes. OK.

164
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,468
- What's up?
- Not sure.

165
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,803
Something break on the Butcher?

166
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,930
I got to go.

167
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,933
There's quiche. Eat it.

168
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,269
Wait, shouldn't we finish
talking about this whole...

169
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,398
full-disclosure thing?

170
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,619
Lundy's bees are buzzing.

171
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,705
Something has agitated the hive.

172
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,752
My money's on Connolly down in Property.

173
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,254
Looks like much ado
about something in there.

174
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,548
Lundy's got a suspect
for the Bay Harbor Butcher,

175
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,384
and, bro, it's one of us here.

176
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:27,180
That's...disturbing.

177
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,516
We're not sure
that Lundy's picked someone,

178
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,643
but if he has, it sure as hell
isn't one of my people.

179
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,395
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
but I confirmed it myself last night.

180
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,231
Everything points to someone in this house.

181
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,690
Who in this house?

182
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,109
I don't know, but something
must have broke this morning,

183
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,488
'cause Lundy shut us PD
out of the task force, brought more Feds in.

184
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,949
So he definitely has someone
in his cross hairs.

185
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,786
What about Steinbauer in Impound?
Dude's a freak.

186
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,080
- I bet it's Wykoff from Records.
- Chico, please.

187
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,790
What about Loring in Narcotics?

188
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,167
Or it could be that murderous Morgan
in Blood Spatter.

189
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,086
Maybe I was being watched this morning.

190
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,922
But they'd be doing
more than watching if they had proof.

191
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,049
What's going on in there?

192
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,051
You tell us.

193
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,179
- Why would I know?
- Come on. You're Lundy's pet.

194
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,931
- Fuck you.
- Seriously,

195
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,933
what's Lundy got,
or is he just blowing smoke?

196
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,019
Seriously, I don't know.
But if he's got something, it ain't smoke.

197
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:19,107
- Lundy's too good to blow smoke.
- Man, no wonder you're his pet.

198
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,359
- Fuck you twice.
- OK, enough. Enough.

199
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,988
If you're not on the task force,
you're clearing cases for the day.

200
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,865
Missed you too.

201
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,785
Morgan.

202
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,881
- We've got company.
- Yeah, I noticed.

203
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,716
Not there.

204
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,217
In there...

205
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,219
waiting for you.

206
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,889
Lundy brought in
his own forensic techs.

207
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:55,059
- What are they looking for?
- Think they'd tell me?

208
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,228
I'm just the LFI.

209
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,817
Lead forensics investigator -
or at least I used to be.

210
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,444
Well, fuck 'em.

211
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,573
They can have their fucking title
and the acronym that goes with it,

212
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,325
fucking Indian givers.

213
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,501
Dexter Morgan.

214
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,003
In the flesh.

215
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,213
Please give me your access code
for the forensic database.

216
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,299
I'd like you to walk me
through your filing system.

217
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,885
I'll need a breakdown
of procedure and protocol.

218
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,970
Is there something particular
I can help you with?

219
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,681
We just need your help
navigating the lab.

220
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,224
Your code, please.

221
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,394
May I?

222
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,782
If they're looking for proof,
they won't find it. Not here, at least.

223
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:55,328
I may have briefly rebelled against Harry,
but I learned my lessons well.

224
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,497
Come on, Dex. Tell me.

225
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,249
Make sure they deserve it.

226
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:06,422
Dexter, this is life-or-death stuff.
It's that important.

227
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,968
Why do you think I pulled
all those strings to arrange this?

228
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,553
Dexter, now, come on. Tell me.

229
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,098
What is the number one rule?

230
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,933
Don't get caught.

231
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,185
And what are all the other rules for?

232
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,396
So I don't get caught.

233
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,650
You ready for this?

234
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,111
I'm ready.

235
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,130
Why are they looking at us like that?

236
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,925
They don't know why you're here,

237
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,136
why you need to see this.

238
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,724
But I want this
seared into your mind, son.

239
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,450
The chair?

240
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,161
The chair?

241
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:40,475
Cross-check our data with Interpol.
See where it leads. Yeah.

242
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,352
- Hi.
- Hey.

243
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,814
So, bats out of hell move slower
than you did this morning.

244
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,650
I know. I'm sorry.
But as you can see...

245
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,570
- Something's up.
- Something's up.

246
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,324
'Cause I wondered if maybe
you were also cheesed

247
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,077
about my whole not-disclosing thing.

248
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,079
I don't want you to think

249
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,414
I'm unsure or...

250
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,918
embarrassed or anything.

251
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,128
Why would you be embarrassed? I'm hot.

252
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,590
Yeah. You got that right.

253
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:16,052
Hey, look, it had nothing to do with you,

254
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,597
except that it made you feel bad,
which was not my intention, it's just...

255
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,599
- Something's up.
- Something's up.

256
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,643
What?

257
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,021
- I really can't tell you.
- Why not?

258
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:31,025
Honestly, you don't want to know.

259
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,439
It's a ghost from my past.

260
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,942
I wasn't sure I'd be able to find you.

261
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,737
I'm in the phone book now.
Last place you look, eh?

262
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,574
It's good to see you, Leones.

263
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,828
My father-in-law will be happy we have
a customer with American dollars.

264
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,998
Looks like you're
in the travel business now, huh?

265
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,250
Orbitz, man, it's killing us.

266
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,920
And people only think of Haiti
for war and poverty.

267
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,047
But the brave ones still come.

268
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,175
We arrange tours between the islands.

269
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,844
No more sneaking people over the border
in the middle of the night?

270
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,638
My wife would castrate me.

271
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,974
I work only for her father now.

272
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,435
The man is Satan on wheels.

273
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,645
I hope the dog will bite him.

274
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,736
So, what can I arrange for you?

275
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,531
Maybe the Rosewood Resort
on Little Dix, huh?

276
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,034
Only the best for my old friend.

277
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,331
I was thinking more like
the hospital in Dom Rep.

278
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,585
- You are sick?
- No.

279
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,338
But I need a...a discreet lab.

280
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,715
A relaxing cruise is better.

281
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,885
There's a shuffleboard tournament
on the Jewel Of The Seas.

282
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,803
Big stakes.

283
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,723
Leones, you were always the one to see,
no questions asked,

284
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:29,644
- whenever we needed shit.
- I am not a fixer any more,

285
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,189
and you are not in black operations.

286
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,901
I'm a travel agent, and I like it.

287
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,613
No one tries to kill me or torture me...

288
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,199
except for him,

289
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,910
with his vicious dog and foul breath.

290
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,913
Listen, this isn't dangerous, man.

291
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,916
I just need some blood slides analyzed.

292
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,794
Leones, I need your help.

293
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,090
This is all you want?
The slides analyzed?

294
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,635
And your most expensive
tour package of the islands.

295
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,555
Give me the slides. I'll see what I can do.

296
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,725
Confirm the arrangements first.
I'll bring them over by boat.

297
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,269
Avoiding Customs.

298
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,813
Don't want to risk it with biological materials.

299
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,941
Just tell me, James.

300
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,152
Are you in trouble?

301
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,904
No.

302
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,573
But someone else is gonna be.

303
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,826
OK.

304
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,705
That takes us through '95's
discoverable notes.

305
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,123
'94.

306
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,375
How far back are you looking?

307
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,128
Let's start with knife wounds.

308
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,964
To search by cause of death,
go to the upper right-hand...

309
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,174
It's OK. I'm good.

310
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,220
They're wasting their time here.

311
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:50,099
If they had a warrant for my apartment,
they'd find blood slides and killing tools.

312
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,851
Got to move those.

313
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,103
Got to dispose of Jimenez.

314
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,314
Instead, I'm waiting for the fat man to sing.

315
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,982
- Why don't I just...
- I've got it.

316
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,859
- It will be faster...
- I've got it!

317
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,528
In fact, I think we can get along
on our own from here.

318
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,322
And he sings.

319
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,121
I'm wearing green underpants.

320
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,956
Are you?

321
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,419
Yeah, but when he bought them,
they were white.

322
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,212
Too much information!

323
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,515
Look who's come out of his cave.

324
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,310
Lila, what are you doing here?

325
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,853
She came to see me, bro.

326
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,022
Angel mentioned
that he needed a decorator,

327
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:42,193
and, well, a slot just came up,
so I gave him a call.

328
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,278
I've always wanted a decorator.

329
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,530
Angel, come here.

330
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,033
She's not really a decorator.

331
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,328
It's not really my apartment
that I want decorated.

332
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:56,749
So, hey, the boys here
have persuaded me to go for a drink.

333
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,460
- Or ten.
- Oh, God. Should I be worried?

334
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,463
Yes. You should.

335
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,549
Then maybe you should come with us,

336
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,427
because who knows what secrets
will come pouring out of me

337
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,054
once the drinks start flowing.

338
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,349
Hey, Lila, um, I have 2,000 square feet

339
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,101
that needs a total makeover.

340
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,436
You got 800 if you count your parking space.

341
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,688
She can do it twice.

342
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:25,236
I have to get to Jimenez,
but a dead man tells no tales.

343
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,406
A drunk, unstable woman very well may.

344
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,498
But do you call me
Paddy the road builder?

345
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:41,252
No, and me, with my own two hands,
I built the town library.

346
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,463
But do you call me
Paddy the library giver?

347
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,173
No.

348
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,677
But you fuck one little goat...

349
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,930
All right. I got one.

350
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,808
- Stop, stop.
- What? It's a good one.

351
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,310
Knowing you, it would be inappropriate
in front of a lady.

352
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,229
She just did a goat-fucker joke.

353
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,858
Aw, you're such a protector, Angel.

354
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,568
I do my best.

355
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:09,572
Like that time that you came
to Dexter's rescue at the bowling alley.

356
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:15,619
You just ran right towards that mugger,
no thought for your own personal safety.

357
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,288
That's my job.

358
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,748
- Mine too.
- It is not.

359
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,918
Don't do it, Lila. Don't bring Jimenez up.

360
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,963
Did they ever catch that guy?

361
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,090
Yeah, Dex, did you ever file a report?

362
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:31,802
- I can still look into it.
- I'm sure he's long gone by now.

363
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,601
Yeah. Anyway, I'm gonna go to the loo.

364
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,645
The loo?

365
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,814
How cute is that?

366
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,567
It's... Right?

367
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,161
What the hell do you want?

368
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,664
I'm concerned.

369
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,126
Usually, when someone quits their sponsor,
it means they're using again.

370
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:08,464
You can quit the sponsor bullshit.
I'm done with it and you.

371
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,008
Did I not make that clear last night?

372
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,260
It's out of order.

373
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,557
- There's still work we can do together.
- No, there isn't.

374
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,645
I am who I am, and I don't want you
coming anywhere near me or my addiction.

375
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,856
- Do you understand?
- Oh, I understand...

376
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,567
- how lonely you are.
- Stop.

377
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,320
Those friends of yours out there,
they didn't even know you.

378
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,865
They just see the mask, but I see it all.

379
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,493
I can see how upset you are.

380
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,455
No, really?

381
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,915
No.

382
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,501
It's more than just me
that's eating at you.

383
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,295
There's something else.

384
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,882
You don't have to handle it alone.

385
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,176
I can help.

386
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,972
I know how heavy that mask is,

387
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,515
how tiring.

388
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:04,103
I'm the only one who can see behind it,
and it doesn't scare me.

389
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,897
It's like looking in the mirror.

390
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,733
It's why we belong together.

391
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,364
Hey, asshole, it's ladies only.

392
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,242
My mistake.

393
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,869
- He giving you trouble?
- A little.

394
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,623
But I know he'll see I'm right.

395
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,875
I know you will.

396
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,880
You are not driving.

397
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,051
Fuck you. Fine.

398
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,182
Can't live with her. Can't kill her.

399
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,936
She's not going away.

400
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,941
Neither is that undercover car.

401
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,570
So much for paranoia.

402
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,073
Those Feds are real.

403
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,256
Lundy found my slides.

404
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,385
It's over.

405
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,894
You're out of shampoo. Sorry.

406
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,855
- Yours is better than mine.
- What are you doing here?

407
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,483
My new place isn't set up yet.

408
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,610
I don't want to make a habit
of staying at Lundy's.

409
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,197
I mean, what if people find out? It would be
a whole new reason to disrespect me.

410
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,075
Maybe they already know.
They keep assuming I have inside intel.

411
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,494
They're always asking me
what Lundy knows.

412
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,120
What does he know? Tell me.

413
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,247
Fuck, Dex, I'm talking about
my feelings here.

414
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,583
What the fuck is your problem?

415
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:53,295
Look, I know he's old,
and it's complicated and whatever,

416
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:58,425
but I feel like he's someone
I can, you know, count on.

417
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,011
That's good, Deb. You should have that,
because I won't always be...

418
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,848
Who the fuck is that at this hour?

419
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,937
- Deb, don't.
- What the fuck?

420
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,691
Dexter Morgan.

421
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:18,028
Special Agent Lundy wants to see you.
Please come with us.

422
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:21,865
Wait. Lundy didn't say anything
about this to me.

423
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,993
- I'm sorry, Deb.
- I'm on the fucking task force.

424
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,372
I demand to know what...

425
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,041
I'm right behind you.
They're calling us in.

426
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,377
I'm right behind you, Dex.

427
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,923
We got him.

428
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,176
I should be panicked, terrified,

429
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,053
but Lila was right.

430
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,055
The mask has been heavy.

431
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:48,767
I won't need it in surrender. I can let it go.

432
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,686
The pain will come

433
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,022
when Deb finally understands
who her brother really is.

434
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:02,990
Rita's horror, the kids' tears.

435
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,068
My old friends, here to betray me.

436
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,614
Please sit down.

437
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,577
I'm sure that you heard we have a suspect

438
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,288
in the Bay Harbor Butcher case.

439
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,915
Put them on.

440
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,796
We now have the evidence to back it up.

441
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,758
We need answers, now.

442
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,304
Open it.

443
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,950
Explain it to us.

444
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,037
Trophies.

445
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,289
That's what I thought.

446
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,293
What happens now?

447
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,921
I know this will come
as a shock to you, Morgan,

448
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:45,425
but our primary suspect
is someone you know well.

449
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,681
Sergeant James Doakes.

450
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,558
Sergeant...

451
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,309
Doakes?

452
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,897
He was the lead case investigator
on four of the Butcher victims,

453
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,108
which put him on my radar.

454
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,528
We looked into his background.

455
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,698
It turns out his father
was a butcher, and abusive.

456
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,742
Doakes was also a trained assassin
in Special Forces.

457
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,955
That, along with his on-the-job shootings and
excessive-force citations...

458
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,666
- He fits the profile.
- Yes.

459
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,628
He has a need to dole out
personal justice.

460
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,673
Yesterday, Doakes walked
out of an interview and disappeared.

461
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,051
This morning, we were alerted
that he boarded a plane out of the country.

462
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:31,221
That enabled me to get warrants
on his apartment and car.

463
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,893
He had the slides?

464
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:39,354
Carefully hidden in the trunk
of his car at the airport.

465
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,440
It all makes so much sense.

466
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,485
Everyone else in the precinct
was beyond shocked when I told them.

467
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,699
What exactly is Sergeant Doakes's
problem with you, Morgan?

468
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,076
I kill people, for one.

469
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,954
But what was it
Sergeant Doakes said about me?

470
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,291
I've always sensed there was something...

471
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,502
off about him...

472
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,714
like he's hiding in plain sight.

473
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,551
I never concealed my doubts.

474
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,428
So he attacked you.

475
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,597
Well, he might try it again,

476
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,892
particularly when he finds out
that he's our prime suspect.

477
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,686
Yeah. That should piss him off.

478
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,064
We've tried to keep an eye on you
from a distance.

479
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,525
- The undercover cars.
- Not undercover enough, obviously.

480
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:30,447
I'm sorry for the abrupt pickup tonight,
but from here on out,

481
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,699
we'll want a protective detail
on you at all times.

482
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,494
That could complicate my life.

483
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,372
Dexter, it will keep Doakes at bay.

484
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,623
Good point.

485
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,416
What happens now is we need you

486
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,336
to analyze and match
these slides immediately.

487
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,462
Me?

488
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,464
I'm keeping the forensics in-house.

489
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,217
The public needs to see our strength now.

490
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,261
Their trust in us is about to take
a major ass-fucking.

491
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,765
Now, I'm making you first forensic tech

492
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,184
in the chain of custody with these slides.

493
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,812
I figure you have
more motivation than most

494
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:05,315
to see Doakes brought to justice,
so I know you'll be thorough.

495
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:15,617
The TSA is circulating
Doakes's photo to all major airports.

496
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,413
Sergeant Doakes.
He peeked behind the curtain.

497
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,914
He saw who I am.

498
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,916
But it only put him in the line of fire.

499
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,502
There's an APB out
on the eastern seaboard if he moves north.

500
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,879
- I still don't believe it.
- Because it's not true.

501
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,341
- I don't know...
- Don't, Vince.

502
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,305
Just don't.

503
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,185
I didn't know.

504
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:46,356
- I swear Lundy didn't tell me.
- I believe you.

505
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,443
Big fucking manhunt mobilizing out there.

506
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,611
We'll get him, Dex.

507
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,239
And when you do,
my story has to be stronger than his.

508
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:58,910
Don't worry, I'm gonna be with you
every step of the way. Me and this.

509
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,204
I have an even bigger favor.

510
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,372
Name it.

511
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,374
Move into that new apartment of yours.

512
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,544
Deb, if you got in the middle of this
and you got hurt...

513
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,547
Hurt? I'm a fucking cop.

514
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,884
You're my sister first and I'm gonna worry like a
brother, not a co-worker.

515
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,761
Don't, God damn it.
You have enough to worry about.

516
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,387
I can't help it.

517
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,098
Deb, the best thing you can do for me

518
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,018
is to give me and my protective detail
a wide berth.

519
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,521
Fucker.

520
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,109
Fine.

521
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,737
I fucking hate it, but I get it.

522
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,285
One less pair of eyes to worry about.

523
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,419
You just can't get rid of me, can you?

524
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,925
LaGuerta.

525
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,260
You know I didn't do this.

526
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,554
You know me, Maria. That's not me.

527
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,225
Yeah, but they don't.

528
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,185
What do they have on me?

529
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,437
They found something in your car.

530
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,397
Oh, shit.

531
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,942
The longer you stay out, the worse it gets.

532
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,945
The only way I can help you
is if you turn yourself in.

533
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,072
No one will listen without proof.

534
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,408
- Of what?
- Look, I don't want to pull you into this.

535
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,204
The next time you see me,
there'll be no doubt.

536
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,373
Until then, you won't be able to contact me.

537
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:30,085
- Don't you disappear on me, James.
- Maria, I have to do this.

538
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,671
God damn!

539
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,881
Listen to me.

540
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,801
I just want you to know
that you meant a lot to me.

541
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,095
More than you know, and...

542
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,265
I just want to thank you for that.

543
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,767
What does that mean?

544
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,941
Wait. Wait.

545
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:21,052
Looks like I won't find
any prints or DNA on this box.

546
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,181
I can chalk it up to how careful Doakes is.

547
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,517
Harry had strict rules
about not hurting the innocent,

548
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,312
and for all his fury...

549
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,023
Doakes is innocent.

550
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,151
But there's also the number one rule -
don't get caught.

551
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:42,490
Still, he'll fight this,
and I'll have to disprove him.

552
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,788
He could win...

553
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,917
or he could end up paying for my crimes.

554
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,237
Morning.

555
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,949
Mr. Morgan,

556
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,910
Special Agent Lundy thought
you might need our help.

557
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,703
Please come in.

558
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,748
Sorry about
all the secrecy yesterday.

559
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,875
We were reviewing
Sergeant Doakes's cases,

560
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,670
and, well, you understand.

561
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,839
I need you to do the liquid extractions

562
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,384
and centrifuging on these samples.

563
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,595
- The cells just started digesting.
- Then we'll come back in 12 hours.

564
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,889
The samples should be watched
at all times.

565
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,891
Don't let anyone in or out of the lab,

566
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,186
and don't let the incubator
dip below 37 Celsius.

567
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,939
And, please, don't touch anything.

568
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,400
You understand.

569
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,822
That was satisfying.

570
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,955
Dex! Hey, bro!

571
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:21,131
Are you OK, man?
This shit with Doakes is crazy...

572
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,425
- Yeah. I have to go, Angel.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

573
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,262
Are you pissed or something
about Lila and me?

574
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,473
- Oh, yeah. That.
- Dex, I don't want it getting between us.

575
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,475
- If you still want her...
- God, no.

576
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:36,479
Lila's insane, destructive,
a naturally occurring disaster.

577
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,649
- OK, so you don't mind if I go for it, then.
- What? No.

578
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,027
Look, Angel, here's the real truth

579
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,988
Lila's just using you to get at me.

580
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,741
- So what?
- So what?

581
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,618
Look, Dex, no one's used me
for good or bad reasons

582
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,037
since my wife divorced me.

583
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,913
Damn sure no one as hot as Lila.

584
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,333
- You may be missing my point.
- Look...

585
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,961
first it was the divorce,
then getting stabbed was no picnic,

586
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,005
and now this thing with Doakes.

587
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,800
Dark days, my friend, too dark.

588
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,094
Man, I need a light
at the end of the tunnel, man,

589
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,931
and Lila's it, all right?

590
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,684
All right, then.

591
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,687
Angel just doesn't get it. Lila's no solution.

592
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,647
She's a problem.

593
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,276
Shall we?

594
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,238
Just like my little groupies.

595
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,374
I couldn't tell you.

596
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,919
- Even with my brother at risk?
- We had him covered.

597
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,630
It would have forced you
to divide your loyalties.

598
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,924
Plus, I didn't want to appear to favor you.

599
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,677
- They all think you favor me anyway.
- Maybe because I do.

600
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,806
- Do you think they know?
- Not until you tell them.

601
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,974
Special Agent Lundy.

602
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,645
- You're giving Doakes to the press?
- Best way to bring him in.

603
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:02,399
- If you publicly accuse him...
- I'm not accusing anyone.

604
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,777
Doakes is wanted for questioning,
and that's what my press release says.

605
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,028
It will still destroy him.

606
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,739
He's doing a fine job of destroying himself.

607
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:14,786
- He is not your man.
- He is, however, my prime suspect.

608
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,122
Look.

609
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,375
I'm willing to work with you on this,

610
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,585
but only if you let me
take lead with the media.

611
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,797
Lieutenant, I am not letting you
anywhere near the media.

612
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,676
He may be your ex-partner.
He may be your best friend.

613
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,970
What he is to me is a suspect.

614
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,722
So you deal with that
however you need to.

615
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,475
And you will give me
your complete cooperation,

616
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,686
or you may find yourself out of a job.

617
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,075
It's mine.

618
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:58,872
Hello?

619
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,957
It...it's me.

620
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,126
I wasn't sure I should call.

621
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,669
I'm glad you did.

622
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,755
It's probably best I move on,

623
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,383
but the kids were so happy
to see you yesterday,

624
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:14,637
and I wasn't, you know, unhappy.

625
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,432
Well, that's good, right?

626
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:21,144
I just... I need to know one thing.

627
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,439
Is it over with Lila?

628
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,609
Yes. Absolutely, completely over.

629
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,944
If I never see her again, it'll be too soon.

630
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,372
Hello?

631
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,292
I have feelings for you.

632
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,295
I have feelings for you too.

633
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,673
I'm not gonna fight them any more.

634
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:53,676
I think we should get together and talk.

635
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,261
Tonight?

636
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,142
That would be great, really great.
But tonight's...

637
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,811
No, this...is a bad idea.

638
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,356
No, Rita, it's the best idea
you've ever had.

639
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:10,109
It's just we've got a big break
in the Bay Harbor Butcher case.

640
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,695
Things are kind of intense around here.

641
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,489
Oh, wow. Did they catch him?

642
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,535
Well, someone's gonna go down for it.

643
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,246
But tomorrow would be really great.

644
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,874
OK. Tomorrow.

645
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,417
I'll look forward to it.

646
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,345
We're getting together tomorrow.

647
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,848
Communication's the key.

648
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,189
The light at the end of the tunnel.

649
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,038
All clear.

650
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,165
We'll have a man stationed
at the front and side doors

651
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,917
and two in the parking lot.

652
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,712
Just give us a yell if anything arises.

653
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,507
Nothing's gonna arise, certainly not me -
not until tomorrow morning.

654
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,217
I'm exhausted.

655
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:19,053
Don't let anyone near this door
for any reason.

656
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:23,057
- Shoot them if you have to.
- No problem. Sleep tight.

657
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,063
Sleep would be nice,

658
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:32,275
but there's too much to do.

659
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,737
The good news is my new friends
will keep Doakes away.

660
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,407
The bad news is they make
getting to Jimenez difficult...

661
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,119
but not impossible.

662
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,538
Fortunately, a car isn't the only way

663
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,498
to reach the Everglades,

664
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,752
and my new marina's
only a 20-minute walk.

665
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,802
I'm on my way, Jimenez.

666
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,971
Don't decompose just yet.

667
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,570
I'll be against the current on the way back.

668
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:21,032
With bagging, cleanup
and detour to the Gulf Stream -

669
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,576
tight, but I should be home by daybreak.

670
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,292
It's time to get you
out of my life once and for all.

671
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:37,423
- You got to talk to Lundy.
- About what?

672
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,842
Get him to hold off
on putting Doakes on the news.

673
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,511
Maybe you should talk to Lundy.

674
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,223
Morgan, you're one of us.
Doakes is one of us.

675
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,517
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

676
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:51,646
Look, Lieutenant, I know he's your friend,

677
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:55,441
and we're all pretty fucked up about this,
but it is Lundy's ballgame.

678
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,986
But he listens to you. You're his right hand.

679
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,322
Right hand? Just say it.

680
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:04,617
Fuck the euphemisms.
And OK, I may be sleeping with him,

681
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,536
but that doesn't mean he tells me shit

682
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,955
or listens to me about anything,
so stop asking.

683
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,165
You're sleeping with Lundy?

684
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,840
I'm sleeping at your place again tonight.

685
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,739
Just one more trip.

686
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,907
Ahead of schedule.

687
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:51,581
That's right, motherfucker. It's over.

688
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,673
How'd you find me?

689
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,633
GPS tap on your boat.

690
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,969
Jesus Christ, Morgan.

691
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,638
Jesus fucking Christ.
You're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

692
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,808
- I really hate that name.
- Jesus Christ, man.

693
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,018
You said that.

694
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:15,813
Always knew there was something with you.
But this shit?

695
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,149
What can I say?
You were right about me.

696
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,777
I never held it against you.

697
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,904
I don't now.

698
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,698
My buddies thought I was crazy
for becoming a cop.

699
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:28,201
I had skills.
I could have written my own ticket.

700
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,369
And lately, I thought
they might have been right.

701
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,497
But this...

702
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,499
This makes it all worth it.

703
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,127
- I'm happy for you.
- Shut the fuck up.

704
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,338
Let's get this over with.

705
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,258
Put them on.

706
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,596
Morgan, you're done. Give it up.

707
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,515
Would you in my position?

708
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,975
I wouldn't be in your position,
you sick fuck.

709
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,269
You sure about that?
You might want to check with Lundy.

710
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,148
You shoot me,
who will prove your innocence?

711
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:00,983
Maybe I'll just kneecap you.

712
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,586
All right. Nice and slow.

713
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:27,093
- Back the fuck off, Morgan!
- I'm just following your lead.

714
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,137
Slow down.

715
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,462
You're gonna have to kill me, Morgan!

716
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:50,134
You're gonna have
to fucking kill me, Morgan!

717
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,891
Morgan!
