1
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,380
Previously on Dexter

2
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,399
I was working on my piece

3
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,399
with the blowtorch

4
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,399
and it just caught on fire.

5
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,505
I was so scared.

6
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,710
We could always get in the car

7
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,375
and pass the time like we used to.

8
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,199
You're giving Doakes to the press.

9
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,460
He's not your man.

10
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,399
Your credibility was
compromised the second

11
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,899
you failed to report a phonecall

12
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,599
from the subject of
a goddamn FBI manhunt.

13
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,599
Who joined who in the
shower this morning?

14
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,199
How about in the future I set
the alarm 10 minutes earlier?

15
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,399
Future, i'm liking the sound of that.

16
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,499
A woman named Lila Tourney has filed

17
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,499
sexual assault charges against him.

18
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,725
That fuckin' bitch!

19
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,899
I could loose everything over this.

20
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,199
Lila, why can't you just let me go?

21
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,220
Because I'm your real soulmate.

22
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,230
Not Rita.

23
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,799
Jesus fuckin' Christ, you're
the Bay Harbor Butcher.

24
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,390
I really hate that name.

25
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,000
What's it gonna be, Morgan?

26
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,799
Kill me now, or set me free!

27
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,099
Don't worry I send the
FBI away soon enough.

28
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,599
You're still trying to frame me?

29
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,199
Mission accomplished. One more nail

30
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,370
in Doakes' coffin.

31
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,599
We got him.

32
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,199
So you have a tip, not Doakes.

33
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,799
The park manager said our target

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,899
was headed into the everglades.

35
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,599
We will have the son of a bitch

36
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,245
in handcuffs in 24 hours.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,485
Do not ever go to Rita's house again.

38
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,750
Stay away from Rita, stay away from me!

39
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,299
Whether you live on your own

40
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,299
or emigration haules your sorry ass away

41
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,599
I don't give a shit.

42
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,899
But I don't wanna give you one more day

43
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,340
to fuck with the people I care about.

44
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,745
Previous destinations.

45
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,999
They found Doakes' fuckin' rental car.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,099
Did they find Doakes?

47
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,999
No, not yet, but the
search grid's closing in.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,425
Hey, who's out there?

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,970
Anybody out there?

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,240
You've arrived at your destination.

51
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,770
Somebody in there?

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,535
Hello, who's out there?

53
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,360
I need some help.

54
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,760
Get me outa here!

55
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,140
Who are you?

56
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,070
Just open the door!

57
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,935
I'm being held captive.

58
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,299
Leave the mess for once!

59
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,890
Walk away from the mess!

60
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,599
You know I can't do that.

61
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,699
We need you. Lundy is mobilizing

62
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,299
every agency in five counties.

63
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,199
We're closing in.

64
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,399
You have a rental car,
you don't have Doakes yet.

65
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,295
God, come on!

66
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,999
I'm only helpful if there's blood.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,480
Maybe we'll shoot him.

68
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,299
Then you'll need a paramedic not me.

69
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,420
You're afraid of to face Doakes?

70
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,440
Yes, of course I'm afraid to face him.

71
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,199
And I have dishes to do.

72
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,840
Fine, I'll let you know when it's over.

73
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,095
It's Doakes, you fucking hate the guy.

74
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,799
I used to, I can't even afford to think

75
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,600
of him as a person anymore.

76
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,925
Would you get going?

77
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,075
I tried.

78
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,999
If they find Doakes locked inside a cage

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,615
it will seriously
undermine my frame job.

80
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,475
I need to beat them to that cabin.

81
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,799
Waiting out there in the everglades

82
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,199
there are hordes of county sheriffs

83
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,560
search parties and gravinous reptiles.

84
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,699
And in this corner
of wearing dark trunks

85
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,870
the mighty Dexter.

86
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,340
Drive much!

87
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,660
I need a miracle.

88
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,860
There's a switch.

89
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,210
Right behind you on the wall.

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,385
Damn, it's good to see another face.

91
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,390
I never thought I would.

92
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,475
I'm Sergeant James Doakes. Miami

93
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,460
Metro Homicide.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,370
Who put you in that?

95
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,615
A fuckin' psycho.

96
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,030
And he could be back in any minute.

97
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,115
Grab that key right
behind you on the wall.

98
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,930
Who is he?

99
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,700
He's name is Dexter Morgan.

100
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,155
I need you to open this gate.

101
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,999
Why would he do that? You even...

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,199
Because I found out that he's

103
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,599
the Bay Harbor Butcher.

104
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,895
Please, just open this fuckin' gate!

105
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,760
He's the butcher?

106
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,675
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

107
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,505
What's in there?

108
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,710
Exactly what you think it is.

109
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,750
It's evidence.

110
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,770
And I saw it happen.

111
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,015
I really need to get
out of this cage, lady.

112
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,835
Poor thing, all alone.

113
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,775
I'm okay.

114
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,699
Just open the gate!

115
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,760
Not you, Dexter.

116
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,445
Such an enormous secret.

117
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,399
One, there has got to be.

118
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,355
No wonder he is so shut down.

119
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,165
What are you? His accomplice?

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,850
His soulmate.

121
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,799
You can't leave me in here like this.

122
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,335
You'll be in excessory.

123
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,335
I'm not gonna leave you.

124
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,250
Not like that.

125
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,935
The fuck are you doing?

126
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,255
What the fuck are you doing?

127
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,670
No, turn it off, no!

128
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,565
Doing this is thing is murder.

129
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,090
Open this fuckin' door!

130
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,590
This is fuckin' murder!

131
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,265
m-
o-t-h-a

132
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,465
f-
u-c-k-a

133
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,299
Hey, Dexter Morgan,

134
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,900
Miami Metro PD Forensics.

135
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,299
I'm here to join the search for the

136
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,470
Bay Harbor Butcher

137
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,999
Search is on hold right now

138
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,185
until they sort out the confusion.

139
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,160
Confusion, huh?

140
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,980
Yeah, it's a real mess.

141
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,499
Take a right at the fork

142
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,060
park outside the line of the firetrucks.

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,830
Confusion requires firetrucks?

144
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,150
When something beyond reason happens

145
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,585
it turns sceptics into believers.

146
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,510
Believers in a higher power.

147
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,820
But what kind of power did this?

148
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,499
How the hell did you get here so fast?

149
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,899
I just got here and took
a helicopter with Lundy.

150
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,910
I broke a lot of speed limits.

151
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,899
After you left I realized you were right

152
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,965
I didn't wanna miss the action.

153
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,105
What happened?

154
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,595
They think a propaine tank exploded.

155
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,410
How?

156
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,385
Do I look like a fuckin' firechief?

157
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,660
They find a body?

158
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,255
Just bits and pieces so far.

159
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,675
Was it spontaneous combustion?

160
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,935
Divine intervention?

161
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,899
If you believe that God makes miracles

162
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,399
you have to wonder if Satan has a few

163
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,350
up his sleeve.

164
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,799
But when you don't believe in anything

165
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,340
who do you think got a time like this?

166
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,860
We got a floater.

167
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,170
He got the left off.

168
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:07,995
Separation.

169
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,499
Gaping area is a pultrified tissue.

170
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,375
Extensive fourth degree burns.

171
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,155
Big ass fuckin' explosion.

172
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,445
What else can you give us?

173
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,160
These lines around
his eyes aren't burnt.

174
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,205
He was squinting. Alive when happened.

175
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,285
What else.

176
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,499
Teething intact. Dental record

177
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,410
should give us a positive ID.

178
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,975
Goddamn it Masuka, is it Doakes?

179
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,745
Male, african american.

180
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,165
About the right length torso.

181
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,515
Heavyly muscled.

182
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,505
I think it's him.

183
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,199
This are the same kind of tools

184
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,010
that scuba dive class found.

185
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,199
He'd need them to make

186
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,260
cuts that clean.

187
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,799
Those come from the suspect?

188
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,975
No, they belong to a second body.

189
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,570
And whoever he was,

190
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,355
he was dead and dismembered

191
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,735
before the explosion.

192
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,699
So this is where the butcher

193
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,970
did his dirty work.

194
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,199
It's a perfect location

195
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,470
for a killing room.

196
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,399
It doetsn't get any more

197
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,515
remote than this.

198
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,005
No, it couldn't.

199
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,899
This is good news gentlemen.

200
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,530
And lady.

201
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,215
Right. All right.

202
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,299
We keep the search on

203
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,499
until we get a firm ID

204
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,245
on that body in the water.

205
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,725
You agree with them?

206
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,510
The evidence is compelling.

207
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,245
Overwhelming actually.

208
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,380
Guess, we got our man.

209
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,955
Oh, shit! Laguerta is here.

210
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,895
Lieutenant!

211
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:56,610
Ah..

212
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,235
I wouldn't if I were you.

213
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,440
Is it James?

214
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,060
We don't know yet.

215
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,050
Apparently miracles are subjective.

216
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,499
I can't exactly feel Laguerta's pain

217
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,090
but I can appreciate it.

218
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,565
Doakes wasn't so bad in the end.

219
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,299
But the truly tragic thing would be

220
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,475
to let his sacrifice go to waste.

221
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,099
There is only one way

222
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,000
I can think of to honor him.

223
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,310
I have to embrace my freedom.

224
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:38,920
Sleep.

225
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,105
What a concept!

226
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,499
I can't believe I actually

227
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,430
contemplated turning myself in.

228
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,460
This is so much better
than a prison cell.

229
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,330
I can squeeze fresh orange juice.

230
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,455
Savour a fine french roast.

231
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,990
Grab a morning work out.

232
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,599
Okay working out I could

233
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,599
have done in prison.

234
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,275
Let's go.

235
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,475
I'm free.

236
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,575
Dexter.

237
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,965
Sorry. Hope I didn't scare you.

238
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,210
What are you doing out there?

239
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,799
I forget the kids are still asleep

240
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,755
I didn't wanna ring the bell.

241
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,560
Why are you here?

242
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,785
I forgot the kids are still asleep.

243
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,630
That was.

244
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,495
Unexpected.

245
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,099
Yeah, wanted out of some

246
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,800
unexpected time on my ass.

247
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,035
Like 20 years to house.

248
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,899
I don't know if this is a

249
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,015
good idea Dexter.

250
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,999
I was just getting used

251
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,535
to you from a distance.

252
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,875
I know. You've been like a mirage.

253
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:45,400
-

254
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,010
You're the one that went away.

255
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,340
Yeah, I did.

256
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,190
I kinda forgot who I was.

257
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,380
I got it straight now.

258
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,915
Keep it straight.

259
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,920
Or there won't be your next time.

260
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,440
I know that.

261
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,210
Mom!

262
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,270
It's the sex police.

263
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,699
How come, you're still in bed?

264
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,495
I overslept.

265
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,330
Will you make us pancakes please?

266
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,070
What's under there?

267
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:27,865
Um...

268
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,365
Ow...

269
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:37,555
Hi!

270
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,040
Hi, Dexter!

271
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,955
Are you guys back together?

272
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,950
I guess we are.

273
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,365
Over.

274
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,275
Under..

275
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,730
Over...

276
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,520
Under.

277
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,299
Let me do myself!

278
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,560
No, I wanna do it.

279
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,060
I'm gonna be late.

280
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,210
So what? The case is closing.

281
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,799
I still need confirmation

282
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,860
on Doakes' body.

283
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,550
And if it's him?

284
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,350
Then it's over.

285
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,190
The case, not us, right?

286
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,399
We still have the wrap up to do.

287
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,800
Cataloging, conforming.

288
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,580
Filing, more filing.

289
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,250
So we got time?

290
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:39,975
Plenty.

291
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,255
Time enough for a vacation?

292
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,625
Now, you're talking.

293
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,860
Toes in the sand.

294
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,430
Tequila.

295
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,980
Little teeny bikini.

296
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,215
How about a parka?

297
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,520
A what?

298
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,935
I've had my fill of heat.

299
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,295
No more heat.

300
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,845
You look great in a parka.

301
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,530
Ever heard of the lake Hyppowash?

302
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,525
Can't say that I have.

303
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,890
Wonderful icefishing.

304
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,405
Very romantic.

305
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,665
Fine.

306
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,775
Fuck it.

307
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,595
Let's just go.

308
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,799
Morning, Dex.

309
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,385
Doughnut?

310
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,399
I'm uh, not really feeling

311
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,699
my doughnuts today, Dex.

312
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,799
You know what I mean...

313
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,430
Uh... no?

314
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,895
Oh... Right.

315
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,115
Mmmm, doughnuts!

316
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,015
Hey, are you free?

317
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,399
Vince, you have no idea.

318
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:46,765
Good.

319
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,199
How 'bout a dozen boxes

320
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,999
of burnt out shipment

321
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,910
from the cabin to catalog in?

322
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:58,599
Lieutenant.

323
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,799
Special Agent Lundy,

324
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,199
I was just looking more closely

325
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,699
at the dates of James' special

326
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,090
forces missions and...

327
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,299
We have a positive ID on the body.

328
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:06,720
And...

329
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,499
There may be and additional

330
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,799
date, which puts him out of the country.

331
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,095
The burnt victim is Sergeant Doakes.

332
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,265
Dental records confirmed it.

333
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,770
And the other body?

334
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,585
Jose Garza

335
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,099
A murder fugitive who has

336
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,999
been living under the alias

337
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,850
Chris Harlow.

338
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,900
The body was dismembered.

339
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,740
Consistent with our other victims.

340
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,970
Deputy director Adams is closing the case.

341
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:38,965
I see.

342
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,295
Lieutenant.

343
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,699
All the evidence points to

344
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,205
James Doakes as the Bay Harbor Butcher.

345
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,105
Conclusively.

346
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,399
I wanted you to

347
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,880
hear it from me first.

348
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,505
I'm truly sorry.

349
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,999
I don't know why they keep

350
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,799
hauling crap from the

351
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,750
cabin in here.

352
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,655
We know what we need to know.

353
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,965
Doakes was a suicidal maniac.

354
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,699
I believe the term is homicidal

355
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,665
maniac. Not that I am judging.

356
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,570
Yeah, whatever Morgan. He blew himself up.

357
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,799
That's what I'm saying.

358
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,999
I thought I heard somebody say

359
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,499
the explosion was a propaine accident.

360
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,540
Right. Doakes accidentally turned

361
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,399
on the propaine valve

362
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,699
and then he accidentally

363
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,999
turned the stove on.

364
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,160
The stove was on?

365
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,599
It was in the official

366
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,905
fire investigage report this morning.

367
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,230
I mean...

368
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,399
I guess it could be that Doakes

369
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,099
didn't realize fire and gas are a bad combo.

370
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,955
But, my money is on suicide.

371
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,880
A bad ass like Doakes?

372
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,485
Would rather burn then get burned.

373
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,699
It's a good line for my movie.

374
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,999
I better write it down.

375
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,999
You're writing a movie about Doakes?

376
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,950
Like you know?

377
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,710
Rather burn then get burned.

378
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,010
...

379
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,099
I just checked, I didn't see

380
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,499
any GPS device in the minivan, Dexter.

381
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,099
Did you check the glovebox?

382
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,635
It's a grey rectangular

383
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,350
it's about the size of a paperback book.

384
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,299
No, it wasn't there.

385
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,799
I even looked under the seats.

386
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,299
You think someone stole it?

387
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,960
Maybe. Thanks Rita, I'll see you tonight.

388
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,999
If someone stole my GPS

389
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,599
it would have let them straight to Doakes.

390
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,699
Who do I know with a nasty

391
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,870
habit of stealing?

392
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,655
Lila... My miracle worker.

393
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,345
Looks peaceful in there.

394
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,385
Doesn't it?

395
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,015
Glad, you called.

396
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,785
I was afraid, maybe you'd left town.

397
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,899
Seems I found a good reason to stay.

398
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,520
I won't.

399
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,760
And your victim.

400
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,205
You mean you...

401
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,499
That's why you asked to meet

402
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,530
at the aquarium. Public place...

403
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,705
others around.

404
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,440
I won't slip my needle into your neck.

405
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,025
Is that how you do it?

406
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,170
It's one of the ways.

407
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,930
You're afraid of me now, aren't you?

408
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,785
Who has been afraid of you, Dexter?

409
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:32,710
Why?

410
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,599
The first time I saw you

411
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,899
I could see how hopelessly

412
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,865
consumed you are by your need.

413
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,550
You lied to me.

414
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,355
All that time as my sponsor.

415
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,399
You said all you wanted was to

416
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,265
help me control my addiction.

417
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,499
Would you control it?

418
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,730
That's not what you really wanted.

419
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,520
Was it?

420
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,300
What do you think I wanted?

421
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,480
To know what it's like.

422
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,920
To feel something that deeply.

423
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,185
Anything.

424
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,515
That's why you hang
out in recovery groups.

425
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,875
You're emotionally colorblind.

426
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,299
You use the right words

427
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,385
you pantomime the right behaviour

428
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,040
but the feelings never come to pass.

429
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,495
It's not true.

430
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,785
It is Lila.

431
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,499
You know the dictionary definition

432
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,640
of emotions. Longing, joy, sorrow.

433
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,199
But you have no idea

434
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,499
what any of those things

435
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,725
actually feel like.

436
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,295
You're wrong. I have feelings for you.

437
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,099
You wanna have feelings for me

438
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,499
but they are just impulses.

439
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:50,975
Enough.

440
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,699
They are primitive responses

441
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,999
to immediate needs you know

442
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,860
all the words but you can't hear the music.

443
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:57,465
Lila.

444
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,260
I'm just like you.

445
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,210
Hey!

446
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,045
I was down to my last hope.

447
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,375
So was I.

448
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,000
And he told me, who you are.

449
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,480
I thought that was a secret worth protecting.

450
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,760
Most definetly.

451
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,940
Wish you could have seen it, Dexter.

452
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,980
The explosion was...

453
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,340
brilliant.

454
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,095
More like my father I've ever imagined

455
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,320
I've created a monster of my own.

456
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,630
Told you.

457
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,400
We're meant to be together.

458
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,150
Lila, I'm sorry

459
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,415
I pushed you away.

460
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,499
I know how frightening it

461
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,035
must have been for you.

462
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,465
I've been scratching to get in.

463
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,935
But it's okay. I'm in now.

464
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,400
And I'm not going anywhere.

465
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,310
I am.

466
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,399
Even with Doakes gone

467
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,099
I'm starting to think it's

468
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,800
too dangerous for me here.

469
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,220
I need to move on, to disappear.

470
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,699
I've already said my goodbyes.

471
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,125
Let me come with you.

472
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,500
I was hoping you'd say that.

473
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,799
How long would it take you

474
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,695
to get ready?

475
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,725
To close my accounts

476
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,815
shut my business.

477
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,980
Tomorrow afternoon.

478
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,260
Go home and pack!

479
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,235
I'll call you tomorrow.

480
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,799
I can't wait to go away

481
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,915
with you, Dexter.

482
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,540
I can't wait.

483
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,285
You're going away with me all right.

484
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,960
In a garbage bag.

485
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,180
But it went all right?

486
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,880
Sure for an internal affairs investigation.

487
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,955
I spent two hours saying: no

488
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,155
I did not rape Lila Tourney.

489
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,265
She's bad shit, nuts, wacko

490
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,799
I started to run out of adjectives.

491
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,590
I got a few you could use.

492
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,999
The good news is, the department

493
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,855
is dying to drop the charge.

494
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,999
They are dodging off bullets

495
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,799
with this whole Doakes thing.

496
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,399
Good. So when they find out

497
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,999
your so called victim fled Miami

498
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,380
You'll be reinstated.

499
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,005
Lila went away?

500
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,325
She fuckin' better.

501
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,899
I droped by her house last night

502
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,099
and told her to haul her sluggish

503
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,499
ass out of town before she's deported.

504
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,395
To defend me?

505
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,410
'course. For you and for Dex.

506
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,380
You to window lookers

507
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,195
needed somebody to snap you out of it.

508
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,899
It's good to know someone's

509
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,075
pulling for you when you're down.

510
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,380
Okay. I get the point.

511
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,399
Are you sure Lila got the message?

512
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,415
Yeah, totally...

513
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,635
I made it pretty clear.

514
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,395
Excuse me...

515
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,999
Donations can be made directly to me.

516
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,899
Donations, for Sergeant Doakes'

517
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,970
memorial service.

518
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,180
You gotta be kidding.

519
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,085
This what we do to a fellow officer.

520
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,850
Thanks again.

521
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,890
Excuse me, lieutenant.

522
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,770
I was wondering...

523
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,690
Checks payable to cash.

524
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,399
Actually I just wanted to

525
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,110
offer my support, sympathy.

526
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,885
Whatever the fuck if you wanna talk

527
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,620
Thank you Morgan, I can manage.

528
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,099
I'm not so sure...

529
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,730
I mean...

530
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,415
You're collecting money to honor a killer.

531
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,999
I'm not honoring the Butcher.

532
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,700
I'm honoring James Doakes.

533
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,940
Respectfully Maria, that's denial.

534
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,075
So it is.

535
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,599
You're choosing to be in denial?

536
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,670
Conscious denial.

537
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,799
But the case is closed.

538
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,435
I'm not gonna pursue it.

539
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,300
But I knew James, I knew him

540
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,655
as a partner and as a friend.

541
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,599
And I have to keep on believing

542
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,899
that that is who he was.

543
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,170
Because if he could

544
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,399
pile all that other fucked up shit

545
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,199
I don't think I could ever...

546
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,590
...trust anyone again.

547
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,695
That's right.

548
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,695
Or yourself.

549
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,975
I'll leave a check in your office.

550
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,595
Strange to have a creation out there.

551
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,050
A deeply mutated version of yourself.

552
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,099
Running loose and

553
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,545
screwing everything up.

554
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,740
I wonder if this is how parents feel.

555
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,465
Lila!

556
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,465
Lila!

557
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,750
What the fuck?

558
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,110
Dex!

559
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,699
What are you doing here?

560
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,030
I came to make sure Lila left town.

561
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,395
Yeah, me too.

562
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,799
And if she was still here you

563
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,799
were gonna what?

564
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,025
Wrestle her? Jesus!

565
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,140
Whopy here.

566
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,215
The door was open.

567
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,399
I just stepped out to

568
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,630
buy some snacks for the road trip.

569
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,525
Come to say goodbye?

570
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,099
Actually we came to see

571
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,690
that you're cleared out.

572
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,599
But now that we see you're

573
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
on your way we're good to go.

574
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,145
Have a nice fuckin' life!

575
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,099
You're not coming with me then?

576
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,890
Oh my god! What did you do

577
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,605
to make her so patheticly crazy for you?

578
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,480
Is it your dick dance?

579
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,250
Oh well, okay.

580
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:23,610
Um..

581
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,045
I better be on my way then.

582
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,325
I think that's my bag.

583
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,599
I must have left it
last time I was here.

584
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,655
No, I'm pretty sure it's mine.

585
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,199
I could open it up for you

586
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,695
if you like so you can check yourself.

587
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,370
No, it's my mistake.

588
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,465
Okay.

589
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,050
Good bye then.

590
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,470
Have a nice flight!

591
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,090
Don't forget your broom!

592
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,570
Hello, this is Lila

593
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,399
please leave your name and number

594
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,899
and I will bring you
back as soon as I can.

595
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,299
Lila, where are you? I'm ready

596
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,405
to hit the road.

597
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,599
Hope you're not mad about

598
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,999
that thing with Deb, I had to lie

599
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,999
I don't want her to know we're

600
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,335
running off together.

601
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,370
Call me right away.

602
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,485
I miss you.

603
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,320
Frank!

604
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,230
Bedroom.

605
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:15,999
What are we doing at home

606
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,299
in the middle of the day?

607
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,000
She asked, hoping for sex.

608
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,190
You're packing already.

609
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,845
Good thing i got my touqe.

610
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,199
Debra, slow down.

611
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,780
Oh wait, I got a parka.

612
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,599
Do you know how hard it is

613
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,290
to find a parka in Miami?

614
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,360
When do we leave?

615
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,485
Not we. Me.

616
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,120
Debra, I just got a call from DC.

617
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,205
A pat on a body was identified in Oregon.

618
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,765
My flight leaves tonight at 7.

619
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,499
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

620
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,495
I wish I were.

621
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,760
But it's too soon.

622
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,599
If you're leaving we gotta

623
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,825
work out logistics.

624
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,150
Logistics...

625
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,450
Yeah. We got a lot of shit to figure out.

626
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,399
Weekend visits and regular flights

627
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,000
and frequent flier plans.

628
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,415
I got my calendar.

629
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,165
Hey..

630
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,505
Do you honestly wanna 
go down this path?

631
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,870
You're right I don't.

632
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,899
Long distance relationships never

633
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,075
work out. Not even in the movies.

634
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,475
Fuck it!

635
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,470
What are you doing?

636
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:34,940
Logistics.

637
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,000
Taking a leave of absence.

638
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,930
You're not thinking this through.

639
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,199
What's to think about?

640
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,675
I'm going with you. It's just a job.

641
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,745
It's more than that to you.

642
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,515
Okay I love my job.

643
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,850
But not as much as I 
love being with you.

644
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,525
Just. Do me a favour.

645
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,160
Take the afternoon 
and think about this.

646
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,065
Fine.

647
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,799
You do me a favour and buy me a goddamn

648
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,235
ticket on your flight.

649
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm going home to pack and 
I'll see you at the airport.

650
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,725
That was delicious.

651
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,999
Yeah, what you like better

652
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,210
???

653
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,310
???

654
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,135
Can we have some snack?

655
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:45,620
????!

656
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,220
No running in the house please!

657
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,670
Yeah, real mature.

658
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,730
Captain!

659
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,399
You called for me?

660
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,405
Oh, hey Dexter!

661
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,499
Yeah, I recieved a phonecall from

662
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,699
a woman says she's a friend of yours.

663
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,010
Who?

664
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,100
She wouldn't give her name.

665
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,899
But claims to have vital information

666
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,399
on the Bay Harbor Butcher.

667
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,145
Any idea who she might be?

668
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,160
English accent?

669
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,985
That's her!

670
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,535
I think she might have a 
personal issue with me.

671
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,120
This is the same woman who tried

672
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,000
You might wanna avoid her.

673
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,995
Not a chance.

674
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,599
Now this case is closing

675
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,999
and I can't afford to 
leave any loose ends.

676
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,299
She said she was coming in?

677
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,199
Whithin the hour.

678
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,399
And you said she mentioned my name.

679
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,205
Specifically.

680
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,299
Well, stick around!

681
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,960
We'll sort this thing 
out together. Okay?

682
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,599
If Lila plans to turn me in

683
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,599
why would she drop my name

684
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,099
to the captain and give me a chance

685
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,705
to intercept her? It doesn't make sense.

686
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,299
Unless she wants me here

687
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,575
so she can hurt me some other way.

688
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,165
Rita.

689
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,520
Astor!

690
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,465
Cody!

691
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,065
Guys!

692
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,365
Lexy!

693
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:27,765
Lexy!

694
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,870
Where are the kids?

695
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,060
I can't remember.

696
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:32,875
Dexter!

697
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,499
I got your message what is it? 
What's going on?

698
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,825
The kids are missing

699
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,005
I'm so sorry, I didn't 
mean to fall asleep.

700
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,500
We have to call the police.

701
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,299
Call Deb, she'll have the entire force

702
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,199
looking for them.

703
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,799
You see if any of the 
neighbours saw anything.

704
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,199
I'll drive around the area.

705
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,945
I promise we'll find them.

706
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,535
We're going to terminal 
7 Miami International.

707
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:58,599
Morgan.

708
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,760
Debra, it's Rita.

709
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,699
Hey, I'm just, I'm getting in a cab.

710
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,830
Look, Cody and Astor are missing.

711
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,099
Did you call the police?

712
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,690
Dexter said to call you.

713
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,865
Okay, you just sit by the phone

714
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,499
I take it from here.

715
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,185
All right.

716
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,125
Could you just wait?

717
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,075
You don't wanna go to the airport?

718
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,299
Of course I wanna go to the airport.

719
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,460
I just said wait!

720
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,760
For chrissake, honey, 
make up your mind!

721
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:24,710
Why?

722
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,665
Why do I have to make up my mind?

723
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,640
Goddamnit!

724
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:35,665
Here.

725
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,640
Hi, Dexter.

726
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,440
Hi, Dexter.

727
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,199
Hey, Dex.

728
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,599
Hey, guys, you're having fun?

729
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,245
Superfun! Lila's so nice.

730
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,350
Where is Lila?

731
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,795
I'm over here.

732
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,165
Couldn't we have it all Dexter?

733
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,675
Dexter!

734
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,620
Stay on the bed guys, don't move!

735
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,375
Dexter.

736
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,135
Look away, both of you!

737
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,615
Astor, you first!

738
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,720
You're gonna help your brother.

739
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,270
Go, run, find help!

740
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,299
Come on Dexter!

741
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,185
I can't fit.

742
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,365
Shit!

743
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,830
What do you remember from before?

744
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,120
You know, before we took you in.

745
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,730
Nothing.

746
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:03,565
Good.

747
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,250
Because what happened was too strong.

748
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,100
Son, it got into you truly.

749
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,199
And it's gonna stay there.

750
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,265
It's gonna make you wanna kill.

751
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,065
And you won't be able to stop it.

752
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,975
So I'm gonna be like this forever?

753
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:25,710
Yes.

754
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,425
You're gonna be okay.

755
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,430
I got you.

756
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,710
I'm so sorry about all of this.

757
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,555
It's over now. They are safe.

758
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,740
You're safe. That's all that matters.

759
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,175
Come on.

760
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:10,675
You two.

761
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,799
Secure the perimeter

762
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,999
and have the firechief come see me

763
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,635
as soon as he gets here.

764
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,345
Put out an APB on Lila West

765
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,860
aka Lila Tourney

766
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,280
suspected arsonists

767
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,170
5.7, black hair, 
pale like a fuckin' corpse.

768
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,990
Fuckin' corpse, got it.

769
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,099
You're wasting your time

770
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,099
she's not coming back.

771
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,099
Not after this.

772
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,399
Yeah, I wouldn't bet on it.

773
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,130
She won't.

774
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,725
She's a survivolist.

775
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,099
How did you know the kids were here?

776
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:37,899
One of the neighbours

777
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,499
saw them walking with a strange woman.

778
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,199
It wasn't much of a lead, but...

779
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,199
Lila has gone after everyone

780
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,570
that's close to you.

781
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:46,665
What?

782
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,099
It's pretty impressive. It seems

783
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,299
it wasn't too long ago

784
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,990
I was taking care of you.

785
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,545
I like it better this way.

786
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,850
I can see that.

787
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,399
Why is this man not on the way

788
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,725
to the hospital now?

789
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,199
I'm fine, Deb.

790
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:00,999
You're not fine.

791
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,600
Your eyebrows are singed.

792
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,930
How can you be so fuckin' relaxed?

793
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,485
I'm good at compartmentalization.

794
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,845
You're little weird, Dex.

795
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,199
That's not gonna change

796
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,265
I'm gonna be this way, forever.

797
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,025
I can live with that.

798
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,135
Just mourn it up! Okay?

799
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,599
I passed through the flames

800
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,190
and rose from the ashes.

801
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,220
Again.

802
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,199
I've never been one to put much weight

803
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,999
to the idea of a higher power.

804
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,999
But if I didn't know better

805
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,499
I have to believe that some force

806
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,899
out there wants me to keep

807
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,325
doing what I'm doing.

808
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:49,975
Dexter.

809
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,099
You wanted to be close to me Lila.

810
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,320
This is the most I have to offer.

811
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,765
I can't feel my legs and my body.

812
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,199
Good. I went with a spinal epidural

813
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,555
instead the tranquilizer, 
I've got a plane to catch.

814
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,865
And you don't need to feel this.

815
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,755
You killed an innocent man.

816
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,805
I did it for you.

817
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,960
You tried to kill the 
children for me too.

818
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,195
Don't do this!

819
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,975
You taught me to accept what I am.

820
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,299
And to trust in the one thing

821
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,165
I know with absolute clarity.

822
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,785
Thank you.

823
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,399
Not long ago I had a dream

824
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,699
that people could see me for what I am.

825
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,399
And for a brief instant of time

826
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,060
the world actually 
saw my bodies of work.

827
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,270
Some even cheered.

828
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,080
But as it turns out, 
nobody mourns the wicked.

829
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,750
Sorry, James.

830
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,699
I think Harry knew that from the start.

831
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,399
That's why he gave me a code.

832
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,699
It cost him his life.

833
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,699
But it kept me alive

834
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,310
through incredible trials.

835
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,125
The code is mine now.

836
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,405
And mine alone.

837
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,115
So too are the relationships I cultivate.

838
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,040
They're not just disguises anymore.

839
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,440
I need them.

840
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,175
Even if they make me vulnerable.

841
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,499
My father might not approve.

842
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,565
But I'm no longer his disciple.

843
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,135
I'm a master now. 
An idea transcended into life.

844
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,445
And so this is my new path.

845
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,165
Which is a lot like the old one.

846
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,285
Only mine.

847
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,960
To stay on that path I 
need to work harder.

848
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,525
Explore new rituals

849
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:16,575
evolve.

850
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,470
Am I evil? Am I good?

851
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,775
I'm done asking those questions. 
I don't have the answers.

852
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,595
Does anyone?
