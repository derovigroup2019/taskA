1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,335
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:04,420
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,548
It doesn't change the fact
that you slept with another woman.

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,841
What do they have on me?

5
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,760
- They found something in your car.
- Oh, shit.

6
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:15,681
Our primary suspect
is someone you know well...

7
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,726
- Sergeant James Doakes.
- He had the slides.

8
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,436
You know me, Maria. That's not me.

9
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,229
Don't you disappear on me, James.

10
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,774
What exactly is Sergeant Doakes's
problem with you, Morgan?

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,195
I always sensed there was something...
off about him.

12
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:33,615
From here on out, we'll want
a protective detail on you at all times.

13
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,368
You're a good cop like your old man.

14
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,705
- Do you think they know?
- Not until you tell them.

15
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,373
He is not your man.

16
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,876
He may be your ex-partner,
he may be your best friend.

17
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,335
What he is to me is a suspect.

18
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,213
- Lila, what are you doing here?
- She came to see me, bro.

19
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,382
Are you pissed or something
about Lila and me?

20
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,052
- Lila's just using you to get at me.
- So what?

21
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,180
A secret cabin
in the middle of the Everglades...

22
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,391
What more could
a rededicated serial killer ask for?

23
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,605
Jesus Christ.
You're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

24
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,036
You're gonna have to kill me, Morgan!

25
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,291
You're gonna have
to fucking kill me, Morgan!

26
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,838
Is it deep? I hope it's fucking deep.

27
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,634
It's a graze wound. Minor tissue abrasion.

28
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,220
No hemorrhage along the bullet track.

29
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,971
Sorry. I think I'm gonna live.

30
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,557
Am I?

31
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,559
That's a good question.

32
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,480
If you're not gonna let me go, Morgan,
then kill me now, just get it over with.

33
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:55,609
I'd advise you not to tempt me just now.

34
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,743
Why couldn't you just leave me
to do my work in peace?

35
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,579
Why'd you have to go
and ruin everything?

36
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,206
You're a killer.

37
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,374
I catch killers.

38
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,918
So do I. I caught you.

39
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,878
I'm not a killer.

40
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,924
You are.

41
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,385
That's why you've always known what I am.

42
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,681
That's why you have more officer-related
shootings than anybody else.

43
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,600
Only I don't fuck with you
when you shoot somebody.

44
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,186
Why couldn't you pay me
the same professional courtesy?

45
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,647
There's nothing professional
about what you do.

46
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,691
I kill when I have to on the job.

47
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:40,279
Oh, so it's OK to take a life
as long as you get a paycheck for it?

48
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,572
The city pays me to keep the law.

49
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,450
I've got news for you, Sergeant.

50
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:50,414
My code requires a higher standard of proof
than your city's laws.

51
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,542
At zero cost to the taxpayer.

52
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,419
If you ask me, I'm a bargain.

53
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,380
That's enough bullshit, Morgan.

54
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,340
Let's get this over with.

55
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,343
Either kill me or set me free,
what's it gonna be?

56
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,596
I actually think you'd like it if I killed you,
just to prove your point.

57
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,308
- Morgan, you gotta choose.
- No, I need to go home.

58
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:13,228
I've got FBI guards standing outside my door
right now...

59
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,774
to protect me from you.

60
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,069
What's it gonna be, Morgan?

61
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,157
Morgan, what's it gonna be?
Kill me now or set me free!

62
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,367
You only have two choices, Morgan!

63
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,786
You can't fucking ignore me!

64
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,750
What's wrong?
The place is a ghost town this early.

65
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,835
Besides, I thought we were out as a couple.

66
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,755
Out and flaunting it are two different things.

67
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,508
- "Don't ask, don't tell"?
- Works for the military.

68
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,510
Not really.

69
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,765
Oh, excellent.

70
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:54,102
My subpoena for Doakes's
phone records came through.

71
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,647
- He isn't much of a talker.
- Not a lot of friends, I'm guessing.

72
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,776
Except for one. Check this out.

73
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,488
That's Lieutenant LaGuerta's number.
Look at the time and date.

74
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,240
Doakes called her
right after we launched the manhunt.

75
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,202
- We could have traced that call.
- Doubt it.

76
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,954
Sergeant Doakes wouldn't have stayed on
long enough,

77
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,208
but LaGuerta should have
given us the chance.

78
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,294
You're gonna ream her, aren't you?
Can I be there when you do it?

79
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,714
- It's kind of a hobby of mine.
- You can ream her yourself.

80
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,841
Me?

81
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,512
- I can't dress down my own boss.
- It's your subpoena.

82
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,639
- Your case.
- Our case.

83
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,934
And I need to know if your lieutenant
can be counted on.

84
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,644
You know her better than I do.

85
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,646
- Lox?
- Gross.

86
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:42,150
Seriously, that would get me in deeper shit
with her and LaGuerta already hates me.

87
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,904
You know, I'm not always gonna be around
to run interference.

88
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,489
Oh, come on.

89
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,367
You got at least five,
ten good years left in you.

90
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,955
I mean I won't be around
once this case ends,

91
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,625
so a reaming will be good practice for you after
I'm gone.

92
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,545
I better refrigerate this.

93
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,851
Taking a life is one thing,
but the care and feeding of it is another.

94
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,187
I can't keep my problem
locked away in a cabin forever.

95
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,819
Harry always said there were
plenty of people who deserved to die,

96
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:30,365
but no matter how hard I close my eyes
and wish, Doakes isn't one of them.

97
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,330
Harry, you never prepared me for this one.

98
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,958
What do I do?

99
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,127
What would you do?

100
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,298
Get a description of Juan Ryness
to every patrol unit,

101
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,966
and wake up Judge Morehouse.

102
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,427
I need a warrant for
Ryness's apartment immediately.

103
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,138
- Fisk, make sure you get that print...
- She was dumped?

104
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,932
Debra, get back inside the car
like I told you.

105
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,978
Blunt trauma to the head?

106
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,439
I went over there. No one saw.

107
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,361
The blow to the head killed her.
She took a brutal beating beforehand.

108
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,489
The guy who did this is an evil bastard.

109
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,741
- You know who it was?
- Oh, yeah.

110
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,495
I've been trying to nail him for a while.
A pimp named Juan Ryness.

111
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,163
She was one of his girls.

112
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,123
She was dumped, right?

113
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,083
Get back in the truck.

114
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,733
You awake?

115
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,860
You for real?

116
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,779
You got a visitor.

117
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,324
Coffee?

118
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,161
Yeah. Why not?

119
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,630
I heard the news. It's everywhere.

120
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,883
Sergeant Doakes is
the Bay Harbor Butcher?

121
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,927
That's what they're saying.

122
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,056
I was worried about you, Dexter.
Are you OK?

123
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,267
Why is the FBI guarding your building?

124
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,561
Oh, you know the federal government.

125
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,896
Any excuse to spend money.

126
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,942
It's cold.

127
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,735
Sorry.

128
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:36,533
Well, there's nothing better on a muggy Miami
morning than an iced coffee, right?

129
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,207
How are the kids?

130
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,420
They asked about you again.

131
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,632
And they've been pretty confused
since we split up.

132
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,011
Yeah. Me too.

133
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,221
Are you still confused?

134
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,433
I'm generally confused most of the time...

135
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,395
But not about us.

136
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,981
Good.

137
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,402
No.

138
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,238
It's not good?

139
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,742
No. It's great...

140
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,537
to have this...clarity.

141
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,626
I'm really glad you feel that way, Dexter.

142
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,503
Me and the kids
have been through so much lately

143
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,340
with Paul's death and my mom moving out...

144
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,761
I don't want them to feel like they've been
abandoned by everyone they love.

145
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,934
Does this mean we're dating again?

146
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,982
That would be kind of fast, wouldn't it?

147
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,862
I mean, you're so important to them
and they need you.

148
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,824
But I don't know.

149
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,995
I mean, maybe we could just...

150
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,789
hang.

151
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,334
Like a sloth.

152
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,877
I can do that.

153
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:18,885
Well, if you're free on Saturday,
we're gonna spend the day at the beach,

154
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,305
and maybe we could all hang together.

155
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,307
A family of sloths.

156
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,980
Let me get you some ice.

157
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,153
I've been selfish, only thinking about
what happens to me.

158
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,574
But if I were ever revealed
as the true Bay Harbor Butcher,

159
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,660
Rita and her children would be destroyed.

160
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,224
- Lieutenant?
- Yes, Morgan?

161
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,193
- I need you to take a look at these.
- I know what they are.

162
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,905
You didn't report the call from Doakes.

163
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:25,452
Your task force doesn't need
my help railroading a good cop.

164
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,039
Doakes was officially a person of interest.

165
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,917
Not reporting that call
could be aiding and abetting.

166
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:36,796
None of you wanted to hear
what he had to say, so I didn't tell you.

167
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,760
- What did he have to say?
- That he's innocent.

168
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,344
And you believe him?

169
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,474
What do you think?

170
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,935
And if he calls again?

171
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,520
He won't.

172
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,023
- And you know this...
- Because I know him.

173
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,445
- I thought I knew someone too.
- I know him.

174
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,949
So if Lundy wants to flag me to
Captain Matthews, you tell him to go for it.

175
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,243
But James knows that I believe in him,

176
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,204
so it was worth the risk.

177
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,747
To your job?

178
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,959
To your career?

179
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,587
You ever care about anyone, Morgan?

180
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,006
Yes.

181
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,636
Then you shouldn't have to ask.

182
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,222
'Cause when you care about someone,

183
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,932
you do what you have to do.

184
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:43,613
Four different aliases all issued by the DOD
during Doakes's stint with Special Forces.

185
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,324
We've attached these names
to our temporary felony want,

186
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,494
so if he uses one, we'll be notified.

187
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,120
I remember when life was easy,

188
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,123
when the only question I worried about
was "Who's next?"

189
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,918
Now it's "How can I dodge
my protective detail?

190
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,504
"What should I do with my hostage?"

191
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,090
These are not easy questions.

192
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:07,011
Morgan, would you bring us up to speed
on the analysis from the blood slides?

193
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,180
Of the 46 slides,

194
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,100
18 belonged to previously known
Butcher victims.

195
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:16,354
We're still running the DNA,
but we've matched an additional 12

196
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,315
with felons in the criminal database,
all reported missing.

197
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,695
We'll proceed on the assumption
that these 12 were Bay Harbor victims.

198
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,114
It's a fair assumption.

199
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:31,077
Officer Morgan,
do you have the new victims' jackets?

200
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,289
Sorry, sir. Not my responsibility.

201
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,250
That'd be me.

202
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:43,006
Each of the 12 had at least
one homicide on their records,

203
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,425
and we all know
how the Butcher loves a killer.

204
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,720
We're checking into
their last known whereabouts

205
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:53,057
and any connection that their criminal cases
may have had with Sergeant Doakes.

206
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,060
Forensics,
expect a steady stream of evidence

207
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:59,397
seized from our suspect's apartment
over the next few hours.

208
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,275
Look for any evidence
that could connect him to these victims.

209
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,736
The rest of you have your assignments.

210
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,863
Let's bring him in, folks.

211
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,660
Special Agent Lundy?

212
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,455
Dexter, is your sister all right?

213
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,290
I wouldn't know.

214
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,501
But I wanted to talk to you
about my protective detail.

215
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,175
Angel, I hear you have
12 new butcher victims.

216
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,551
Potential victims.

217
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,553
You got names?

218
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,850
Mind if I keep this?

219
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,895
We're all working together now.

220
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,688
Why? You got an angle on Doakes?

221
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,466
Oh, yeah. That's good.

222
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,301
That's real good.

223
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,428
This is a waste of time.

224
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,932
If Doakes is the Butcher, we're not gonna find
trace evidence on his clothes.

225
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,726
The guy we're after
is way too careful for that.

226
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,605
I have to agree with you there.

227
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,776
You think it could be Doakes?

228
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:30,029
It's not about what I think.
It's all about the evidence.

229
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:36,786
All those times he called me "lab geek,"
"fairy winkle," "donkey fluffer"...

230
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,040
I'm just glad I took it lying down, you know?

231
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,293
What the fuck, Dex?

232
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,837
What? Which fuck?

233
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,214
You told Lundy to pull your protective detail?

234
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,133
Oh, she's gonna hit you, isn't she?

235
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,136
She's gonna hit someone
if you don't get the fuck out of here.

236
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:57,682
Hair-pulling may not be manly,
but it's very effective.

237
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,021
Doakes fucking hates you, Dex.

238
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,440
- No doubt about that.
- And he's a trained killer.

239
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,984
If he wanted me dead,
it would have happened by now.

240
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,527
Is that supposed to be reassuring?

241
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,946
Doakes is a lot of things,
but he's not an idiot.

242
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,158
He won't come out of the shadows
because of a grudge.

243
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,534
Right.

244
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,911
'Cause serial killers are so practical.

245
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,039
Actually, they are.

246
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:25,543
Deb, I'm safer with Lundy's troops
hunting Doakes than baby-sitting me.

247
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,712
- Lundy agrees.
- Lundy doesn't give a shit!

248
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,506
All he cares about is solving this case
and moving on!

249
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,885
I thought he was the guy you could count on.

250
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,599
You are the only one I can count on, jackass.

251
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,102
Deb.

252
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,188
Got to give Deb credit for one thing,

253
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,356
she knows how to express her feelings.

254
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,404
If I was convicted as the Butcher,
she'd probably explode.

255
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,948
It'd be a waste of a perfectly good cop...

256
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,034
and sister.

257
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,205
This isn't just about me any more,
it's about Deb,

258
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,333
and Rita and the kids.

259
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,710
I have only one choice for Doakes.

260
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,183
Shit.

261
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,438
All right.

262
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,244
Yes.

263
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,115
No reason for you to suffer.

264
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,624
You come to a decision?

265
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,419
Yes, but I don't think
you're gonna like it.

266
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,927
So this is the way it ends.

267
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,681
Regardless of how we got here...

268
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,976
one of the two killers
in this cabin has to go away.

269
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,352
I am not a killer.

270
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,479
Right.

271
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:55,568
In terms of who goes,
it boiled down to a philosophical question...

272
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,031
which one of us has more inherent worth?

273
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,158
I know you're fucking kidding me.

274
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,495
First I considered our value
to the community. That was a wash.

275
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,208
We're both loyal civil servants.

276
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,960
We work hard to keep the city clean.

277
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,129
You cut people up into little pieces.

278
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:18,466
Then I looked at our personal lives.

279
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,510
And, well...

280
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,389
that's where the differences
became clearer.

281
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,600
Strange as it may seem,

282
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,561
I have people who depend on me.

283
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:35,191
They would be devastated
if they found out what I do.

284
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:40,905
You, Sergeant, you're more of a lone wolf,
easier to put down,

285
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,741
- no one in the pack to miss you.
- Fuck you.

286
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,745
Fuck you, Morgan. I have a family.
I have my mother and my sisters.

287
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,538
Who you never visit.

288
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,545
It puts a pit in my stomach...

289
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,840
that I can only interpret as...

290
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,552
sadness.

291
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,973
If you had a personal life,

292
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,849
you might not have made me
your obsession

293
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,476
and we wouldn't be here right now.

294
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,747
Sergeant, why would you hide
a dead drug dealer's cellphone from me?

295
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,166
You working on an exit strategy?

296
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,085
I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.

297
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,631
If you want to bring me down, Morgan,

298
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:44,302
you're gonna have to open
this goddamn cage first.

299
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,387
So come on. Bring it.

300
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,017
I already did. You just didn't know it.

301
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,025
Motherfucker.

302
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,068
The sedative works fast.

303
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,862
It's probably best just to go with it.

304
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,953
You think you're a fucking hero, don't you?
Cleaning up the fucking streets.

305
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,664
Your old man would be proud.

306
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,668
My old man was proud.

307
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,255
He knew?

308
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,259
He really was a fucking whack job.

309
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,680
Name-calling at this juncture?

310
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,932
What's the point?

311
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,727
Besides, my father was
a legend on the force.

312
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,645
Is that what you think?

313
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,067
They never told you.

314
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,196
Told me? Told me what?

315
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,157
Hey!

316
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,159
What about my father?

317
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,828
What about my father?

318
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,134
A missed call.

319
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,178
If it's Dexter, tell him to come over.

320
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,061
I have Auri on Saturday.

321
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,646
Auri? What's an auri?

322
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,190
It's my little girl.

323
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:25,236
My ex never lets me see her on
the weekends, but something came up.

324
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,363
I have her all day on Saturday.

325
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,408
Delightful.

326
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,577
But tonight you belong to me...

327
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,746
Yes.

328
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,164
...and my walls.

329
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,714
Doakes said I had two choices.
Kill him or let him go.

330
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,428
But he neglected to look
behind door number three...

331
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,763
hand him over to the FBI gift-wrapped.

332
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:58,811
I don't need Doakes dead, I just need
his fingerprints to complete my frame job.

333
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,072
Almost forgot.

334
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,411
One needs small comforts.

335
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:41,770
Every Saturday, beginning dive classes
practice underwater skills beside this dock.

336
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,774
Tomorrow they'll find
a morbid little surprise.

337
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,490
When the feds receive these kill tools
with their suspect's prints on them,

338
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:57,286
the only threat to me will be
the inane rants of a murderous madman.

339
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,127
So close, I can feel it.

340
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,766
This tragic tale might still end
in Doakes's demise,

341
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,851
but not by my hands.

342
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,229
Harry's legacy will remain intact.

343
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,689
Harry.

344
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,735
Why in the hell did Doakes
have to bring up Harry?

345
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,201
Come on.

346
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,789
You just cut the cake, sweetheart.

347
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,457
I'll see who it is.

348
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,796
Tom. This is a surprise. Come on in.

349
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,005
Oh, thanks.

350
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,133
Sweetheart, cut the lieutenant a slice.

351
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,761
- It's her birthday.
- Oh! Well, happy birthday, hon.

352
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,805
But no cake for me, thanks.

353
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:01,600
- Can I talk to you in private for a second?
- Sure.

354
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,185
Save me an end piece.

355
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,275
God damn it!

356
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:14,947
Ryness is gonna walk
because of a goddamn typo?

357
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,032
Faulty warrant, Harry. Nothing we can do.

358
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,659
- This is bullshit!
- Harry!

359
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,746
Now, look, don't worry.
Ryness will make another mistake.

360
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,791
Yeah, right. We just got wait for him
to kill another girl!

361
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,294
Sorry.

362
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,388
Happy birthday, kiddo.

363
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,686
I'll get the vacuum cleaner.

364
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,407
You OK, Dad?

365
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,621
I did the right thing in training you.

366
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,789
This just proves it.

367
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,208
I did the right thing.

368
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,966
Debra.

369
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,760
Will you wait?

370
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,889
- What's going on here?
- Nothing, according to you.

371
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,224
So I said something?

372
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,478
Only that this relationship
has an expiration date.

373
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:31,231
Hey, if you want to write it off
before it even begins, you go ahead.

374
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,566
When did I say that?

375
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:36,362
Yesterday morning, you said, "When the case
ends, we end." I'm paraphrasing.

376
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:41,659
Debra, I thought you understood
when we got involved.

377
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,620
I track killers. That's what I do.
They tend to move around.

378
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,455
I know that.

379
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:51,085
Then I'm not sure what you thought
would happen when the case ended.

380
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,547
Honestly, I hadn't thought about it,

381
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,550
but it looks like you have, so now I know.

382
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,636
Consider me informed.

383
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,896
One.

384
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,982
How come there's never a circus
when you need one?

385
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,985
I don't know. I'm not sure
I've ever felt that particular need.

386
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,656
Help me out here.

387
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:24,034
- What does a seven-year-old girl like?
- Astor likes CNN.

388
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,121
Yeah. That's not gonna fly.

389
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,581
I got Auri all day on Saturday.

390
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,084
I want to do something fun.

391
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,045
Ideally a lot more fun than the stuff
her mother does with her.

392
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,715
It's really not that hard to entertain a kid.

393
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,134
Rita and I are taking hers
to the beach on Saturday.

394
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,010
See, now, that sounds perfect.

395
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,389
It'd be great if we could tag along.

396
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,393
Sure, I guess.

397
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,437
We'll be there all afternoon.

398
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:59,194
- Sorry, but what's with the highlights?
- I was helping Lila paint her loft last night.

399
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,989
Red, the color of pasi?n.

400
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,742
Yeah. About Lila.

401
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:08,912
Uh, it's probably better for everyone
if she doesn't come along on Saturday.

402
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,081
Bro, I'm not stupid.

403
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,043
Lila is like my after-hours project.

404
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,755
Besides, she should stay off
the beach with skin like that.

405
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,466
Like a perfect porcelain doll.

406
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,599
"Paid 4 my lift ticket.
Where's my snow?

407
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,934
"Don't make me come after u."

408
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,146
Sounds like Mr. Harlow is
not only a master of metaphor,

409
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,607
but also inclined toward
violent confrontation.

410
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,401
Better find out who he is
in case I have to deal with him.

411
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,409
Armed with a phone number, obtaining
the mysterious text messenger's ID

412
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,745
wasn't too hard, but is he a threat?

413
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,542
Christopher Harlow.
Known alias for Jose Garza.

414
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,212
Narcotics, armed robbery,

415
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,298
and currently a fugitive
from justice for murder.

416
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,091
Approach with caution.

417
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,483
This guy could be trouble
if he has knowledge

418
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,819
of a certain cabin in the Everglades.

419
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,784
I'm safe.

420
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,703
Happy trails, Harlow.

421
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,758
Deb?

422
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,802
Fuck! Sneak much?

423
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,555
Sorry. I wanted to ask you something.

424
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,808
That is some big hair.

425
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,269
Hard to believe he's our guy.

426
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:59,231
Amazing how easy it is to hide
who you are from people, huh?

427
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,732
Not that easy.

428
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,822
I was thinking about your birthday.

429
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,782
You got, like, three months.

430
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,617
Just get me a gift certificate at Amazon.

431
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:14,037
Good to know, but the birthday
I was thinking about was...

432
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,373
when Dad threw the beer bottle.

433
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,294
Jesus.

434
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,339
Out of the blue, Dex.
What brought that up?

435
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,719
Harry's been on my mind lately.

436
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,762
I was trying to remember...

437
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,099
Matthews came over that night, right?

438
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,643
Yeah.

439
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,854
He and Dad got in a fight.

440
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,357
I ended up wiping beer off the walls.
Happy birthday to me.

441
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:47,321
A killer went free.
That would upset any cop, right?

442
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,907
Nothing weird about that.

443
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,535
No, it wasn't weird. It was
just another example of Dad's priorities.

444
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,079
Kids versus case. Case always won.

445
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,542
Did he say anything else about it to you?

446
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:02,961
Right.

447
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,923
Dad sitting down with me
to have a heart-to-heart.

448
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,758
Not that I didn't want to.

449
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,220
Maybe you should have told him that.

450
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,388
Yeah.

451
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,725
Maybe.

452
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,477
Deb had it rough.

453
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,355
Harry had his hands full
teaching me a trade.

454
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,651
But was there something else
going on with him,

455
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,862
or was Doakes just trying to shake me up?

456
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,365
I need to know if there's more to the story.

457
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,416
There's a complication I don't need.

458
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,046
Hey, baby, what brings you back?

459
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:50,509
I have two more walls at home
waiting for your expertise as a painter.

460
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,886
Oh, there's nothing
I'd like to do more, but...

461
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,473
But what, darling?

462
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,141
I'm picking up Auri, remember?

463
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:01,019
We're meeting Dexter and Rita
at the beach.

464
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,439
You know, I have a friend
at Miami Art Museum

465
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,275
teaches an incredible children's class.

466
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,443
Air-conditioned.

467
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,614
You could bring the whole gang if you like.

468
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,661
You mind if I take a rain check?

469
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:21,456
You know, with your history with Dexter,
it might be a little awkward.

470
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,667
He's trying to work things out with Rita.

471
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,462
Oh, is he now?

472
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:32,134
Well, you have a great day.

473
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,304
And watch out
for those sand fleas.

474
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,185
Damn. She better be worth it.

475
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,883
What was that shit last night?
Some kind of fucking scare tactic?

476
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:17,179
You said something before you passed out
about my father. What was it?

477
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:21,433
I don't know. What was it?
I was kind of drugged at the time.

478
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,020
Don't test me, Sergeant.

479
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,481
I could have killed you.

480
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,900
I didn't.

481
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,070
You didn't because you can't.

482
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,031
I've had time to think about this, Morgan.

483
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,618
I don't fit that code
you were talking about, do I?

484
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,081
At first I thought the Butcher
only went after criminals

485
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:47,417
because nobody gives a goddamn
what happens to 'em, but now...

486
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,711
now I think you got a conscience.

487
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,671
Of course I have a conscience.

488
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,550
I left you a place to shit, didn't I?

489
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,768
It's a small conscience.

490
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,937
You're actually angry.

491
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,815
I've never seen you angry, Morgan.
This is good.

492
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,776
I might live to see the outside
of this goddamn cabin after all.

493
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,862
What'd you say about Harry?
The words "whack job" were involved.

494
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,405
Oh, yeah.

495
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,285
Is that what you're worried about, man?

496
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:25,288
I guess it would bother me, too,
if it were my old man.

497
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,082
Sergeant.

498
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,709
OK. What the fuck?

499
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,674
You know how I've been looking
into your past, right?

500
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,759
That's why you're in a cage.

501
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,638
I found something
I wasn't supposed to see.

502
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,808
It's about your father's death.

503
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,310
Heart disease, big mystery.

504
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,813
No, the mystery's bigger than that.

505
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,150
And someone up high didn't want it solved.

506
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,696
You're lying.

507
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,825
It was buried deep, but it was there.

508
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,787
What was there?

509
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:16,131
How about we go outside and talk about this,
man? I could use some air.

510
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:23,138
- Not gonna happen.
- Yeah, well, then the mystery remains.

511
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:37,068
I'm sure special ops taught you
to rattle your captor,

512
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:41,823
but I should warn you, Sergeant,
you can't play on my feelings.

513
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,993
I don't have any.

514
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,787
Oh, really?

515
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,081
Who's lying now?

516
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:02,177
Sit down. That's it.

517
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,434
Well.

518
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,895
Hello, Dexter.

519
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:15,315
- Captain.
- Please. I'm a civilian today. Call me Tom.

520
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,485
You start your round yet?

521
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,490
I'm afraid Bayshore is
a little outside my pay scale.

522
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,869
So, what brings you all the way
out here on a Saturday morning?

523
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:32,457
I want to know if there was anything unusual
about my father's death.

524
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,045
Go on ahead. I'll catch up.

525
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,052
His heart gave out. You know that.

526
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,054
I heard there was more to it.

527
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,180
From whom?

528
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,683
Does it matter?

529
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,564
I guess it was inevitable
you'd find out one of these days.

530
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,609
You know, Harry was a good friend.

531
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,778
He was a great cop.

532
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,154
But...

533
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,949
it's a tough job.

534
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,201
It can wear on even the best of us.

535
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:13,915
- My father was always firmly in control.
- That he was, but towards the end...

536
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,752
Look, Dexter.

537
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,838
The system doesn't always work.

538
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,341
Sometimes they get away.
You know that.

539
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:28,096
And that just got harder and harder
for Harry to deal with.

540
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,266
I think that's what did him in in the end.

541
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,685
What did?

542
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,109
What am I missing here?

543
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,866
He killed himself, Dexter.

544
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,787
How?

545
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,875
The autopsy showed an overdose
of his heart medicine.

546
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,340
That happens all the time.
People accidentally take the wrong dose.

547
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,884
He called me the day before he died.

548
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,054
He asked me to keep an eye
on you and your sister.

549
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,474
I didn't realize what that call meant
until he was gone.

550
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,978
So I made sure that autopsy
never saw the light of day.

551
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:21,191
I was looking out for the two of you
like I said I would.

552
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,657
I'm sorry, Dexter.

553
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,373
Listen, why don't we go to the club
and have a drink? We can talk some more.

554
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,707
No.

555
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,543
Thank you.

556
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,384
The legendary Harry Morgan,

557
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,720
force for justice, architect of all that I am.

558
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,889
Suicide.

559
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,141
It doesn't make sense.

560
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,482
Special Agent Lundy.

561
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,110
I have good news.

562
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,986
I could use it. What do you got?

563
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:11,533
Proof that James Doakes
can't possibly be the Bay Harbor Butcher.

564
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,745
You're looking at
the documentation of a stakeout

565
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:19,332
that James and I were on
as partners seven years ago.

566
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,168
Very detailed.

567
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:26,047
We were doing surveillance when one of your
victims, Larry Mueller, went missing.

568
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:30,343
James and I were holed up
in a motel room 24/7 for two weeks.

569
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:34,305
He didn't have time to piss,
much less abduct and murder a man.

570
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,563
I respect your compassion
for a friend and colleague...

571
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,233
but I'm afraid this proves nothing.

572
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,279
No, it proves that he was with me.

573
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:54,576
It's all here, specific dates and times.
These are my personal stakeout logs.

574
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:58,788
And they're very thorough,
but I can't use them.

575
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,834
No. No. This is bullshit.

576
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,671
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
You can't just ignore legitimate evidence.

577
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,134
I can, and I will ignore it
because you gave me no choice, lady.

578
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:15,013
Those are your personal logs,
and your credibility was compromised

579
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,639
the second you failed to report a phone call

580
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,934
from the subject
of a goddamn FBI manhunt.

581
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,103
It was a breach of protocol and ethics,

582
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,439
and you're lucky
I don't bring you up on charges.

583
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,819
What really pisses me off
is you might be right.

584
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,821
But in trying to protect your friend,

585
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:35,116
you blew the best shot we had
of bringing him in from the cold.

586
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,413
Come back to me
if you find evidence I can use.

587
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,964
I smell...monster meat!

588
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,223
I got you!

589
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,105
I tagged you.

590
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,690
So?

591
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,400
So you're a monster now.

592
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,237
- Really?
- Yeah.

593
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,656
Come on, socio. I'm sucking gas here.

594
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,992
Sorry, Angel. My leg's a little tight today.

595
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,838
It's too soon, isn't it?

596
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,132
For this.

597
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,551
For us.

598
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,052
No.

599
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,973
Rita, that's not it at all.

600
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,809
Then what is it?

601
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,062
Dexter?

602
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,946
I always thought my father died
of heart disease.

603
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,784
And I just found out that's not true.

604
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,828
He committed suicide.

605
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,873
Oh, God.

606
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,669
I don't know why he would do that to himself.

607
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,549
Or me.

608
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,431
Oh, baby.

609
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,773
Whatever Harry did and why,

610
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,942
I can't let it distract me from my mission,

611
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,861
not when freedom is so close.

612
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,035
"Found out where your cabin is.
On my way.

613
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,454
"I want my fucking snow."

614
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,165
Shit.

615
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,382
No one appreciates uninvited house guests.

616
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:02,347
Unless I can make the problem
part of my solution.

617
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,864
Are you Chad?

618
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,367
It depends on what you're looking for.

619
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,327
Tim said to come to you.

620
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,414
The Rohypnol.

621
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,291
Roofies?

622
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,709
You?

623
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,547
You're just not my normal kind of customer.

624
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,549
Oh, do stop talking.

625
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,682
Good luck with that.

626
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,488
Thanks for coming.

627
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,369
I thought we should talk.

628
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,288
No. I should talk.

629
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,875
I mean, I yell a lot...

630
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,379
and bitch and complain and...

631
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:20,717
I keep expecting people to just guess
what I want, but I never really say it.

632
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,345
I'd like to hear it.

633
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:33,020
You asked me what I thought would happen
when the case ended.

634
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,607
And the truth is...

635
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,693
I had no fucking idea.

636
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,612
And that was...

637
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,574
exciting, you know?

638
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,118
The not knowing...

639
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,412
what might happen, what could be.

640
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:53,416
It was all possibility.

641
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:59,046
And when you just assumed that we ended
when the case ended...

642
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,342
you crushed that.

643
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,474
And I want it back.

644
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:16,022
Want to know what I thought would happen
when the case ended?

645
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,106
What?

646
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:22,653
I thought the novelty of my AARP discount
would wear off and you'd get tired of me.

647
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,573
Oh, my God.

648
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,328
That's the sweetest thing you've ever said.

649
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,550
Lundy.

650
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:52,350
- On our way.
- What do we got?

651
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,228
A hit on one of Doakes's false IDs
at a car rental agency.

652
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:58,481
- Make, model and licence plate.
- Let's go.

653
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,703
My hero.

654
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,833
This place looks like brand new.

655
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:22,046
It's my pleasure, though I feel a little loopy from
the fumes.

656
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:28,177
So how was your day at the beach?

657
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,389
Auri wore me out.

658
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,266
You ever try and run in the sand?

659
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:36,811
I never run. You're a better man than me.

660
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,146
I'm glad you think so.

661
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,233
And how are Dexter and Rita?

662
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,903
Things are good for them.

663
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,239
I mean...

664
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,367
I think they're gonna work things out.

665
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,885
We going somewhere?

666
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:15,600
Well, you know, I've been trying to hold off.

667
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:19,937
But...

668
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,940
I don't know. I don't want to any more.

669
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,234
I think it's time.

670
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,529
I need you.

671
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,449
You can have me.

672
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:35,119
The thing is...I like it rough.

673
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,579
Yeah?

674
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,127
OK.

675
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,760
- Who the fuck is that?
- Some guy I picked up in a bar.

676
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:55,765
He's a known murderer
and your final victim.

677
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:01,354
- You're not gonna do what I think you are?
- There's no point in hiding it now, Sergeant.

678
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:07,109
Your life is going to rest in the hands of the
criminal justice system you put your faith in.

679
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,696
I wish you the best of luck.

680
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:13,866
Come on, Morgan. We were
just getting somewhere, you and me.

681
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,911
You ain't got to do this.
Come on. We'll find a way.

682
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,040
I'm afraid this is the only way for me.

683
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,545
Excuse me. I need to get my supplies.

684
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,506
Morgan!

685
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:42,436
You are a very bad girl.

686
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:50,194
I'm only just getting started, baby.

687
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,655
Be right back.

688
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,326
Wow.

689
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,789
Lila, you want a beer?

690
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,260
Jesus.

691
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,897
This is Detective Angel Batista
from Miami Metro Homicide.

692
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:10,524
I need an ambulance.

693
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,990
There is no way people
are gonna believe I did this shit.

694
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:21,911
You were US Special Forces.
I'm sure you have done this.

695
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:25,873
Wartime circumstances, heat of the battle, but
never cold-blooded, Morgan.

696
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,793
I'm sure that made things easier for you.

697
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:34,298
Morgan, goddamn it, you got a conscience,
man. You said it yourself.

698
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:37,134
You go after killers,
you take out killers. I get that.

699
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,637
But this? This is some sick-fuck ritual, man.

700
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,180
You need help. Let me help you, man.

701
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:44,225
Don't worry, I won't make you watch.
I'm not uncivilized.

702
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,643
No. Morgan. Morgan, no!

703
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,394
Morgan!

704
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,981
You don't have to do this!
You don't have to kill this man!

705
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:54,485
This man is a felon with a body count.

706
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:58,155
- He brought it on himself.
- Morgan, turn him over to the law.

707
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,907
I live by my father's law.

708
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,118
No! Morgan!

709
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,786
Morgan, don't do this!

710
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,796
Oh, shit.

711
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:39,280
Sorry it had to go down like this, Sergeant, but
there really was no other way.

712
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,785
Sergeant?

713
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,249
Stay away.

714
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,378
Just stay away from me.

715
00:52:55,714 --> 00:53:00,718
I've heard those words before,
three days before my father's death.

716
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,849
Oh. Hey, Dad.

717
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,437
Look what I did.

718
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,734
It's Juan Ryness,
the pimp who killed that girl.

719
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,361
I finally got him for you.

720
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,720
Dad, what's wrong? Are you OK?

721
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:47,598
Just stay away.

722
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:48,724
Please.

723
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,893
Stay away.

724
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,856
It was me.

725
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,318
The idea of a code was one thing,

726
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:03,113
a grand idea, a noble cause.

727
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,658
But the reality of it?

728
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:08,202
Harry walked in on what he created...

729
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:12,081
and he couldn't live with himself.

730
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,591
What, Morgan?

731
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,886
What now?

732
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:32,098
I killed my father.
