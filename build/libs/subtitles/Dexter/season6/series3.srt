2
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:49,250
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:50,785
Holy Franken-fuck!

4
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,920
Snakes!

5
00:01:51,954 --> 00:01:53,688
This is no amateur.

6
00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:55,758
What the fuck?

7
00:01:55,792 --> 00:01:57,928
Debra Morgan,
will you--

8
00:01:57,962 --> 00:01:59,362
Are you insane?

9
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:02,434
What is that holy
piece of shit doing here?

10
00:02:02,468 --> 00:02:04,369
Brother Sam?

11
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:06,473
One big, bad ex-con
turned minister.

12
00:02:06,507 --> 00:02:08,741
Runs an auto body shop using
former inmates.

13
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:10,811
That can't be a man
of the cloth.

14
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,319
That's a killer.

15
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,882
It's why I'm making you
Homicide's new lieutenant.

16
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,652
Fuck balls.
You're serious.

17
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:18,153
I couldn't be happier.

18
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:20,087
It's about time a real cop
had that job.

19
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:23,473
How come if Matthews hates you,

20
00:02:23,508 --> 00:02:25,309
I'm always the one
paying the price?

21
00:02:25,343 --> 00:02:27,778
I can't tell if I'm seeing
a man who's changed

22
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:30,748
for the better
or just a better cover.

23
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:33,050
So that darkness inside
is gone?

24
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:36,754
Still there, but I'm
fighting its ass every day.

25
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,409
Please get off the property.

26
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:40,342
Not without our boy Nick.

27
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:42,226
You deaf, pendejo?

28
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:47,165
I can't marry you.

29
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,600
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:49,968
Ladies and gentlemen,

31
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,571
I give you lieutenant
Debra Morgan.

32
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,111
Hey, you all right?

33
00:02:58,145 --> 00:02:59,579
No.

34
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:00,647
Really?

35
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,884
Yeah, I think I heard
something snap.

36
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:17,366
How about we wind up
the Kentucky derby

37
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,468
and we focus on breakfast?

38
00:03:19,502 --> 00:03:21,703
- Yummy, okay?
- No.

39
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:23,005
- No, Harrison.
- Mine.

40
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,106
Horsey mine.

41
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,207
When you're Harrison's age,

42
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:26,374
everything's important.

43
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:27,642
Everything has meaning,

44
00:03:27,677 --> 00:03:29,645
even a piece of molded plastic.

45
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:34,583
Well, how about we can play
with the horse afterwards, okay?

46
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:39,956
Took me 20 minutes
to decide what to wear.

47
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:42,374
Really?

48
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:43,591
What?
Do I look okay?

49
00:03:43,821 --> 00:03:45,088
Oh, yeah.

50
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:48,558
You put on a jacket...
Over your regular clothes.

51
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:50,160
Yeah, well,
I don't want to overdo it.

52
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:51,626
I still want to look like me,

53
00:03:51,746 --> 00:03:53,497
just lieutenant me.

54
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:55,966
Smart.

55
00:03:57,769 --> 00:03:59,470
It's dispatch.

56
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:02,006
Probable homicide, 930 Euclid.

57
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,475
It's about ten minutes away.
I'll meet you there.

58
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:06,224
You're going
to the crime scene?

59
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:08,312
It's just Laguerta never went
into the field

60
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:10,514
unless she knew the case was
gonna be high-profile.

61
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:12,349
Yeah, well, I'm not Laguerta,
am I?

62
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:16,087
Hey, it's totally your call.

63
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,989
Shit.
You're probably right.

64
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:20,324
It's my first day.

65
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:21,425
I should probably be
at the station

66
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,194
working the snakes killing...

67
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:28,031
in my fucking office.

68
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,799
Okay, buddy.
Be good to Jamie today.

69
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,101
And no fruit roll-ups.

70
00:04:31,135 --> 00:04:32,502
They make you fart.

71
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:34,737
Don't we know.

72
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:36,906
Good luck today.
You're gonna be great.

73
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:39,575
Thanks.

74
00:04:52,855 --> 00:04:54,121
Why are you doing this to me?

75
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:56,958
Please just let me go.

76
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:58,259
You're not going anywhere

77
00:04:58,294 --> 00:05:01,230
until you've repented
for your sins.

78
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:04,166
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for everything.

79
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,402
Not to me.

80
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:11,040
To God.

81
00:05:13,476 --> 00:05:16,979
Beg forgiveness, Nathan.

82
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:20,216
If you're sincere,
all of this will end.

83
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,354
If not, it will get much worse.

84
00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:25,890
But I am sincere.
Please don't--wait.

85
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,644
0 to 60 in 7.2.

86
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,346
A full 800 RPMs
over the red line.

87
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:52,917
In high school,
that was my dream car.

88
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,953
Didn't Smokey drive
one of those?

89
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,120
Or was it the bandit?

90
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:57,188
Burt Reynolds.

91
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:58,822
Yo, guys!

92
00:05:58,857 --> 00:06:01,825
Body's down here.

93
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:08,664
Any idea who she is?

94
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,701
Uh, from her tight mini
and a 24-pack of Trojans

95
00:06:12,736 --> 00:06:15,638
in her pocket, I'd say she's
a working girl.

96
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:16,739
No driver's license?

97
00:06:16,773 --> 00:06:18,040
Haven't found
a purse or an I.D.

98
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:21,710
We need to roll her over.

99
00:06:21,744 --> 00:06:24,279
Easy.

100
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:26,849
Guess she lost her
gym membership.

101
00:06:26,884 --> 00:06:28,798
- Where the hell's Quinn?
- He's on his way.

102
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:33,523
Well, multiple
blunt force trauma,

103
00:06:33,557 --> 00:06:34,757
or manual strangulation.

104
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:37,394
Take your pick.

105
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:51,942
Are you crazy?

106
00:06:51,977 --> 00:06:54,007
Okay, okay.
I'm late. I'm sorry.

107
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:56,280
Not that.
The girl.

108
00:06:56,314 --> 00:06:57,981
What are you doing, man?
What about Deb?

109
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:01,317
Deb and I broke up.

110
00:07:01,352 --> 00:07:02,552
You broke up?

111
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:04,387
Yeah, three days ago.
We're over.

112
00:07:04,421 --> 00:07:06,822
I'm sorry I didn't know that.
What happened?

113
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:08,424
Lieutenant Morgan happened.

114
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,259
She ditched you
because she got promoted?

115
00:07:10,293 --> 00:07:12,928
- That doesn't sound like Deb.
- Yeah?

116
00:07:12,963 --> 00:07:15,064
'Cause this is the same Deb
that stole your job.

117
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:16,433
She didn't steal my job.

118
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:18,135
It was never mine
to start with.

119
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:19,269
That's always been
your problem.

120
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:20,538
You're too nice.

121
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:22,240
You let these fucking people
walk all over you.

122
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:24,476
That's bullshit.

123
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,045
Keep telling yourself that,
Mrs. Laguerta.

124
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,487
You're lucky we got work to do.

125
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:43,129
What's so interesting?

126
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,797
Tooth is chipped.

127
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,965
Well, no surprise there.

128
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:46,999
She really got worked over.

129
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,200
It's probably from the beating.

130
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:52,605
Or someone tried to rip it out.

131
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:01,581
You'll be leading your first
briefing soon,

132
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,449
so make sure you scan all
the field reports.

133
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:04,784
It's next on my list.

134
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,519
I just want to finish going
through these resumes.

135
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:07,554
Resumes?

136
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:08,655
I need to pick a new detective

137
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:09,889
to take my place.

138
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,857
I can't afford to be down
a man right now.

139
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,158
Well, I can help you with that.

140
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,234
Sam Harmon from Narcotics.

141
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,503
He's a real up-and-comer,
and the fact

142
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:26,072
that this father's a district
judge could come in handy.

143
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,107
Yeah, I know Sam.
He's a solid cop.

144
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:30,310
Great.
Happy to help.

145
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,978
There are a lot of other names
on this list.

146
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:33,280
You know, there's this guy
from Chicago--

147
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:34,548
Forget him.

148
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,016
With everything
on your plate right now,

149
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:37,317
the last thing you want
to worry about

150
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:39,520
is a transfer situation,
trust me.

151
00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:41,689
Harmon's your guy.

152
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:43,091
Do you want me to start
the paperwork?

153
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,293
No.

154
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:46,962
I've--I've got it.

155
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:51,234
Go ahead.

156
00:08:51,268 --> 00:08:52,768
Morgan.

157
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:55,104
Don't let her shove something
down your throat,

158
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:58,007
not unless you're ready
for seconds or thirds.

159
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,910
Take it from Mrs. Laguerta.

160
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:03,079
Got it.
Thanks.

161
00:09:03,113 --> 00:09:05,749
Deb, one of the most important
things about this job

162
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:08,017
is knowing how to marshal
your resources.

163
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:10,553
Take the help
when it's offered.

164
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:13,256
Remember,
we're in this together.

165
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,273
I remember when
I found that under your bed.

166
00:10:04,308 --> 00:10:09,413
I would have rather it had been
a stack of <i>Playboys.</i>

167
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:10,914
Most kids in the eighth grade
were obsessed

168
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:12,816
with their favorite
baseball players.

169
00:10:12,851 --> 00:10:14,919
You tried serial killers.

170
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:18,289
Only certain ones.

171
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:21,125
The Tooth Fairy was smart...

172
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,261
and arrogant.

173
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:25,329
They never caught him,
even when he left a body

174
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:27,631
on a deputy sheriff's lawn.

175
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:33,304
15 women--prostitutes--
all dumped on the roadside,

176
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:35,939
all missing
their lateral incisors.

177
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:36,974
You really think there's
a connection

178
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:38,776
to the victim
from this morning?

179
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,677
Her lateral incisor was cracked

180
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:43,146
like someone tried
to rip it out with pliers.

181
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,216
There was damage to her gums.

182
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,251
Probably a result
of the beating,

183
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:50,653
like Masuka said.

184
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:54,191
Maybe someone was trying
to relive old times?

185
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:57,495
The Tooth Fairy killings
were in the '80s, Dexter.

186
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:59,697
He'd be 70 years old at least.

187
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:03,168
What would he be doing
in Miami?

188
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:06,272
Why do most 70 year olds
come to Miami?

189
00:11:16,883 --> 00:11:20,385
They say old age is like
a second childhood.

190
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:25,057
There are primary colors...

191
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:30,162
tricycles...

192
00:11:30,197 --> 00:11:33,933
and ball chasing.

193
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:36,502
I barely made it through
my first childhood.

194
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:44,176
I guess no one makes it
through the second.

195
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,678
This place is one block from
where the victim was found.

196
00:11:46,713 --> 00:11:50,148
A short walk for a retiree
on a mission.

197
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:56,288
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

198
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:59,058
I'm, uh, thinking about moving
my dad down here.

199
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,228
He's 81, but still sprightly.

200
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,630
Bless his heart.

201
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:05,565
Coral Island's
a great facility.

202
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,634
I'm happy to answer any
questions you have.

203
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:10,470
Do you have any other
residents here from Oregon?

204
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:13,540
My dad's kind of shy and it'd be
nice to have people around

205
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:16,509
with something in common,
besides hearing loss.

206
00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:19,779
Well, let's see.

207
00:12:22,383 --> 00:12:24,218
We have three residents
form Oregon.

208
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:25,886
Fine people.

209
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:27,888
I'm sure your dad will get along
with them famously.

210
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:29,289
That's good to hear.

211
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:30,691
Here are some brochures
with everything

212
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:32,892
you need to know about
Coral Island.

213
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:35,294
There's some forms to fill out
in case you're interested

214
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:36,762
in having your dad join us.

215
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,765
Thanks.

216
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,700
Hey, I hate to trouble you,

217
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:43,202
but that coffee
really looks good.

218
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:44,436
I was gonna get some earlier.

219
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,704
I feel a caffeine headache
coming on.

220
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:48,272
I know what that's like.

221
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:49,306
I'll fetch you a mug.

222
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:50,474
Be right back.

223
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:52,543
I appreciate it.

224
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:05,288
One woman...
Another in a wheelchair.

225
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:07,390
That leaves...

226
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:08,658
Walter Kenney.

227
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:11,628
Moved here from Grants Pass,
Oregon, five years ago.

228
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:15,599
How are you spending
your second childhood?

229
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:21,272
What's that?

230
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:22,840
Oh, you've been doing
such a good job,

231
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,843
I put together a little surprise
for your viewing pleasure.

232
00:13:25,878 --> 00:13:27,579
Is this what I think it is?

233
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:29,815
Evidence from the Ice Truck
Killer investigation.

234
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:32,451
You said in class how
you were really into this case.

235
00:13:32,485 --> 00:13:33,952
Are you kidding?

236
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:35,854
I was obsessed with this case.

237
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:38,223
I have followed it
night and day.

238
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:39,457
This is really sweet.

239
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,999
This is the Ice Truck Killer's
hospital I.D.

240
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:54,371
And the holy of holies.

241
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:57,373
Oh, wow.

242
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:03,846
Whoa.

243
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,715
You know...

244
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:08,750
When the details of this case
were made public,

245
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:11,886
I painted my nails like this
for a whole week.

246
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,154
Is that just wrong?

247
00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:15,889
Is it wrong
that it makes me hot?

248
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:21,295
Uh...what do they do
with all this stuff?

249
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:24,565
It just sits here
in evidence...forever.

250
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,534
That's a shame.

251
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:28,436
I mean, this is a piece
of history.

252
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:35,010
It's time for the briefing.

253
00:14:36,713 --> 00:14:38,914
Oh, there you are.

254
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:41,684
I've sat through God knows
how many briefings.

255
00:14:41,718 --> 00:14:43,219
Why am I so fucking nervous?

256
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:44,554
Because everyone will be
looking to see

257
00:14:44,588 --> 00:14:46,122
if you know what you're doing.

258
00:14:46,156 --> 00:14:47,424
Do me a favor.

259
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,525
When you get back to your desk,

260
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,193
look up the word "rhetorical."

261
00:14:50,228 --> 00:14:52,529
You'll be fine, Deb.

262
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:53,897
Okay, everyone,
we've got a lot to cover,

263
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:55,965
so let's get started.

264
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,110
First up is the homicide
on Euclid.

265
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,102
Where are we on identifying
the victim?

266
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:01,903
Her fingerprints
gave us a name.

267
00:15:01,938 --> 00:15:03,705
Rosalia Davolos.

268
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:06,074
Several priors
for solicitation.

269
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:07,708
We talked to a local merchant.

270
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:09,610
It seems that strip
was practically her office.

271
00:15:09,644 --> 00:15:10,644
Did we run her cell phone?

272
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:12,145
That turned up
a long list of numbers.

273
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,714
Mostly johns.

274
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,049
Uh, we're working through
the names now.

275
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,584
What about a tox screen?

276
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:20,154
Trace amounts of cocaine
in her system and...

277
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:21,822
doughnuts.

278
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:25,326
Let's, uh, check the area
for known pushers.

279
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,194
Maybe she got caught up
in a bad deal

280
00:15:27,229 --> 00:15:28,829
or she got behind on a payment.

281
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:31,098
I'm hoping five
or six people will volunteer--

282
00:15:31,132 --> 00:15:32,933
They'll never tie this
to a quarter-century-old

283
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:35,669
serial killer case from Oregon.

284
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:38,905
Not sure I have either,
but I can dream.

285
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,341
That takes us
to the snakes killing.

286
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,177
It's looking like this wasn't
a drug cartel hit after all.

287
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,445
As much as I hate to admit it,

288
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,247
maybe Brother Sam was right
about our victim.

289
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,883
Maybe he cleaned up his act.

290
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,451
That doesn't mean there wasn't
someone out there

291
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:53,487
looking to settle an old score.

292
00:15:53,522 --> 00:15:55,623
What if we made some of
the details of the case public,

293
00:15:55,657 --> 00:15:56,924
like the snakes?

294
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:02,864
Might scare up a lead.

295
00:16:02,898 --> 00:16:04,024
Uh, no.

296
00:16:04,144 --> 00:16:06,527
That may compromise the case
when it goes to court.

297
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:10,039
If we don't catch anyone,
this will never go to court.

298
00:16:10,074 --> 00:16:13,442
I think detective Quinn
has a point.

299
00:16:13,477 --> 00:16:16,646
We let word out about
the snakes.

300
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,514
The press will eat it up.
Who knows?

301
00:16:18,548 --> 00:16:20,616
Maybe something
will shake loose.

302
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:23,219
What about the trial?

303
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:24,653
Well, Quinn's right.

304
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:25,721
There'll never be a trial

305
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:27,356
unless we get someone
into custody.

306
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,691
I think it's worth a try.

307
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:31,394
Angel, get started
on the statement.

308
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:33,797
Have it on my desk
by this afternoon.

309
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:44,309
I don't think you
really believe

310
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:45,844
what you are saying, Nathan!

311
00:16:45,878 --> 00:16:48,046
You need to believe
what you are saying!

312
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:49,347
I do.
I swear.

313
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:52,751
I just--I don't know what it is
you want from me.

314
00:16:52,785 --> 00:16:56,921
I want to hear you tell God
that you are sorry.

315
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:58,256
Okay.
Okay.

316
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,092
Please, please, God...

317
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:05,129
I'm sorry for--for--
for everything I've ever done.

318
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:07,365
Just forgive me.

319
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:09,700
Forgive me.

320
00:17:09,735 --> 00:17:12,937
For...give me.

321
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,546
No, no.
Wait. Wait.

322
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:24,515
Where are you going?
Let me go!

323
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,850
Let me go!

324
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:40,097
He's telling you what you
want to hear.

325
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:44,534
He thinks we're gonna
release him.

326
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:56,313
How much longer do we
have to make him suffer?

327
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:59,784
You really have a good heart,
Travis.

328
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:04,223
That's why I picked you.

329
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:07,193
But there's much more
at stake here

330
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:10,764
than one man's suffering.

331
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,801
Don't we have to be strong?

332
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:19,005
He has to be pure
or we can't proceed.

333
00:18:21,107 --> 00:18:22,074
Yes.

334
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:25,109
Hey, he's coming around.

335
00:18:25,144 --> 00:18:28,379
It just takes time.

336
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,024
Good morning, Walter.

337
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:44,094
Keep saying that and one day
you might be right.

338
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:46,196
Sam's group is about
to tee off.

339
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:49,566
You can join them.

340
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:51,235
Hey, I'm short a partner.

341
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:52,669
Dan.

342
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:55,339
Walter Kenney.

343
00:18:55,373 --> 00:18:57,208
I'm a little rusty,

344
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:58,776
but I'll try
not to slow you down.

345
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,012
Just get a cart, will you?

346
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,320
Worst mistake I ever made
was moving down

347
00:19:08,354 --> 00:19:12,624
to this piss-butt
corner country.

348
00:19:12,658 --> 00:19:15,027
How bad can it be?
It's the Sunshine State.

349
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:19,198
Only sunshine around here is
what they blow up your ass.

350
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:22,668
The rest is mosquitoes,
humidity,

351
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:23,869
and people that don't
speak English.

352
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,640
So what's a young guy like you

353
00:19:28,674 --> 00:19:30,608
doing around Coral Island,

354
00:19:30,643 --> 00:19:34,179
or do you get off hanging out
with corpses?

355
00:19:35,736 --> 00:19:37,505
I'm checking it out for my dad.

356
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:39,195
You want to help your dad?

357
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:40,963
Take him to the end of the pier
and push him off.

358
00:19:40,998 --> 00:19:43,466
You'll be doing him a favor.

359
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,435
If I was any more in the rough,

360
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:47,303
I'd need a fucking machete.

361
00:19:47,338 --> 00:19:51,607
This is like being trapped
in a toxic cloud...

362
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:54,143
that cheats.

363
00:19:58,315 --> 00:20:00,649
Oh!
Son of a bitch!

364
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:02,050
You okay?

365
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:03,951
Oh, I always scream in pain
when I take a swing.

366
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:06,053
Don't just stand there.

367
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:07,387
I need to sit down.

368
00:20:07,422 --> 00:20:09,122
All right.

369
00:20:09,156 --> 00:20:11,958
Oh, I ruptured my back
two years ago.

370
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:13,393
It hasn't been the same since.

371
00:20:13,427 --> 00:20:15,328
Okay, just take it easy.

372
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:16,630
Jesus fucking Christ!

373
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:18,833
Listen, I'm done here.

374
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:22,002
Just drop me off
at the club bar.

375
00:20:22,036 --> 00:20:23,304
I need something
to kill the pain.

376
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:26,273
You got it.

377
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:36,150
So what'd you used to do
up in Oregon?

378
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:39,487
I was a pipefitter
for 25 years.

379
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:43,090
Shit job, but I managed
to work up a pension.

380
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,460
All I want to do now
is play golf.

381
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,062
Mmm.

382
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:49,498
Maybe you should find something
else to pass the time.

383
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:53,636
I tell you, it's hell not
being able to do what you love.

384
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,838
Is he talking about golf
or his failure

385
00:20:55,872 --> 00:21:00,209
to rip out Rosalia Davolos'
tooth?

386
00:21:00,244 --> 00:21:02,545
Walter Kenney may be
the world's oldest asshole,

387
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,648
but that doesn't make him
a killer.

388
00:21:04,682 --> 00:21:07,651
On the other hand,
maybe I gave up too soon.

389
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:14,490
He wears a dental implant
for the lateral incisor.

390
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,525
The same one the Tooth Fairy
pulled from his victims.

391
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,798
Excuse me.

392
00:21:22,832 --> 00:21:24,065
Hello?

393
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,300
This is Sam from
Good Shepherd Auto.

394
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:28,235
I was just calling to
let you know your car's ready.

395
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,737
Great.
When can I pick it up?

396
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:31,472
Well, if you get here
before 6:00,

397
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:34,109
you won't have to fight
the dog off this time.

398
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,912
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.

399
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:49,627
This is on me.

400
00:21:49,661 --> 00:21:51,596
I got to go pick up my car.

401
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,197
Well, you know,
I've got a shit-load of errands

402
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:55,166
to run tomorrow and
with my back the way it is,

403
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,601
I'm gonna have
a real hard time on the bus.

404
00:21:57,635 --> 00:21:59,402
You wouldn't want to give me
a ride, would you?

405
00:21:59,437 --> 00:22:00,937
Perfect, now I won't have
to make an excuse

406
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:02,271
to run into you again.

407
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:04,039
I'm in 72.

408
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:05,474
Pick me up at 9:00.

409
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:07,275
Actually, I'd rather
have my teeth pulled.

410
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,376
Happy to do it.

411
00:22:30,335 --> 00:22:34,071
People don't put no oil in it
and then wonder why they--

412
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:35,439
Hey.

413
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:36,973
Hey, man, yeah.
She's right down here.

414
00:22:37,008 --> 00:22:38,275
I'll be right back, Nick.

415
00:22:40,077 --> 00:22:41,144
Hey, God bless him.

416
00:22:41,178 --> 00:22:43,313
Nick has been busting his ass,
man.

417
00:22:43,347 --> 00:22:46,182
Off the drugs.
Cut his ties with the gang, man.

418
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:49,285
I--I really think he wants
to change.

419
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,686
You must be relieved.

420
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:52,955
I'm proud of him is what
I am, man.

421
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,857
It's not easy turning your
life around, man.

422
00:22:54,892 --> 00:22:56,326
It could go south
at any minute,

423
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,096
but I'll take the blessings
as they come.

424
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:01,598
This looks like the day
I bought it.

425
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,832
You do good work.

426
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:06,303
Well, it's--it's all these
repair jobs

427
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:09,774
that pay for that good work.

428
00:23:09,808 --> 00:23:11,509
Listen.

429
00:23:11,543 --> 00:23:12,910
You got any plans this Sunday?

430
00:23:12,944 --> 00:23:15,311
Like service?

431
00:23:15,346 --> 00:23:16,813
What would I
be getting serviced?

432
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:19,815
Uh, like a church service.

433
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,585
No.
Not much of a churchgoer.

434
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:24,654
Yeah, I figured that.

435
00:23:24,688 --> 00:23:27,357
Well, we having something
like a company get together,

436
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:28,591
like a beach party.

437
00:23:28,626 --> 00:23:30,226
It'd be great
if you could come.

438
00:23:30,261 --> 00:23:31,394
Well, this Sunday's tough.

439
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:33,129
I don't have a sitter
for Harrison.

440
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:34,297
Oh, that's your boy?

441
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:36,966
Yep.
He's two.

442
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,968
Yeah?
Bring him along.

443
00:23:39,003 --> 00:23:40,970
It's a kid-friendly environment.

444
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,205
He'll love it.

445
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:45,509
Play some ball,
put the grill on,

446
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:48,845
have a little beach
barbecue baptism.

447
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,782
- Baptism?
- Yeah. Nick.

448
00:23:51,816 --> 00:23:53,684
He's taking the big leap,
praise God.

449
00:23:53,718 --> 00:23:55,853
He's taking the holy spirit
on right there

450
00:23:55,887 --> 00:23:57,288
in the waters
of the Biscayne Bay.

451
00:23:57,322 --> 00:23:59,390
Sounds like you're trying
to get me to go to church.

452
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:01,059
So what?

453
00:24:01,093 --> 00:24:04,329
What, you afraid you
gonna catch something?

454
00:24:04,364 --> 00:24:07,299
I'm just not sure I fit in.

455
00:24:07,334 --> 00:24:08,768
Sure you do.

456
00:24:08,802 --> 00:24:10,803
Listen.

457
00:24:10,838 --> 00:24:13,072
I just think it'd be great
for you

458
00:24:13,107 --> 00:24:15,708
to take a stand with someone
whose life

459
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:17,944
that you helped turn around.

460
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:21,081
And if you do happen
to find God,

461
00:24:21,115 --> 00:24:22,883
a lot worse ways you could
spend your day off.

462
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,498
Only one mention
of Walter Kenney

463
00:24:37,532 --> 00:24:40,935
in the criminal database
and he's identified as a victim.

464
00:24:40,969 --> 00:24:42,370
Walter Kenney's mother,

465
00:24:42,404 --> 00:24:45,006
charged with felony child abuse
against her son.

466
00:24:48,243 --> 00:24:50,277
I have to vent or my head's
gonna explode.

467
00:24:50,311 --> 00:24:52,880
- What's wrong?
- Everything.

468
00:24:52,914 --> 00:24:54,281
I'm my ex-boyfriend's boss.

469
00:24:54,315 --> 00:24:56,149
I don't know how to act.

470
00:24:56,184 --> 00:24:58,653
I don't know what to do.
I don't know who to hire.

471
00:24:58,687 --> 00:25:00,988
I have a stack of paperwork
on my desk

472
00:25:01,022 --> 00:25:02,122
that's taller than I am.

473
00:25:02,157 --> 00:25:03,658
Well, take a breath, sit down.

474
00:25:03,692 --> 00:25:07,128
I think I really fucked up
taking this promotion.

475
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:09,798
I was a fucking great detective

476
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:13,402
who loved her fucking job.

477
00:25:13,437 --> 00:25:15,905
I traded it all in for politics

478
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:18,208
and paperwork and Laguerta
up my ass.

479
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:19,409
Deb, you're too smart to think

480
00:25:19,444 --> 00:25:20,844
that this was gonna be easy.

481
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:22,012
Well, I didn't expect this.

482
00:25:22,047 --> 00:25:23,514
I didn't expect people
sitting around

483
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:24,816
waiting for me to fall
on my face.

484
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,918
No one wants you to fail.

485
00:25:26,952 --> 00:25:29,054
Okay, Laguerta probably
wouldn't lose any sleep

486
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,155
if you stumbled a bit.

487
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:31,589
She'd pop a bottle
of champagne.

488
00:25:31,624 --> 00:25:32,991
But guess what.
You're new at the job.

489
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:35,160
You're gonna stumble.

490
00:25:35,194 --> 00:25:36,428
You think Laguerta
never messed up?

491
00:25:36,462 --> 00:25:37,729
Shit yeah.

492
00:25:37,763 --> 00:25:40,265
Cut yourself some slack.

493
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:41,699
You've been lieutenant one day.

494
00:25:41,733 --> 00:25:43,601
If a couple months go by,
you still hate it,

495
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:45,670
you can demote yourself,
but until then,

496
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:47,138
just go with your gut.

497
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:48,205
And when you screw up,

498
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,251
just don't take me down with you.
I need the paycheck.

499
00:25:51,443 --> 00:25:53,311
Okay.

500
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:55,213
My panic needle's swinging out
of the red.

501
00:25:55,247 --> 00:25:57,248
Good.

502
00:25:57,283 --> 00:26:00,885
How are you
with the Quinn of it?

503
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,554
I miss being with him.

504
00:26:02,588 --> 00:26:04,923
Really?

505
00:26:04,957 --> 00:26:06,524
Quinn's a good guy.
We had fun together.

506
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,927
It was easy.
No expectations.

507
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:11,230
That's one decision
I know I made right.

508
00:26:11,264 --> 00:26:14,466
Quinn and I were never meant
to get serious.

509
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:15,834
I have to go.

510
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:17,870
I have to put people
on the snakes killing.

511
00:26:17,904 --> 00:26:19,838
Thank you for talking me
off the ledge.

512
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:21,239
You're the best.

513
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:23,275
Is it a good time for me
to ask for a raise?

514
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,178
- Terrible.
- I'm serious.

515
00:26:26,212 --> 00:26:28,847
Fuck off and die.

516
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:34,520
Maybe she shouldn't have
taken the promotion.

517
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:36,255
She might not be cut out
for it.

518
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:38,924
I think there's very little
Deb's not cut out for.

519
00:26:41,494 --> 00:26:43,562
Kenney's mother
was taken into custody

520
00:26:43,597 --> 00:26:49,235
for repeatedly hitting her son
in the face in public.

521
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:50,569
I'm not seeing the connection.

522
00:26:50,604 --> 00:26:52,138
Maybe that's how he
lost his tooth.

523
00:26:52,172 --> 00:26:54,807
So Walter Kenney
has mother issues.

524
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:56,208
Sounds familiar.

525
00:26:56,243 --> 00:26:58,410
Doesn't mean that he is
the Tooth Fairy.

526
00:26:58,445 --> 00:26:59,846
Ah, but it's another reason
for me

527
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,516
to spend my day off
with Mister Sunshine.

528
00:27:24,438 --> 00:27:27,240
You said 9:00.

529
00:27:27,274 --> 00:27:28,808
I just need
a couple of seconds.

530
00:27:40,387 --> 00:27:43,622
TV, barcalounger,
and a view of the parking lot.

531
00:27:43,657 --> 00:27:48,494
This wasn't on
the Coral Island brochure.

532
00:28:11,715 --> 00:28:15,318
My son.

533
00:28:15,352 --> 00:28:17,687
Gave him everything in life

534
00:28:17,721 --> 00:28:20,690
and now I can't get him
on the phone.

535
00:28:20,724 --> 00:28:23,959
You have kids?

536
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,127
You're lucky.

537
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,996
Ungrateful little pricks.

538
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,232
They suck the life out of you
and then they vanish.

539
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:35,403
Where are my fucking
house keys?

540
00:28:35,438 --> 00:28:37,271
He's completely alone.

541
00:28:37,306 --> 00:28:42,410
Alienated everyone around him.

542
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:43,411
Ah!

543
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:45,279
Here they are.

544
00:28:45,314 --> 00:28:47,315
I'm losing my fucking mind.

545
00:28:53,288 --> 00:28:58,458
Abrams in 23.

546
00:28:58,492 --> 00:29:02,962
Dumb as a bag of dog shit.

547
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:07,265
Looks like a space just opened
up for your dad.

548
00:29:16,508 --> 00:29:19,144
Aw, shit.

549
00:29:19,178 --> 00:29:21,246
Uh...

550
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,947
Here's my prescription.

551
00:29:22,982 --> 00:29:24,983
Just pick it up for me,
will you?

552
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,821
Sure.

553
00:29:32,658 --> 00:29:36,428
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

554
00:29:36,462 --> 00:29:38,530
And a six-pack of beer
from the liquor store

555
00:29:38,564 --> 00:29:43,768
and the latest <i>Teen Ass,</i>
<i>Nipple Parade,</i> and <i>Spanked.</i>

556
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:45,971
<i>Teen Ass, Nipple Parade,</i>
and <i>Spanked.</i>

557
00:29:46,005 --> 00:29:51,844
Can this really be the man who
inspired me to keep a scrapbook?

558
00:29:58,819 --> 00:30:00,286
Can I get...

559
00:30:00,321 --> 00:30:03,623
<i>Teen Ass, Nipple Parade,</i>
and <i>Spanked?</i>

560
00:30:03,657 --> 00:30:05,659
Ah!

561
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:14,134
Some needs just don't
go away...

562
00:30:14,168 --> 00:30:17,204
Even if the equipment
is on life support.

563
00:30:17,238 --> 00:30:19,572
Does that hold true
for killing?

564
00:30:25,446 --> 00:30:28,748
Just one more stop and then
I'm out of your hair.

565
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:36,723
I'll take the bus home
from here.

566
00:30:36,758 --> 00:30:39,760
What about your back?

567
00:30:39,795 --> 00:30:42,230
Got my remedy.

568
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:45,434
See ya.

569
00:31:03,454 --> 00:31:05,121
What wrong turns do you take

570
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:08,591
to lead to this at the end
of your life?

571
00:31:11,862 --> 00:31:14,364
An 8x12 storage shed,
a 6-pack of beer,

572
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,533
and a stack of porno mags.

573
00:31:22,608 --> 00:31:24,943
I need those rundowns
on the interviews you did

574
00:31:24,977 --> 00:31:26,511
with the victim's johns.

575
00:31:26,545 --> 00:31:28,346
Yeah, I'm still working on 'em.

576
00:31:28,381 --> 00:31:29,881
Anything I should know?

577
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:31,383
You know,
they're all sketchy characters,

578
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:33,484
but their alibis check out.

579
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,953
Uh, final forensics report
on the snakes killing.

580
00:31:35,988 --> 00:31:36,954
Nothing new, but if you notice

581
00:31:36,988 --> 00:31:38,789
the grammar's improved,

582
00:31:38,823 --> 00:31:41,425
it's because Ryan typed it up.

583
00:31:41,459 --> 00:31:42,893
So...Ryan, right?

584
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:44,828
You've been here a week now.

585
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,563
How you liking it?

586
00:31:46,597 --> 00:31:48,098
- It's heaven.
- Heaven?

587
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:50,933
- Even with Vince around?
- Ha-ha, good one.

588
00:31:50,968 --> 00:31:53,103
I love Homicide.

589
00:31:53,137 --> 00:31:55,372
I've always been fascinated
by people who do bad things.

590
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:57,341
Maybe that's 'cause you
got a little bad in you.

591
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,610
You think?

592
00:31:59,644 --> 00:32:02,446
Oh, I think you got
a lot of bad in you.

593
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:04,850
You may be right.

594
00:32:04,884 --> 00:32:06,418
Yeah.

595
00:32:06,452 --> 00:32:09,755
But you'll never know.

596
00:32:13,426 --> 00:32:16,628
Can I talk to you for a second?

597
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:23,000
We're, uh, still interviewing

598
00:32:23,035 --> 00:32:24,102
Rosalia's johns.

599
00:32:24,136 --> 00:32:27,472
- So far, nothing.
- Not about the case.

600
00:32:27,506 --> 00:32:30,341
I want to know how you're doing
with the whole situation.

601
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,643
Right.
Uh, I'm good.

602
00:32:32,678 --> 00:32:33,845
Uh, matter of fact,

603
00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:34,979
I just got done
packing up your stuff.

604
00:32:35,013 --> 00:32:37,348
You didn't have to do that.

605
00:32:37,383 --> 00:32:39,717
You know, I figured you're
busy with your new job and all.

606
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,385
You know, might not have time.

607
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,587
Kind of wanted it out
of the house.

608
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:44,723
So, um, if you want
to pick it up,

609
00:32:44,757 --> 00:32:48,794
it's in the garage right next
to the big bag of fertilizer.

610
00:32:51,098 --> 00:32:52,798
Quinn, I know you're pissed.

611
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:55,968
You're doing a great job
of letting me know that.

612
00:32:56,003 --> 00:32:58,405
But this wasn't easy
on me either.

613
00:32:58,439 --> 00:32:59,606
I'm sure.

614
00:32:59,641 --> 00:33:00,641
You know, from what I hear,
that promotion

615
00:33:00,675 --> 00:33:01,875
just came out of the blue.

616
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,578
You think that
my becoming lieutenant

617
00:33:03,612 --> 00:33:05,913
had anything to do with
what happened between us?

618
00:33:05,948 --> 00:33:08,149
No, I'm sure it was just
a big fucking coincidence.

619
00:33:08,184 --> 00:33:11,185
Quinn, that is so
fucking unfair.

620
00:33:11,219 --> 00:33:12,887
There seems to be a lot
of that going around.

621
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:13,988
I got my share.

622
00:33:14,022 --> 00:33:18,025
Maybe you're getting yours.

623
00:34:18,854 --> 00:34:20,221
Ah!

624
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,297
Don't hurt me.

625
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,966
You have to make a choice,
Nathan.

626
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,502
Are you going to be saved?

627
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,837
- It's up to you.
- Yes, please!

628
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:36,340
Please.

629
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,275
Dear God, cleanse me

630
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,078
of all my sins.

631
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,981
Forgive me for all the evil
that I've done.

632
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:47,651
Forgive me for--

633
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,487
Forgive me.

634
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:54,592
Forgive me.

635
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:59,163
Forgive me.
Forgive me.

636
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,666
He's ready.

637
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:08,138
Two hours in that
storage facility.

638
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,340
I'm guessing he wasn't

639
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:12,342
organizing his
<i>Penthouse</i> collection.

640
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:38,363
It's like my box of slides.

641
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,533
Dried blood on the roots.

642
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:47,070
These are from all
of his victims.

643
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,805
He's the Tooth Fairy.

644
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,282
The man who terrorized the
Pacific Northwest for 20 years.

645
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:03,052
All he has left
is a box of teeth.

646
00:37:03,086 --> 00:37:07,055
Is this what happens
to serial killers

647
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:11,461
at the end of their lives?

648
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,067
Everything's ready.

649
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,003
Kenney's apartment will make
the perfect kill room.

650
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,671
No one ever visits him
and the maid

651
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:24,741
won't show up until
the morning.

652
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:27,411
Tonight, Walter Kenney
will have his final tee off.

653
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,620
- Hello?
- It's Walter.

654
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:37,787
I'm really fucked!

655
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,122
What is it?

656
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,990
I got off at the wrong stop
and now

657
00:37:41,024 --> 00:37:42,592
I don't know where
the hell I am.

658
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:44,960
I've been riding around
for hours.

659
00:37:44,995 --> 00:37:46,662
- Fucking hell!
- Okay, okay.

660
00:37:46,696 --> 00:37:49,131
Just calm down.
I'll swing by and pick you up.

661
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:53,169
What's the street name
and number of the bus stop?

662
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,506
321...Alatka.

663
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:57,507
Got it.

664
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:58,609
Just stay where you are.

665
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,644
I'll be there in ten minutes.

666
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,347
He made it easy for me
to vet him.

667
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:04,516
Now he's making it easy
for me to kill him.

668
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,653
Kenney's a monster,
but at least he's considerate.

669
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,899
I don't know what
the fuck's wrong with me.

670
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:26,668
Sometimes I get so confused.

671
00:38:26,702 --> 00:38:27,936
Yeah, don't worry about it.

672
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,971
I'm just glad I was
in the neighborhood.

673
00:38:30,005 --> 00:38:31,806
I don't know what
I would have done

674
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,009
if you hadn't answered.

675
00:38:35,043 --> 00:38:36,944
You're a good kid.

676
00:38:36,978 --> 00:38:38,779
As if I wasn't starting
to feel enough pity for him,

677
00:38:38,813 --> 00:38:40,213
now he's throwing gratitude
at me?

678
00:38:41,249 --> 00:38:43,751
Keep your eye on the road...

679
00:38:43,786 --> 00:38:46,854
or I'll blow your head
out the window.

680
00:38:46,888 --> 00:38:48,890
Drive until I tell you to turn.

681
00:38:48,924 --> 00:38:50,658
How did you get on to me?

682
00:38:50,692 --> 00:38:52,059
I don't know what
you're talking about.

683
00:38:52,093 --> 00:38:54,695
You're Miami Metro, Dexter.

684
00:38:54,729 --> 00:38:56,830
I checked your car registration

685
00:38:56,864 --> 00:38:59,199
when you were filling
my prescription,

686
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:01,168
and then I "goggled" your name.

687
00:39:01,202 --> 00:39:03,870
Yeah, that's right, dickwad.

688
00:39:03,904 --> 00:39:06,372
Maybe I haven't taken a decent
shit in ten years,

689
00:39:06,406 --> 00:39:10,042
but I'm not fucking stupid.

690
00:39:10,077 --> 00:39:13,179
Turn right at the next light.

691
00:39:13,214 --> 00:39:17,417
Okay.

692
00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:21,322
Where are we going?

693
00:39:21,356 --> 00:39:23,023
To settle our business.

694
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:26,661
And you're gonna tell me
how you figured out who I am.

695
00:39:26,695 --> 00:39:28,096
And then you're gonna kill me?

696
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:31,399
You haven't left me much
choice, have you?

697
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:34,001
Left into the next parking lot.

698
00:39:34,035 --> 00:39:37,705
Okay.

699
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:39,140
Just for kicks,

700
00:39:39,174 --> 00:39:43,878
I might rip out all your teeth
before I shoot you.

701
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:45,846
What the fuck are you--

702
00:39:56,592 --> 00:39:59,561
Uh, those are, uh,
ready for cataloging.

703
00:39:59,595 --> 00:40:02,063
Hey, um, after work tonight,
you want to grab some pho?

704
00:40:02,098 --> 00:40:04,266
Grab some what?

705
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,600
Uh, it's Vietnamese food.

706
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:08,237
It's basically a large bowl
of noodles.

707
00:40:08,271 --> 00:40:10,005
And broth.

708
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,008
So you're asking me out?

709
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,309
As in a date?

710
00:40:13,343 --> 00:40:14,376
Well, you don't have
to call it that

711
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:15,378
if you don't want to.

712
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:18,180
I want to.

713
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,382
So that's a yes?

714
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,284
Yeah.

715
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,253
Wow.

716
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,688
What?

717
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,490
It's just that I ran
the conversation

718
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:28,792
through my mind
and bunch of times.

719
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,928
It always ended in rejection
and bodily harm.

720
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:34,497
You should be more confident.

721
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,266
You know, in the right light,
you're actually kind of cute.

722
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:40,938
I'm about to interview
my top pick

723
00:40:40,973 --> 00:40:42,540
for the detective slot.

724
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:43,875
I thought you might
want to sit in.

725
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,244
Oh, no point.

726
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:46,345
Sam Harmon and I go way back.

727
00:40:46,379 --> 00:40:48,180
Harmon's not my top choice.

728
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:49,515
He's not?

729
00:40:49,549 --> 00:40:52,251
It's Mike Anderson,
the transfer from Chicago.

730
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:54,019
He's got ten years on Homicide,

731
00:40:54,054 --> 00:40:55,421
a ridiculous solve rate,

732
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:57,856
recommendations coming
out of his ass.

733
00:40:57,891 --> 00:40:58,990
We'd be lucky to have him.

734
00:40:59,025 --> 00:41:00,792
I really put a lot
of thought into this.

735
00:41:00,826 --> 00:41:02,660
If that's true,
then I'm seriously

736
00:41:02,695 --> 00:41:03,962
worried about your judgment,

737
00:41:03,996 --> 00:41:05,797
because this is a huge mistake.

738
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:08,033
I don't think it is.

739
00:41:08,067 --> 00:41:09,700
Look, I know I'm new
at this job.

740
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:11,602
And it's not that I don't
value your advice,

741
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,505
but sometimes I have
to trust my gut,

742
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:16,841
and right now my gut
is telling me Mike Anderson.

743
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:20,044
It's your decision, lieutenant.

744
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:22,280
You can do whatever
the hell you want.

745
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,282
But understand this.
You're on your own.

746
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,918
If this doesn't work out,

747
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:28,986
don't look to me
to have your back.

748
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:44,470
Mike Anderson.

749
00:41:44,504 --> 00:41:45,738
I'm here to see the lieutenant.

750
00:41:45,772 --> 00:41:47,507
That's me.
It's great to meet you.

751
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:49,075
Debra Morgan.

752
00:41:51,244 --> 00:41:53,712
- What's funny?
- You...The lieutenant.

753
00:41:53,746 --> 00:41:55,247
- That a problem?
- Listen.

754
00:41:55,281 --> 00:41:56,581
I just got off
a three-hour flight

755
00:41:56,616 --> 00:41:57,983
and I'm really tired,

756
00:41:58,017 --> 00:41:59,484
which means I'm not in the mood

757
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:01,085
for any cute department
razzing.

758
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,554
So will you take me to your
boss, please?

759
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:06,389
Maybe score me some coffee
on the way, no cream.

760
00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:10,894
You listen.

761
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:13,197
Right now, you're my top choice
for this job,

762
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:16,067
but that can change
real fucking fast.

763
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:19,237
I put my ass on the line
even considering you,

764
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:21,206
so stow the attitude,

765
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,774
or the only job you're gonna
find in this city

766
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:25,778
is guarding a landfill
as a rent-a-cop.

767
00:42:25,812 --> 00:42:27,113
Look, I apologize.

768
00:42:27,147 --> 00:42:29,315
I didn't mean any disrespect.

769
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,951
It's just the other lieutenants
I've served under had, um--

770
00:42:31,986 --> 00:42:33,753
Dicks?

771
00:42:33,787 --> 00:42:35,655
Been around the block.

772
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:36,889
Trust me.

773
00:42:36,924 --> 00:42:39,625
This is just as weird for me
as it is for you.

774
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,860
Moving on.

775
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:44,395
Let's talk.

776
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:52,169
You know, I just
got my car out of the shop.

777
00:42:52,204 --> 00:42:54,138
What the hell is this?

778
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:57,608
This is the end, Walter.

779
00:42:57,642 --> 00:43:00,044
You pulled your last tooth.

780
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,046
How did I get here?

781
00:43:02,081 --> 00:43:03,147
Service entrance.

782
00:43:03,182 --> 00:43:05,951
I think I tweaked my back.

783
00:43:05,985 --> 00:43:08,520
Fuck me.

784
00:43:08,555 --> 00:43:10,322
You could have spent your
final days relaxing,

785
00:43:10,357 --> 00:43:15,393
enjoying life, but then
there was Rosalia Davolos.

786
00:43:15,428 --> 00:43:17,229
She's the first one
in ten years.

787
00:43:17,263 --> 00:43:20,332
Wasn't she?
Why now?

788
00:43:20,366 --> 00:43:23,835
I got tired of staring
at a box of teeth.

789
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:25,970
Took me ten minutes
to kill the whore.

790
00:43:26,005 --> 00:43:29,974
Lost another 20 trying
to pull the goddamn tooth.

791
00:43:34,814 --> 00:43:36,848
You know,
when I was in high school,

792
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:39,952
it seemed you were all
the country was talking about.

793
00:43:39,986 --> 00:43:41,220
The Tooth Fairy.

794
00:43:41,254 --> 00:43:42,989
Too clever for the police.

795
00:43:43,023 --> 00:43:44,490
They couldn't catch you.

796
00:43:44,525 --> 00:43:47,828
Like Burt Reynolds
with his Trans-Am.

797
00:43:47,862 --> 00:43:50,330
I still can't believe you
are the same man

798
00:43:50,365 --> 00:43:52,900
that dumped a body at
a deputy sheriff's house.

799
00:43:54,568 --> 00:43:57,203
Total fucking accident.

800
00:43:57,237 --> 00:43:59,272
I downed a few too many...

801
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:01,607
And didn't feel like driving
out to the highway

802
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:03,376
to get rid of the bitch.

803
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,977
That's disappointing.

804
00:44:05,012 --> 00:44:08,180
Well, I'm very fucking sorry
to let you down.

805
00:44:08,214 --> 00:44:10,349
Does that mean you
don't want my autograph?

806
00:44:10,383 --> 00:44:11,583
No.

807
00:44:11,617 --> 00:44:16,388
Just...this.

808
00:44:16,423 --> 00:44:18,023
I--I took teeth.

809
00:44:18,058 --> 00:44:19,491
You take blood.

810
00:44:19,526 --> 00:44:22,261
You're the same kind
of sick fuck, aren't you?

811
00:44:22,295 --> 00:44:24,196
At least I'm never gonna
end up like you.

812
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,564
Oh, yeah?

813
00:44:25,598 --> 00:44:29,568
When you can't do this anymore,
what do you have then?

814
00:44:29,603 --> 00:44:30,636
More.

815
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,805
You're kidding yourself,
asshole.

816
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:35,141
All I ever cared about
was killing,

817
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:37,076
and I can't even
do that right anymore.

818
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:39,445
That's what you've got
to look forward to.

819
00:44:39,479 --> 00:44:44,150
This is your future and it
includes adult fucking diapers!

820
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:45,584
You are not my future.

821
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:48,421
I will not spend my
final days getting drunk

822
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:50,689
and staring at
a box of trophies.

823
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:53,859
Keep telling yourself that.

824
00:44:53,893 --> 00:44:56,528
Make sure they know who I am.

825
00:44:56,563 --> 00:44:57,796
I wish I could see the look

826
00:44:57,831 --> 00:44:59,998
on my son's face
when he finds out.

827
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:03,902
He won't be able
to ignore that!

828
00:45:06,006 --> 00:45:08,774
I never want my son
to know who I was.

829
00:45:08,808 --> 00:45:11,878
You said you didn't have a kid.

830
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:14,881
I also said my name
was "Dan."

831
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:19,419
What are you doing?

832
00:45:19,453 --> 00:45:21,588
You're not gonna die
as the Tooth Fairy.

833
00:45:21,622 --> 00:45:23,757
You're gonna die as a sad,
old man...

834
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:24,958
of a heart attack.

835
00:45:24,992 --> 00:45:26,160
No!

836
00:45:27,529 --> 00:45:29,863
The latest resident
to check out

837
00:45:29,898 --> 00:45:32,800
of the Coral Island
retirement village.

838
00:45:49,817 --> 00:45:51,417
Walter Kenney's son
will never know

839
00:45:51,452 --> 00:45:54,154
his father was a monster.

840
00:45:54,188 --> 00:45:56,223
Or at least not a killer.

841
00:46:13,777 --> 00:46:17,279
We all want life to have some
kind of meaning.

842
00:46:26,322 --> 00:46:29,090
Seems like the older we get,
the harder we look for it...

843
00:46:44,608 --> 00:46:48,312
And the harder it is to find.

844
00:46:58,255 --> 00:47:03,492
And some of us just look
in the wrong place.

845
00:47:12,102 --> 00:47:16,439
But if our lives
don't have meaning...

846
00:47:16,473 --> 00:47:18,707
Horsey, daddy.

847
00:47:22,045 --> 00:47:25,514
What can we leave behind
for those we care about?

848
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:28,517
There you go, buddy.

849
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:44,967
Walter Kenney wanted
to pass on the ugliness

850
00:47:45,002 --> 00:47:46,765
that his life had become.

851
00:48:03,186 --> 00:48:05,150
What will I pass on?

852
00:48:13,764 --> 00:48:15,531
Ah!

853
00:48:32,883 --> 00:48:36,626
I don't know which slide
goes where, who's who.

854
00:48:37,176 --> 00:48:39,562
There's no order anymore.

855
