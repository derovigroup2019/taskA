2
00:01:46,934 --> 00:01:48,103
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:49,239
James Gellar.

4
00:01:49,357 --> 00:01:50,908
The professor from
the University of Tallahassee.

5
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,494
Gellar disappeared three years ago

6
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:53,594
after he got fired.

7
00:01:53,628 --> 00:01:55,162
You can't get in touch with him...

8
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:56,563
'Cause he went underground.

9
00:01:56,598 --> 00:01:58,298
You said Gellar does the killing.

10
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,733
He's so much stronger than me.

11
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:02,168
Gellar is pulling you
toward the darkness, Travis,

12
00:02:02,203 --> 00:02:03,337
not the light.

13
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:05,339
What you said to me made me think.

14
00:02:05,373 --> 00:02:06,674
Think what?

15
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,376
That I don't have to do what he says.

16
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:09,711
You're free.

17
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:11,113
So when Jessica Morris
O.D.'d,

18
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:13,282
there was definitely someone
in that hotel room with her.

19
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:14,617
No doubt.

20
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:17,754
Then why is Laguerta on my ass
to close this thing?

21
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:20,891
My God!

22
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:22,692
What the fuck?

23
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:26,196
Gellar hasn't seen wrath
until he's seen mine.

24
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:28,365
Travis.

25
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:36,940
Gellar.

26
00:02:36,975 --> 00:02:38,842
He's been dead all along.

27
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:41,011
Travis acted alone.

28
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:44,114
He killed all those people.

29
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:59,299
Travis is the only Doomsday Killer.

30
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,169
And I've made a terrible mistake.

31
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:30,467
Same kill wound as the other victims.

32
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,837
Which means--

33
00:03:35,307 --> 00:03:37,042
Travis.

34
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:41,113
You killed Gellar?

35
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:11,411
Professor Gellar.

36
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:13,580
It is not true.

37
00:04:13,614 --> 00:04:17,218
I did not kill you.

38
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:19,587
No! No.

39
00:04:19,621 --> 00:04:22,624
You did, Travis.

40
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:24,892
It's time you faced the truth
about yourself.

41
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:27,429
He thinks Gellar is still alive.

42
00:04:27,463 --> 00:04:29,997
Talking to someone who isn't there.

43
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:32,332
Huh.

44
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:35,736
I remember I came to your office.

45
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,004
I brought you
the John the Revelator sword.

46
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:40,172
Yeah, you'd stolen it.

47
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:42,941
University blamed me
and they fired me.

48
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:46,445
I told you we needed it.

49
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,948
Because we are the two witnesses...

50
00:04:48,983 --> 00:04:51,618
from Revelation 11.

51
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:53,820
And I told you you were delusional

52
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:55,022
and needed help.

53
00:04:55,057 --> 00:04:56,557
I convinced you.

54
00:04:56,592 --> 00:04:59,861
I made you see...

55
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:04,232
that we are the chosen ones.

56
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:06,968
I proved it to you
that you couldn't be hurt.

57
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:11,305
You stabbed me with the sword
three years ago.

58
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,508
And it couldn't pierce your flesh.

59
00:05:18,946 --> 00:05:22,315
No.

60
00:05:23,984 --> 00:05:26,653
I didn't do that.

61
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:30,557
You killed me, Travis.

62
00:05:30,592 --> 00:05:32,993
And then you stuck me in the freezer.

63
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,065
That didn't happen.

64
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,740
It was him.

65
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:47,776
The false prophet.
He killed you.

66
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:53,114
He's trying to stop
what God has commanded us to do!

67
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:57,452
And I will carry on without you.

68
00:05:57,486 --> 00:06:01,223
I will finish what we started.

69
00:06:01,257 --> 00:06:04,526
You were wrong, old man.

70
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,763
I'm in control now.

71
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:14,536
I will make new disciples
that will help me.

72
00:06:16,972 --> 00:06:22,043
I don't need you anymore.

73
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:24,079
Travis!

74
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:30,719
I have to stop him.

75
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,927
What happened to saving him?

76
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:39,263
Travis' Dark Passenger
is a part of him.

77
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:42,000
He can't be saved from it
anymore than I can from mine.

78
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,073
I should've never listened
to Brother Sam.

79
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,808
He was right about one thing.

80
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:54,547
If you put your faith
in the wrong thing--

81
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,216
It can really fuck you up.

82
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,919
It was a mistake
to put my faith in Travis.

83
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,556
From now on, I'm only
putting my faith in myself.

84
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:11,896
It's Deb.

85
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,698
The cops are canvassing
a one-mile radius

86
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,767
around the IP address
from Gellar's blog.

87
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:17,868
They're closing in.

88
00:07:17,902 --> 00:07:19,836
Maybe it's time to let this one go.

89
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,537
No!

90
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:23,172
The only way to kill a Dark Passenger

91
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:25,007
is to take out the driver.

92
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,677
After everything
Travis put me through,

93
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:30,747
he's mine.

94
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:37,019
What are you doing?

95
00:07:37,054 --> 00:07:38,321
If the cops find Gellar,

96
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:39,956
they'll focus the hunt on Travis.

97
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:44,294
It'll make it that much harder
for me to get to him.

98
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:47,564
I have to keep Gellar alive.

99
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:52,269
This is ghoulish, even for you.

100
00:07:52,303 --> 00:07:55,840
Well, if the cops found
only Travis' prints,

101
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:57,575
they'd get suspicious.

102
00:07:57,609 --> 00:08:02,580
This way, they'll find
Gellar's fingerprints too.

103
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:11,721
Once I'm done here, I just have
to strike the kill room,

104
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:14,790
dump Gellar's body in the swamp,

105
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:17,159
and head to Travis' motel.

106
00:08:17,193 --> 00:08:18,860
You really think he's there?

107
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:22,663
No, but it might help me
get in touch with him.

108
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:25,300
What about that?

109
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:29,671
Well, it's helped me once.
Maybe I could use it again.

110
00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:32,575
I'll stash it in the morgue
for a rainy day.

111
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:52,864
Gellar's blog.

112
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:55,499
You mean Travis' blog.

113
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:58,335
And now that I have Travis' laptop,

114
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,272
I can post as Gellar too.

115
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:02,540
Batting the beehive?

116
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:04,442
You sure that's a good idea?

117
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:06,210
Travis is unstable.

118
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:10,248
I need him to engage.

119
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:13,685
This should get his attention.

120
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,072
I'll do...anything...for you,
Dr. Gellar.

121
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:38,810
It's cool what you're doing,
killing all those people.

122
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,544
That's creepy.

123
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:43,380
Hey, Gellar.
It's the end times, huh?

124
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:45,683
Time for God's wrath.

125
00:09:45,717 --> 00:09:47,952
Well, I got some God's wrath...

126
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:50,889
Right here!

127
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,724
Oh, yeah!
End times!

128
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,260
God's wrath.

129
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:04,871
Dr. Gellar,
I've read all your stuff.

130
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:07,807
But I felt like you were
just cracking the surface.

131
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:10,676
Glad to see you man up,
take the next step.

132
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:14,513
People are always being killed
in the Bible.

133
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,181
But I'm with you...

134
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,084
Till the end of days.

135
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,593
Doomsday Killer's
in an abandoned church.

136
00:11:04,628 --> 00:11:07,196
It's too fucking perfect.

137
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:19,111
Holy fucking shit.
Is this it?

138
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,557
Are these Gellar's paintings?

139
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:36,694
It looks that way.

140
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:38,562
And this has to be where
Gellar and Travis

141
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:42,732
prepared their tableaus.

142
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:46,070
And held their victims.

143
00:11:46,104 --> 00:11:49,674
Holy Christ on a stick.

144
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,910
Sorry.

145
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,860
Deb.
You okay?

146
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,668
I'm fine.
I just need to...

147
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:19,607
get some air.

148
00:12:34,622 --> 00:12:36,723
What?
What?

149
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,057
Yeah.

150
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:40,092
Yeah, I'll be there.

151
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,914
The cops may have found his hideout,

152
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,749
but that won't stop Travis.

153
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,484
That's up to me.

154
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,354
I can't wait for him to respond
to the blog.

155
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,990
I have to figure out his next kill.

156
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,959
Dex, thank God you're here.

157
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:17,998
You okay?
You look kinda...sweaty.

158
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:20,234
I was fine until I went
into the church,

159
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:21,768
and all of a sudden...

160
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:24,872
my heart started racing
and I couldn't breathe.

161
00:13:24,907 --> 00:13:26,140
What the fuck?

162
00:13:26,174 --> 00:13:29,409
I've been to a million crime scenes.

163
00:13:29,444 --> 00:13:31,644
You remember that Ice Truck
Killer crime scene

164
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,948
when he filled the motel room
with blood?

165
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,782
- Yeah.
- I had a panic attack.

166
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,584
Is that what this is, a panic attack?

167
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:42,054
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe.

168
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:45,324
Well, what was yours about?

169
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,693
Reminded me of when my mom died.

170
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,862
Oh, right.

171
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,397
Fuck, obviously.
I'm sorry.

172
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:52,798
It's okay.

173
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,099
But that makes sense,

174
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,434
you freaking out about your mom.

175
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:57,336
Me, panicking at a crime scene?

176
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,206
I'm the fucking lieutenant
for Christ's sake.

177
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,908
I can't get all woozy here every
time I go to a crime scene.

178
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,477
Maybe you're pregnant.

179
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,645
First of all, fuck you.

180
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,147
And second of all,

181
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,749
that would be the immaculate
fucking conception,

182
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:13,019
since I haven't been with anyone
since Quinn.

183
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,688
And lastly, fuck you.

184
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:19,325
Sounds like you're feeling better.

185
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,695
Let's go.

186
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,533
Travis and Gellar were
busy fuckin' bees, huh?

187
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,337
Makes you wonder where God was

188
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,005
when they were up to all of this.

189
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,073
It was a mistake to think

190
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,008
that any of this religious garbage

191
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,977
could be an answer
to my Dark Passenger.

192
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,611
There's no solution here.

193
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:42,781
Only clues to finding Travis.

194
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,749
The paintings.

195
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,818
We got the seven-headed
serpent...

196
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,687
the four horsemen...

197
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,221
the angel.

198
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,891
Quinn, nice of you to join us.

199
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,893
The Whore of Babylon,
the Bowls of Wrath.

200
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:58,829
And the sixth one...

201
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:02,532
Wormwood.

202
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:04,067
What the fuck's a wormwood?

203
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:05,668
Perhaps how I find Travis.

204
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:08,504
It's the next sacrifice.

205
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:10,840
Something about a star
that crashes down to the earth

206
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,209
and poisons mankind.

207
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:15,711
Mankind?
Think this one'll be bigger?

208
00:15:15,746 --> 00:15:18,380
Well, they used one body
for the four horsemen

209
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:19,849
they're not exactly going for literal.

210
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:21,951
All right, we need to find
the who, the what,

211
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:26,623
and the where of this A.S.A.P.

212
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:27,957
Lieutenant Morgan.

213
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:29,893
Who are you going to poison, Travis?

214
00:15:29,927 --> 00:15:32,830
Hey, Dex, there's blood.

215
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,069
Think these could be from
the Bowls of Wrath?

216
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,404
Could be.
Let's test it

217
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,773
against the samples
we took from the crime scene.

218
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,643
Thank you, sir.

219
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:52,450
Everything okay?

220
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:56,187
Matthews wants to set up
a dinner sometime this week.

221
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:59,558
Someplace fancy.

222
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,961
It sounds like he's inviting
you into his inner circle.

223
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:07,699
Congratulations.
You're big time.

224
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,035
Yeah, right.

225
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:17,240
Now that I've done my job,
I can get on with my work.

226
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:19,443
That looks promising.

227
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:22,145
There's some more jars over there.

228
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:25,214
I'll get it.

229
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,625
Travis Marshall.

230
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,704
Dr. Benjamin Carlson,
from Miami.

231
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,405
What do you got?

232
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,141
Just some paint thinner.

233
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,110
What the fuck is chlorpromazine?

234
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,378
Hey, Anderson.

235
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,080
Okay, I'll get back at you.

236
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:58,949
Get a line on
Dr. Benjamin Carlson.

237
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,918
Think Travis was a patient of his.

238
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:02,953
Got it.

239
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:07,724
At least I still have Gellar's blog.

240
00:17:07,758 --> 00:17:10,828
The prodigal son has returned.

241
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:13,696
"False Prophet."
He's talking to me.

242
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:15,898
I listened to you once
and I made a mistake,

243
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,333
but never again.

244
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:19,835
I'm going to fix it.

245
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,204
What's his mistake?

246
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:26,108
Was it straying from Gellar
and listening to me?

247
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:32,649
I'm psyched you could do breakfast.

248
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:34,685
One of the perks of being a nanny.

249
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,655
Two hours off while Harrison's
in preschool.

250
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,657
I need a little advice.

251
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,760
I really want to show Dexter
my video game, you know,

252
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,062
find out what a real blood
spatter analyst thinks of it.

253
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,864
Good idea.

254
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,466
I have never seen the guy
make a mistake, like, ever.

255
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:51,069
- So you want to impress him.
- Yeah.

256
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,471
I mean, he's--
he's kind of intense.

257
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,706
Babe, I don't know
what he's like at work,

258
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,142
but once you seen him reading
<i>Everybody Poops</i> to Harrison,

259
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:02,979
you realize he's a big softie.

260
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:05,414
Just talk to him.

261
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:09,586
Lieutenant?

262
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,189
I have the personal effects
of Jessica Morris.

263
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:13,357
You asked for them.

264
00:18:13,391 --> 00:18:15,326
Oh, right, fuck.
The dead call girl.

265
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,762
Um...

266
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,332
Just put 'em in my office.
I'll look at it later.

267
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,901
Okay.

268
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,037
Still looking into that case.

269
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,005
We've been through this.
I'm just doing my job.

270
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,342
You're not.
That's the problem.

271
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:34,879
I need to figure out
what Travis needs to fix.

272
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,448
What exactly is wormwood...

273
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:40,684
and who will his victim be?

274
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,020
Okay, people, big day,
so let's get started.

275
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:45,256
Are you running the briefing?

276
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,258
Doomsday is our most
important investigation,

277
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,228
and the more I help out
the more time you'll have

278
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,497
to focus on other cases.

279
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:56,569
You're the boss.

280
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:58,538
- You okay?
- Peachy fucking keen.

281
00:18:58,572 --> 00:18:59,872
So I understand that

282
00:18:59,907 --> 00:19:02,442
we found Doomsday's hideout.
Where was it?

283
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,045
- In an abandoned church.
- Great.

284
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,080
Bring me up to speed.

285
00:19:07,115 --> 00:19:08,915
I, uh, found a hidden cellar.

286
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:11,217
I was sure it was gonna be
filled with body parts

287
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:14,386
but there was just some church
crap and an old freezer.

288
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:15,954
Sorry to disappoint you.

289
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,557
Dexter?
Masuka?

290
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:22,560
Place was covered in prints
from Travis and Gellar.

291
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,961
What about the blood in the jars?

292
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:25,095
What jars?

293
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:26,630
We found bloody jars
in the trash. Dex?

294
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:28,699
Same type as Travis',

295
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,501
and it matched some
of the samples we took

296
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:31,835
from the Bowls of Wrath.

297
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,339
I was thinking Holly Benson,
the girl who escaped.

298
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:37,574
She thought they made her drink blood.

299
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,109
Maybe it was from those jars.

300
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:43,581
Holly Benson didn't escape.
Travis let her go because of me.

301
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:46,584
Anderson, what do you got?
Anything else?

302
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:51,789
Could she be the mistake
Travis was talking about?

303
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,524
The mistake he needs to fix.

304
00:19:55,726 --> 00:20:00,196
Travis is already back
on Gellar's path.

305
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:03,600
Will Holly be his victim
in the Wormwood tableau?

306
00:20:03,634 --> 00:20:07,637
If I find Holly,
hopefully I'll find Travis.

307
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:13,676
Dexter. Hey!

308
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,078
Jamie and I went
to your donut shop this morning.

309
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:17,547
Not now, Louis.

310
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,367
It's--it's you.

311
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,736
And you're Doomsday Adam.

312
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:43,006
It's just I--
I never...imagined--

313
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,541
Steve Dorsey.

314
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:47,277
This is such an honor.

315
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:50,346
It's nice to meet you too, Steve.

316
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,215
Do you mind if I come in?
I'm kind of being hunted.

317
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:54,283
Oh, right!
Yep, please.

318
00:20:54,318 --> 00:20:56,286
Come on in.

319
00:20:58,088 --> 00:21:00,523
Beth, get in here and meet our guest.

320
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,826
Well, I hope he's hungry.

321
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:06,363
I have snacks.

322
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:08,299
Oh, my--

323
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,267
How about that?

324
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:12,069
Travis Marshall.

325
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:13,471
It's a pleasure to meet you, Beth.

326
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:17,642
Oh, I know who you are.
I've seen you on the news.

327
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,878
Is Professor Gellar coming too?

328
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:22,414
No. Not today.

329
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,617
We were just so confused by his blog.

330
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,652
He said this was all
the Devil's errand.

331
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,787
Professor Gellar didn't write that.

332
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,222
It was a false prophet

333
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,757
trying to throw a monkey wrench
into God's plan.

334
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,926
I knew it.

335
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,962
Well, please sit down.

336
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:42,799
Sorry I just have, um,
Velveeta and crackers.

337
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:48,238
Steve's been out of work lately and...

338
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,640
I know how it is.

339
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:54,479
Sometimes it feels as if
God has forgotten us.

340
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:59,152
But I'm here to tell you
that your time has come.

341
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:01,054
The faithful will be given

342
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:04,625
untold riches in God's new kingdom...

343
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:08,862
If you trust and obey.

344
00:22:08,897 --> 00:22:11,031
We're ready,
Mr. Marshall.

345
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:13,500
We'll do whatever you say.

346
00:22:13,535 --> 00:22:16,637
Good.

347
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:19,040
But first, I need to know
that you're fully committed.

348
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:26,314
Holly Benson's apartment--
the victim who would've been.

349
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:28,716
I can stake the place out.

350
00:22:28,751 --> 00:22:32,153
Wait and see if Travis shows up.

351
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:38,495
Aren't you putting a lot
of eggs in the Holly basket?

352
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:41,464
I'm trusting my instincts.

353
00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:45,802
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

354
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:53,376
Doesn't look like she's here.

355
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,811
What if Travis got to her first?

356
00:22:55,845 --> 00:23:01,049
There's no signs
of a struggle or a break-in.

357
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:05,653
Not an ounce of makeup.
No hairbrush, no toothbrush.

358
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:08,090
She could've packed a bag,
gone out of town.

359
00:23:08,124 --> 00:23:09,591
She still won't be safe.

360
00:23:09,626 --> 00:23:11,761
Travis is determined to find her
wherever she is.

361
00:23:11,795 --> 00:23:16,867
Which is why I have to
make sure I find her first.

362
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:21,572
Come on, Holly.
Give me something I can use.

363
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:23,241
Something else.

364
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:26,644
Who would she be with?
Family? Friends?

365
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:30,114
Boyfriend.

366
00:23:30,148 --> 00:23:32,449
I bet he knows where she is.

367
00:23:32,483 --> 00:23:37,086
Peter Grant.
I'm guessing this is him.

368
00:24:00,578 --> 00:24:03,146
Hi, I'm looking for, uh, Peter Grant.

369
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,148
Oh, my dad.

370
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:06,650
Is he at home?

371
00:24:06,684 --> 00:24:10,320
Does it look like I have
parental supervision?

372
00:24:10,354 --> 00:24:13,657
He's off in Spain...
Or Portugal maybe.

373
00:24:13,691 --> 00:24:16,560
Can you tell me if he knows
a woman named Holly Benson?

374
00:24:16,594 --> 00:24:19,897
She's my dad's "sex-retary."
Why?

375
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:23,100
I, uh--I'm a friend.

376
00:24:23,135 --> 00:24:24,635
Can't seem to get in touch with her.

377
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:26,770
Yeah, well, no offense,
but your friend

378
00:24:26,805 --> 00:24:29,373
is a total slam-pig.

379
00:24:29,408 --> 00:24:33,244
Right. Slam-pig.
Any idea where I can find her?

380
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:34,912
I don't know.
The yacht maybe?

381
00:24:34,947 --> 00:24:36,280
Yacht?

382
00:24:36,314 --> 00:24:37,815
My dad has this boat
that he refuses to get rid of.

383
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:41,118
Probably some kind of fuck pad.

384
00:24:41,152 --> 00:24:42,820
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

385
00:24:42,854 --> 00:24:44,688
On the water somewhere.

386
00:24:44,722 --> 00:24:45,689
Thanks.

387
00:24:45,724 --> 00:24:47,258
If you do find her, though,

388
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:49,260
will you give her a message for me?

389
00:24:55,735 --> 00:24:57,903
Nice kid.

390
00:24:57,938 --> 00:25:00,073
But if she's right and Holly's
out on a boat alone,

391
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:03,109
she's a sitting duck for Travis.

392
00:25:03,144 --> 00:25:05,711
Time to play
"Find the Fuck Pad."

393
00:25:05,746 --> 00:25:07,313
He's in Spain with his wife.

394
00:25:07,347 --> 00:25:09,915
If he was lying, would he
let me crash on his boat

395
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,117
while he's away?

396
00:25:13,486 --> 00:25:17,389
Who asked you anyway?
I got to go.

397
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:56,031
Hello?

398
00:26:03,301 --> 00:26:05,369
Who's there?

399
00:26:05,403 --> 00:26:07,537
Hello, whore.

400
00:26:19,684 --> 00:26:22,185
Shh.

401
00:26:22,219 --> 00:26:24,420
We're going for a little cruise.

402
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,643
What the fuck?

403
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:52,881
- You're a fucking asshole.
- I'm an asshole?

404
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,916
Doomsday's out there searching
for his next victim

405
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:57,386
and you're asleep on the job.

406
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,520
What are you, fucking SuperCop?

407
00:26:58,555 --> 00:27:00,956
No.
I give a shit.

408
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:02,726
Maybe you should try it for once,

409
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,694
instead of going out drinking
every night

410
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:06,529
and coming to work while messed up.

411
00:27:06,563 --> 00:27:08,998
- Give it a fucking rest, man.
- So what...

412
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:10,166
Your girlfriend broke up with you.

413
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:11,601
- Get over it.
- Fuck that.

414
00:27:11,635 --> 00:27:13,403
I'm just being
a single guy having fun.

415
00:27:13,437 --> 00:27:15,872
- You should try it for once.
- Hey.

416
00:27:15,906 --> 00:27:17,840
Any leads on a Wormwood victim?

417
00:27:17,874 --> 00:27:19,575
We're going over to Gellar's
and Travis'

418
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,711
friends, relatives, and acquaintances.

419
00:27:21,745 --> 00:27:23,946
Figure the last two victims
were personal.

420
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,280
Good thinking.
Keep at it.

421
00:27:25,315 --> 00:27:27,049
Any luck
on the Dr. Carlson front?

422
00:27:27,084 --> 00:27:29,018
Turns out he passed away
a couple years ago,

423
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:30,453
but I got a court order

424
00:27:30,488 --> 00:27:32,455
releasing Travis Marshall's
psych eval.

425
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,591
Drugs were antipsychotics.

426
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:36,927
Apparently he had some
breaks with reality.

427
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:39,262
Jesus. Violent tendencies
since childhood,

428
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:40,664
a lack of empathy,

429
00:27:40,698 --> 00:27:43,033
master manipulator,
delusions of grandeur.

430
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:44,267
It makes sense.

431
00:27:44,302 --> 00:27:45,669
Fucker wants to end the world.

432
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:46,970
What's that?

433
00:27:47,004 --> 00:27:48,038
Travis' psych file.

434
00:27:48,072 --> 00:27:50,140
More like psych-o file.

435
00:27:50,174 --> 00:27:52,108
The guy was complete sociopath.

436
00:27:52,143 --> 00:27:54,677
Shit, it says here the shrink
thought he killed his parents.

437
00:27:54,712 --> 00:27:56,146
I thought it was a car accident.

438
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,247
Or not.

439
00:27:57,281 --> 00:27:58,848
Apparently Travis attacked his father

440
00:27:58,883 --> 00:28:00,751
and grabbed the wheel.

441
00:28:00,785 --> 00:28:03,888
Turned it right into a tree.

442
00:28:03,922 --> 00:28:05,623
Any signs of parental abuse?

443
00:28:05,658 --> 00:28:08,326
Mm-mm.
It's so weird.

444
00:28:08,361 --> 00:28:10,095
His sister seemed so convinced
he was a good guy.

445
00:28:10,129 --> 00:28:13,032
Maybe she didn't know.

446
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,001
Anything's possible.

447
00:28:16,035 --> 00:28:21,741
He's been a monster from the start.

448
00:28:21,775 --> 00:28:25,211
He's using Gellar
to justify his kills.

449
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:27,314
A lot of people justify their kills.

450
00:28:27,348 --> 00:28:31,884
You mean me?
You justified my kills.

451
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,619
You taught me the code.

452
00:28:33,653 --> 00:28:35,387
I kept you from becoming your brother.

453
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:38,456
Making me a killer
was the best you could do.

454
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:40,225
You were already gonna be a killer.

455
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:44,663
I guess we'll never know.

456
00:28:44,697 --> 00:28:47,232
There it is.

457
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:48,466
The fuck pad.

458
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:51,202
<i>The Ricochet Rabbit.</i>

459
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:57,274
Where you going?

460
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:00,711
I know this marina.

461
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:05,383
I had a freak-out
at a crime scene today.

462
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:07,584
Is that unusual?

463
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:11,188
Yes, that's unusual.

464
00:29:11,223 --> 00:29:12,657
Seen a lot of fucked up shit

465
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:14,893
and it usually just rolls right off.

466
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:17,229
But not today.

467
00:29:17,263 --> 00:29:18,597
You know what's even weirder

468
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,931
is the stuff that usually fucks me up

469
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,900
- didn't even phase me today.
- Like what?

470
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:24,103
Like Laguerta trying to swing
her dick around

471
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,270
in the briefing room.

472
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,538
I handled that like a champ.

473
00:29:26,572 --> 00:29:29,874
Well, that's fantastic.

474
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:34,545
So why did I lose my shit
when I walked into that church?

475
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:36,713
Did the church have some kind
of significance for you?

476
00:29:36,748 --> 00:29:38,148
I don't know.

477
00:29:38,182 --> 00:29:40,683
The only time I go to church
is to go to a funeral, you know?

478
00:29:40,718 --> 00:29:43,886
My mom, my dad...

479
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,090
boyfriends,
my sister-in-law.

480
00:29:47,124 --> 00:29:51,462
So you associate church with loss.

481
00:29:51,496 --> 00:29:54,932
I guess.

482
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:56,567
Whatever.
Doesn't matter.

483
00:29:56,602 --> 00:29:58,604
My brother showed up,
he calmed me down.

484
00:29:58,638 --> 00:30:00,806
Dexter?

485
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,274
Was it something that he said?

486
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:05,111
Um...

487
00:30:05,145 --> 00:30:07,413
I guess.

488
00:30:07,447 --> 00:30:10,048
Not really.

489
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:14,987
It was more just him being there.

490
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,756
Come to think of it...

491
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:22,960
Every time the shit hits
the fan, I go to him.

492
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:24,495
I've even moved in with him
a few times.

493
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:27,299
- He's your safe place.
- Yeah.

494
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:29,502
Since we were kids.

495
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:34,474
I used to have these nightmares,
and...

496
00:30:34,508 --> 00:30:40,281
I would sneak into his room
and I'd curl up on the floor.

497
00:30:40,315 --> 00:30:42,483
He wouldn't even know I was there.

498
00:30:46,689 --> 00:30:48,457
Is that weird?

499
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:50,458
I don't know.

500
00:30:50,493 --> 00:30:52,661
Do you think it's weird?

501
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:59,902
Not really.
He's my brother.

502
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:02,337
I think it's sweet.

503
00:31:09,212 --> 00:31:12,414
What are you gonna do?

504
00:31:12,449 --> 00:31:14,684
You mean, what are <i>we</i> going to do.

505
00:31:14,718 --> 00:31:16,719
We're going to kill her, Beth.

506
00:31:16,753 --> 00:31:18,488
Oh!

507
00:31:18,522 --> 00:31:19,889
He's testing our faith.

508
00:31:19,924 --> 00:31:21,724
Like Abraham.

509
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:23,426
You've got it easy.

510
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,762
He was asked to sacrifice his son.

511
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:27,797
You just have to pitch in
and help kill a whore.

512
00:31:27,831 --> 00:31:30,132
I don't think I can do that.

513
00:31:34,237 --> 00:31:37,206
I understand, Beth.

514
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,309
But you'll be purifying her sins.

515
00:31:40,343 --> 00:31:43,245
Her soul will know paradise
because of your strength,

516
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,315
your love.

517
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:48,684
Come on.

518
00:31:48,718 --> 00:31:50,486
Let's show her some love.

519
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:24,183
Oh. Hey, Dexter!

520
00:32:24,218 --> 00:32:27,820
Louis got here a little early
to pick me up for our date.

521
00:32:27,854 --> 00:32:30,623
You have a date?
I was hoping you could stay.

522
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,525
Sorry.

523
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,829
I don't supposed you'd wanna
have your date here.

524
00:32:35,864 --> 00:32:37,231
We can't.

525
00:32:37,265 --> 00:32:41,202
Louis bought us tickets
to go see the Avett Brothers.

526
00:32:41,237 --> 00:32:42,370
Can't go another time?

527
00:32:42,405 --> 00:32:43,938
They're only playing tonight.

528
00:32:48,678 --> 00:32:50,412
Hey, Dexter.

529
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:53,348
Uh...I was wondering
if maybe

530
00:32:53,383 --> 00:32:55,251
you could take a look at my game
before we go.

531
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:56,652
I mean, if it's not a bad time.

532
00:32:56,687 --> 00:32:58,955
I should probably put Harrison down.

533
00:32:58,989 --> 00:33:00,890
Oh, I got him.
You take it easy.

534
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:03,794
Looks like you had a long day at work.

535
00:33:07,198 --> 00:33:08,698
Daddy.

536
00:33:12,136 --> 00:33:15,405
So...
Looks like you have a minute.

537
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:19,509
- Looks like I do.
- Awesome.

538
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:21,779
I'll just--I'll bring the game
up on my laptop.

539
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:26,650
Uh, so...the game...

540
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:28,219
is about homicide.

541
00:33:28,253 --> 00:33:29,554
And I know there's, like,

542
00:33:29,588 --> 00:33:31,155
a million video games out there
about that.

543
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,258
But the secret
to this game is--

544
00:33:33,292 --> 00:33:34,759
and I haven't even told Jamie
this yet--

545
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:37,962
but in my game...
you can be...

546
00:33:37,997 --> 00:33:40,665
the serial killer.

547
00:33:42,568 --> 00:33:44,702
What?

548
00:33:44,737 --> 00:33:46,771
See, you have these character choices.

549
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:52,043
You can be, uh, Dahmer,
Jack the Ripper,

550
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:53,911
the Bay Harbor Butcher.

551
00:33:53,946 --> 00:33:56,214
I <i>am</i> the Bay Harbor Butcher.

552
00:33:56,248 --> 00:33:58,483
So...

553
00:33:58,517 --> 00:34:02,221
What do you think?

554
00:34:02,255 --> 00:34:04,289
I think this is offensive.

555
00:34:06,693 --> 00:34:11,764
Who would choose
to be a serial killer?

556
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:16,469
Well, I mean,
it's like a vicarious thrill.

557
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:20,975
Vicarious thrill?

558
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:23,611
How could you possibly know
what it's like to take a life?

559
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:26,214
Why would you even want to?

560
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:32,120
It's a bad idea.
Do something else.

561
00:34:38,727 --> 00:34:42,163
So?

562
00:34:42,197 --> 00:34:45,866
I'm not--
I'm not feeling well.

563
00:34:45,901 --> 00:34:48,735
I think I should go home.

564
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,336
And miss the show?

565
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:53,239
I'm sorry.
I'm not, uh--

566
00:34:53,273 --> 00:34:56,041
I'm not up to it.

567
00:34:59,945 --> 00:35:02,680
Still need a sitter?

568
00:35:07,318 --> 00:35:10,421
This is the spot, but no boat.

569
00:35:10,455 --> 00:35:12,957
Which means Holly is probably on it.

570
00:35:12,991 --> 00:35:16,760
Unfortunately, Travis may be with her.

571
00:35:17,962 --> 00:35:19,896
Only one way to know for sure.

572
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:24,234
Check the security camera footage.

573
00:35:56,034 --> 00:36:00,905
I guess we all tell lies
about ourselves.

574
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,874
Security video archives.

575
00:36:26,669 --> 00:36:29,671
Travis.

576
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:41,650
It's got sea tracker
and the password is...

577
00:36:41,684 --> 00:36:43,852
Neptune.

578
00:36:43,887 --> 00:36:46,354
Thank you, Mr. Grant.
How can I help you tonight?

579
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:48,790
Yeah, I kinda have a problem.

580
00:36:48,824 --> 00:36:50,625
My girlfriend and I got into a fight

581
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,894
and she took off with my boat
and I don't know where she went.

582
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:54,495
I have the coordinates right here.

583
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,564
I'll notify the police.

584
00:36:56,598 --> 00:36:58,699
Any way around that?

585
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,167
Sorry, sir, it's protocol.

586
00:37:00,202 --> 00:37:01,735
I know...

587
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,904
It's just...I don't think
my wife would be too thrilled

588
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:07,708
to find out about my girlfriend.

589
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:09,409
I understand.

590
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:11,578
She's got a bit of a jump on you.

591
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:15,282
I've got her location right here.

592
00:37:53,452 --> 00:37:57,722
This...is Wormwood.

593
00:37:59,357 --> 00:38:01,391
I thought it would be bigger.

594
00:38:01,425 --> 00:38:03,393
- So we're ready?
- Not yet.

595
00:38:03,427 --> 00:38:06,196
We have to cover our tracks.
Police will find this place.

596
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,198
What difference does it make?

597
00:38:08,232 --> 00:38:09,899
The world's ending in four days.
It doesn't--

598
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:13,770
It will only end
if we complete our work.

599
00:38:13,804 --> 00:38:16,206
That can't happen if we're in jail.

600
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:19,743
God never said this would be easy.

601
00:38:41,097 --> 00:38:44,399
Jessica Morris.

602
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:48,003
Guilt trip from beyond the grave.

603
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,044
"Meet me at our usual spot tonight.

604
00:38:55,078 --> 00:38:58,748
Love and hot kisses,
T."

605
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:04,755
Sal's Flowers.
Sal speaking.

606
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,157
Hi, this is lieutenant Debra Morgan

607
00:39:06,191 --> 00:39:07,492
from Miami Metro Homicide.

608
00:39:07,526 --> 00:39:09,794
I need to know if you recently
delivered flowers

609
00:39:09,828 --> 00:39:13,064
to a Jessica Morris, sent by
someone with the initial "T."

610
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:15,534
Jessica Morris.

611
00:39:15,568 --> 00:39:17,970
Here it is--dozen red,
delivered morning of the 18th.

612
00:39:18,004 --> 00:39:20,839
Uh, that was the day she died.
Who sent them?

613
00:39:20,874 --> 00:39:25,311
Oh, my God.
Uh, it was Thomas Matthews.

614
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:28,881
I'm sorry,
did you say Thomas Matthews?

615
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:31,918
Uh, what's his phone number?

616
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:36,323
305-454-8537?

617
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,829
Jesus Christ.
Thank you.

618
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:53,908
Hey, Deb, what's up?

619
00:39:53,943 --> 00:39:55,276
I have a situation.
Can we talk?

620
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:56,477
What is it?

621
00:39:56,512 --> 00:39:59,012
Not on the phone.
When are you coming in?

622
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:01,414
Um, not for a while.

623
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:03,516
I have some personal stuff
to take care of.

624
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,317
- Before you get mad--
- It's okay.

625
00:40:05,352 --> 00:40:07,820
- It is?
- Yes.

626
00:40:07,854 --> 00:40:09,088
You have your own life to deal with.

627
00:40:09,122 --> 00:40:11,057
It seems to be filled with a fuckload

628
00:40:11,091 --> 00:40:14,393
of mysterious personal stuff, but...

629
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:15,628
whatever.

630
00:40:15,662 --> 00:40:18,431
Well...thanks for being
so understanding.

631
00:40:18,465 --> 00:40:20,099
Well, I'm sorry I wasn't before.

632
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:21,234
You've got my back when it counts.

633
00:40:21,268 --> 00:40:22,835
- I know that.
- Okay.

634
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,337
By the way, you were right

635
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:26,740
about that whole
panic attack thing, so...

636
00:40:26,774 --> 00:40:30,043
thank you.

637
00:40:30,077 --> 00:40:31,111
I'm gonna get off the phone now

638
00:40:31,145 --> 00:40:32,678
so that I can have another one.

639
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:34,947
I'll see you when you get in, okay?

640
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:53,132
Louis.
You're here early.

641
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,667
Uh, I couldn't sleep.

642
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,803
I...got a lot on my mind.

643
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:59,572
Um, I think I found a new lead.

644
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:02,742
This guy--Doomsday Adam.

645
00:41:02,776 --> 00:41:04,777
He keeps posting on Gellar's blog.

646
00:41:04,812 --> 00:41:07,747
To all of professor Gellar's
faithful followers.

647
00:41:07,781 --> 00:41:09,482
I can now tell you without a doubt

648
00:41:09,516 --> 00:41:12,085
that his prophecies are real.

649
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,787
My wife Beth and I have been chosen

650
00:41:13,821 --> 00:41:15,255
to be soldiers in the final battle.

651
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:19,526
And with God's help,
we will prove worthy.

652
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,962
This will be our last post.

653
00:41:21,996 --> 00:41:24,999
See you in Paradise.

654
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,201
You think maybe Gellar
and Travis got to this guy

655
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:29,337
and enlisted his help?

656
00:41:29,371 --> 00:41:30,672
I know it's a long shot,
but--

657
00:41:30,706 --> 00:41:34,176
It's worth checking out.

658
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,578
You think you could track down

659
00:41:35,612 --> 00:41:38,147
Doomsday Adam's real name and address?

660
00:41:38,182 --> 00:41:41,117
His name is Steve Dorsey.

661
00:41:41,152 --> 00:41:44,154
Here's his address.

662
00:41:44,188 --> 00:41:46,356
Good work.

663
00:41:46,391 --> 00:41:49,826
I'll call Quinn, go check it out.

664
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,497
At least someone around here
appreciates me.

665
00:41:58,335 --> 00:42:00,336
Hey, it's Quinn.

666
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:05,141
For the fourth fuckin' time,
answer your phone.

667
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:07,977
I'm not calling again, just get here.

668
00:42:27,431 --> 00:42:30,534
Sergeant Batista,
Miami Metro Homicide.

669
00:42:30,568 --> 00:42:34,438
- Are you Mrs. Beth Dorsey?
- Yes, that's right.

670
00:42:34,473 --> 00:42:36,341
Is your husband home?

671
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:38,543
No, he's not.
Is there something wrong?

672
00:42:38,578 --> 00:42:40,112
I'd like to ask you a few questions

673
00:42:40,146 --> 00:42:42,047
if you don't mind.

674
00:42:42,082 --> 00:42:45,618
Are you aware that your husband
has been posting on a blog

675
00:42:45,652 --> 00:42:47,386
by a Professor Gellar?

676
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:51,424
Mm, gosh, maybe you should
talk to him when he gets back.

677
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:54,560
How about we start with you
and we take it from there?

678
00:43:13,612 --> 00:43:17,214
Found the fuck pad.

679
00:43:17,248 --> 00:43:20,617
Travis.

680
00:43:20,651 --> 00:43:24,486
Why is he in a Hazmat suit?

681
00:44:01,925 --> 00:44:04,627
You're too late.

682
00:44:04,661 --> 00:44:06,796
Wormwood can't be stopped.

683
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,964
No!

684
00:44:12,102 --> 00:44:15,771
This was supposed to set things right.

685
00:44:18,608 --> 00:44:21,009
So you're telling me
that this was all a joke?

686
00:44:21,044 --> 00:44:23,712
The videos your husband posted
as Doomsday Adam,

687
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:25,781
the whole...chosen thing?

688
00:44:25,815 --> 00:44:28,483
My husband has kind of
a strange sense of humor.

689
00:44:28,518 --> 00:44:29,851
Yeah, I would say so.

690
00:44:29,886 --> 00:44:31,987
Steve's been out of work lately.

691
00:44:32,021 --> 00:44:34,957
He was hoping the videos
might go viral

692
00:44:34,991 --> 00:44:36,124
and get him some attention,

693
00:44:36,158 --> 00:44:37,525
and I just wanted to be supportive.

694
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:38,926
Mrs. Dorsey,

695
00:44:38,961 --> 00:44:42,129
these murders are nothing
to be joking around about.

696
00:44:42,163 --> 00:44:44,965
Your husband wasted valuable
police time

697
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:46,599
and resources that could've been spent

698
00:44:46,634 --> 00:44:48,535
catching the Doomsday Killers.

699
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:50,504
I am so sorry.

700
00:44:50,538 --> 00:44:53,841
I will talk to Steve--tell him
to get those videos down.

701
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:56,310
This will not happen again.

702
00:44:56,344 --> 00:44:59,314
I'd appreciate that.

703
00:45:12,162 --> 00:45:14,529
If this was all a joke,

704
00:45:14,563 --> 00:45:17,732
why do you have all these books
by Professor James Gellar?

705
00:45:22,537 --> 00:45:25,005
What are we gonna do?
He's a cop.

706
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:27,740
He doesn't enforce God's law.

707
00:45:27,775 --> 00:45:30,310
We do.

708
00:45:30,344 --> 00:45:33,513
It's a sign.

709
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,983
Miami Metro Homicide.

710
00:45:38,018 --> 00:45:40,519
That's where God wants us
to stage Wormwood.

711
00:45:44,424 --> 00:45:46,525
Nothing to tell you
what Wormwood is going to be.

712
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:48,327
I don't care what it's gonna be,

713
00:45:48,362 --> 00:45:51,330
I wanna know <i>where</i> it's gonna be.

714
00:45:51,365 --> 00:45:53,700
I have to fix this.

715
00:46:29,035 --> 00:46:30,536
Holly.

716
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,371
But this doesn't look like Wormwood.

717
00:46:32,405 --> 00:46:34,139
She was stabbed, not poisoned.

718
00:46:34,174 --> 00:46:36,041
You're still too late.
She's already dead.

719
00:46:36,076 --> 00:46:38,777
Travis is gone and you killed
the wrong guy.

720
00:46:38,812 --> 00:46:40,479
When you gonna let this go?

721
00:46:40,513 --> 00:46:42,681
When I kill Travis.

722
00:46:42,715 --> 00:46:44,182
Are you sure you can make that happen?

723
00:46:44,217 --> 00:46:45,817
Isn't that what you taught me to do?

724
00:46:45,852 --> 00:46:47,519
I didn't have a choice.

725
00:46:47,553 --> 00:46:50,554
According to you,
I don't have one either.

726
00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:52,056
Well, you have a choice
to make right now.

727
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,391
Maybe you should call the police.

728
00:46:54,425 --> 00:46:56,793
I told you, I don't call the police.

729
00:46:56,827 --> 00:46:58,995
Travis is mine.

730
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:01,431
Dexter, don't make this personal.

731
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:10,807
Methylphosphonyl difluoride?

732
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:12,276
And isopropyl alcohol.

733
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:14,645
Mix them together, they're lethal.

734
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:20,285
Poison gas.
This is Wormwood.

735
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,554
This could kill
who knows how many people.

736
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,157
Dexter, you have to call the police.

737
00:47:25,192 --> 00:47:27,459
Why would I listen to you?
I'm only here because of you.

738
00:47:27,494 --> 00:47:29,595
Now I'm supposed to trust
your judgment?

739
00:47:29,629 --> 00:47:31,263
- I'll make my own decision.
- Dex.

740
00:47:31,298 --> 00:47:34,934
Leave me alone!

741
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,374
Brother Sam said it.

742
00:47:42,408 --> 00:47:44,343
Sometimes you have to surrender

743
00:47:44,377 --> 00:47:46,311
to something greater than yourself.

744
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,516
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

745
00:47:50,551 --> 00:47:52,419
The Doomsday Killers
are hiding out on a yacht

746
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:54,988
at 114 Bleaker Canal Road.

747
00:47:55,022 --> 00:47:56,424
And who's calling please?

748
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:58,125
I'd rather not leave my name.

749
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,184
Hurry.
They have poison gas.

750
00:48:04,816 --> 00:48:15,635
