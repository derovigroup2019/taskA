00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,134
What'd they make you drink?

359
00:21:20,168 --> 00:21:23,034
It was cold, and it made me puke.

360
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:26,700
And it tasted like metal.
I think it was blood.

361
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:33,034
There's probably no way
to get a sample of that blood,

362
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:34,300
but we should run it all past Dexter.

363
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,268
Jamie said she was watching
Harrison for a few days.

364
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,834
Yeah, Dex said he needed a break,

365
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:40,567
so he just took off.

366
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,067
I get that.

367
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,834
Did Jamie mention where he was going?

368
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:45,801
No, but it was part
of a larger conversation

369
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:48,001
about a date she has...
with Louis.

370
00:21:48,034 --> 00:21:49,201
Masuka's intern?

371
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:50,500
Yeah. She met him
at your party.

372
00:21:50,534 --> 00:21:51,867
Let me get this straight.

373
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:54,367
The guy who is Masuka's tool
all day long

374
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,101
is gonna be sexing up your sister?

375
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:57,867
When you get ahold of Dexter, find me.

376
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,433
For the Knights of Columbus
Demolition Derby...

377
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:01,234
[Cell phone ringing]

378
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:02,934
Make sure you stop by
and give doc a big hello.

379
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:04,500
[Cell stops ringing]

380
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:07,567
Debra, Debra, Debra.

381
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,400
Is she really worth it, Dexter?

382
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:13,600
What is it with you and her?

383
00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:16,467
I feel like I ran over
a nail or something.

384
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,767
[Tire thwacking]
Let's pull over.

385
00:22:19,801 --> 00:22:22,101
We need to find a base camp anyway.

386
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,834
This looks good.

387
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,268
[Car alarm chirps]

388
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,901
And if I can just get
your signature right there.

389
00:22:56,934 --> 00:23:00,400
Keep that pen if you want.

390
00:23:00,433 --> 00:23:02,234
That'll be $39.

391
00:23:02,268 --> 00:23:06,534
Please and thank you.

392
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:09,101
I saw from your plates
that you're from Florida.

393
00:23:09,134 --> 00:23:11,168
Must be happy to get out of there.

394
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:15,134
From what I see on the news,
that Miami is a real sewer.

395
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:17,268
And now, whatever the hell
is going on down there...

396
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,867
- Horses running in the streets.
- Mmm.

397
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:22,801
People say the world is ending.
Crazy assholes.

398
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:26,700
So what brings you to these parts?

399
00:23:26,734 --> 00:23:30,367
I'm following the Oregon trail.

400
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,934
Well, so partial
to the great outdoors,

401
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:34,101
what is it you do back in Florida?

402
00:23:34,134 --> 00:23:36,001
Landscaping.

403
00:23:36,034 --> 00:23:37,767
Never made any sense to me.

404
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:41,734
Just hiring someone to do
what nature does naturally.

405
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:44,201
This place would turn anyone
into a homicidal maniac.

406
00:23:44,234 --> 00:23:45,867
Can you point me
to the nearest garage?

407
00:23:45,901 --> 00:23:48,467
I have a flat.
I can patch that for you.

408
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,834
You can do that?

409
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:51,667
Yeah.
We're pretty handy here.

410
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,967
Unlike us city people.

411
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:55,901
Can you patch a tire?

412
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:59,067
No, I cannot.

413
00:23:59,101 --> 00:24:00,834
Well, I'm happy to help.
I'll give you a good deal too.

414
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:03,034
- How 'bout 20 bucks?
- Sign me up.

415
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,467
It's a deal.

416
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,667
Not a callous on that hand, is there?

417
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,433
I wear gloves when I work.

418
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:16,534
About how long do you think?

419
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:18,634
It shouldn't take me more
than a while.

420
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,734
Town's not too far
if you want to grab a bite.

421
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:22,400
Just follow the road.
It'll take you directly there.

422
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:24,700
I'm starving.

423
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:27,700
You're welcome.

424
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:41,433
Shortcut?

425
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:43,067
Lead the way.

426
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:09,201
It's a little pot farm.

427
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:12,834
Now I see why shady norm
wanted us to stay on the road.

428
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:15,234
Shady Norm's been a very industrious

429
00:25:15,268 --> 00:25:17,700
little fella, hasn't he?

430
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:19,268
Come on, let's get out of here.

431
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,567
Let's get lunch.

432
00:25:41,534 --> 00:25:43,567
When the Whore of Babylon is revealed,

433
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
she is "sitting on
a scarlet-colored beast"

434
00:25:45,634 --> 00:25:47,001
having seven heads."

435
00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:48,400
There were some pictures of this beast

436
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:49,634
in Gellar's sketch book.

437
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,500
I blew them up a little.
Looks like a dragon.

438
00:25:51,534 --> 00:25:53,101
Yeah, on paper.

439
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,867
Who knows how they'll bring it
to life in the next tableau?

440
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:57,767
Listen to this.
"The whore,

441
00:25:57,801 --> 00:26:00,834
"in addition to being arrayed
in purple and scarlet,

442
00:26:00,867 --> 00:26:03,134
will be drunk with the blood
of the saints."

443
00:26:03,168 --> 00:26:04,767
That's why they had holly
drink the blood.

444
00:26:04,801 --> 00:26:06,433
Drunk on the blood of the saints?

445
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:08,034
Were they making her
drink their blood?

446
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,767
If they consider themselves
saints, the creepy fucks.

447
00:26:11,801 --> 00:26:13,867
And why'd the younger guy
let her go? Who is he?

448
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:15,634
Probably a former student, right?

449
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,433
I mean, he kept referring
to Gellar as "Professor."

450
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:19,367
How do we get an ID on him?

451
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,734
Well, Gellar taught
at Tallahassee for 12 years.

452
00:26:21,767 --> 00:26:24,500
400 students per year, 4,800 names.

453
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:26,534
2,400 if you exclude females.

454
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:28,400
So if they're gonna continue,

455
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:30,467
the best way for us to stop
the next murder from happening

456
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,201
is to get a name
on Gellar's accomplice

457
00:26:32,234 --> 00:26:35,500
in a haystack of 2,400
potential suspects?

458
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:37,567
Fuck just isn't enough right now.

459
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,667
2,400 is not that big a number.

460
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,734
Unless you're talking virgins.

461
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,567
Maybe I could be of some help.

462
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,001
I'll work on it.

463
00:26:46,034 --> 00:26:47,734
I would kill myself, but it would add

464
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:49,534
to my murder total for the month.

465
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,867
At least we're closer to catching him

466
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,034
than we were this morning.

467
00:26:52,067 --> 00:26:54,867
Yeah, I feel a lot better.

468
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:58,834
Where the fuck is Dexter?

469
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:04,067
I promise I won't tell anyone.

470
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:07,367
Well, how do I know I can trust you?

471
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,433
Oh, well, that kiss
is a contract, you know.

472
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:12,934
Come on.

473
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:15,067
Okay, this is rough.

474
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:18,367
And it's not even
a beta version, but...

475
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,801
[Mild gasp]
you totally got my brother.

476
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:25,001
Even down to the way that hat
sits on his big head.

477
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:26,433
Is he, like, the star of your game?

478
00:27:26,467 --> 00:27:28,034
Well, the game is modeled
on the department,

479
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:31,767
so if he's the lead on a case,
then he's kind of the star.

480
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:32,834
- Yeah.
- You're really smart.

481
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:36,433
I know.
[Car door shuts]

482
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:39,567
Someone's here.

483
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,034
- Debra?
- Hi. Where's Dexter?

484
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:43,534
On a trip.

485
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:46,867
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

486
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:48,268
The keys?

487
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,367
His boat is still docked
at the marina.

488
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,634
Well, maybe he took his car.

489
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:53,767
Have you tried calling him?

490
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:56,767
About a thousand times.

491
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,268
But not from here.

492
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:03,067
If you could go somewhere
else, where would it be?

493
00:28:03,101 --> 00:28:04,934
I've never been to Portland.

494
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:06,901
That's a little predictable, isn't it?

495
00:28:06,934 --> 00:28:08,168
Isn't that where all
serial killers go?

496
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:10,734
[Cell phone rings]

497
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:12,934
Home, sweet home.
Don't answer that, Dexter.

498
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:15,600
Jamie? What's wrong?

499
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:19,967
- Where in fucktopia are you?
- Deb. Hi.

500
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:23,234
Did you get my messages?
What's that sound?

501
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,400
I can barely hear you.
The reception's terrible.

502
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:27,400
We had a breakthrough on the DDK case.

503
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:30,634
- Deb, I gotta go.
- You know...

504
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,300
You could have asked me
before you just took off.

505
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:36,734
You offered me some time off.

506
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:38,901
I meant the afternoon,
not five fucking days

507
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:41,534
to go wherever it is that you are!

508
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:43,034
Where are you?

509
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:46,767
It's-- I don't know...

510
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:49,333
personal.
I'm your sister.

511
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:52,534
Then tell my lieutenant that
I'll be back as soon as I can.

512
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:55,467
I'm sorry, you're breaking up.

513
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,934
We don't have much time.
We gotta do Jonah's now.

514
00:28:57,967 --> 00:28:59,801
Let's go.

515
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:02,134
Goody.

516
00:29:33,534 --> 00:29:36,867
There it is, 1965 Walnut Street.

517
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:40,433
Home of the family formerly
known as the Mitchells.

518
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:48,500
You want to kill him here
or just lie in wait?

519
00:29:48,534 --> 00:29:52,300
[Sighs] Neither.

520
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,201
Then what are we doing here?

521
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:57,168
I don't know for sure
that he's guilty.

522
00:29:57,201 --> 00:29:58,433
Not this again.

523
00:29:58,467 --> 00:30:00,433
Harry's code.

524
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:04,433
Tell me why it matters
if a person is good or bad.

525
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:07,034
Does it make you feel better
to kill bad people?

526
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:08,234
It's part of the ritual.

527
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:10,500
You don't need
a justification to kill.

528
00:30:10,534 --> 00:30:12,134
The code is more than that.

529
00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:14,433
It's kept me from getting caught.

530
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:16,168
It's given me a life.

531
00:30:16,201 --> 00:30:18,934
A life that is a big fat lie.

532
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:22,168
Just like Jonah's story.

533
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:25,500
What more proof do you need
that Jonah's guilty?

534
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:34,767
The FBI didn't photograph
the entire living room.

535
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:38,300
Maybe Jonah made a rookie mistake.

536
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,700
My knives!

537
00:30:41,734 --> 00:30:45,067
I'm guessing it's the motel gimp.

538
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:47,801
Whoever it is also took
my forensic kit.

539
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:49,934
Now, that I don't miss so much.

540
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:08,001
It's the midwest.

541
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,867
Nobody locks their doors.

542
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:33,168
There's no blood <i>anywhere.</i>

543
00:31:33,201 --> 00:31:36,500
[Sniffs]

544
00:31:36,534 --> 00:31:38,734
Bleach.

545
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:40,667
He cleaned up.

546
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:47,967
Rebecca died in the bathtub upstairs.

547
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:53,101
I'm bored.

548
00:31:53,134 --> 00:31:55,333
Why aren't we setting up a kill room?

549
00:31:57,367 --> 00:31:59,333
This is where Jonah
would have had to stand

550
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:02,901
to make it look like his father
beat his mother to death.

551
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:06,367
Try it.
Take a pretend swing.

552
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:21,834
Not the best clean-up job
I've ever seen.

553
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:24,168
Now for the living room.

554
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:27,734
This is the kitchen.

555
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:30,567
I'm making a test for bleach,
which I wouldn't have to do

556
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,700
if my forensic kit hadn't been stolen.

557
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:46,234
Get the fuck out of my house.

558
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,400
Show me where it happened, Jonah.

559
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:53,700
Your father killed your mother
here, on this staircase?

560
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:55,333
Police can be here in three minutes.

561
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:58,734
Here is where her body was,
and here...

562
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:00,433
is where you cleaned up
your mother's blood.

563
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:02,467
You're a sick fuck, you know that?

564
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,534
Where'd you fight your father
off-- It was here, right,

565
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,834
when you took the weapon
from him and hit him,

566
00:33:06,867 --> 00:33:09,001
chasing him off?
Yeah.

567
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:10,567
Swinging at him the whole time.

568
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,867
Yeah, I was. Yeah.

569
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:13,667
If that were true,
there'd be blood here

570
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,001
on the wall,
and then the ceiling here.

571
00:33:16,034 --> 00:33:17,101
But there's no spatter here.

572
00:33:17,134 --> 00:33:19,201
That's because
I cleaned it up. Now go!

573
00:33:19,234 --> 00:33:22,600
- With bleach?
- Yes.

574
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,734
Not on this wall.

575
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:26,268
Because there was no blood
on this wall,

576
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,467
because your father was never here.

577
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,034
I know for a fact that Trinity

578
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:34,433
did not kill anyone in this house.

579
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:44,567
Was that because you killed him?

580
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:50,734
Yes.

581
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:54,001
Just like you killed
your mother and your sister.

582
00:33:59,134 --> 00:34:00,101
Get him.

583
00:34:00,134 --> 00:34:02,067
[Car starts]

584
00:34:05,534 --> 00:34:07,467
[Tires screech]

585
00:34:17,801 --> 00:34:19,634
Satisfied?

586
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:21,767
Let's go set up the kill room.

587
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:24,001
That's my baby brother.
[Engine turns]

588
00:34:24,034 --> 00:34:25,967
What about your knives, Dexter?

589
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:28,367
You're gonna need them.

590
00:34:46,234 --> 00:34:48,767
Psst.

591
00:34:50,467 --> 00:34:53,300
He's in the shed.

592
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:04,201
Hey, there.

593
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:07,534
You're real interesting,
Florida, you know that?

594
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:10,333
All these potions and solutions

595
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:12,001
in this kit I found in your car.

596
00:35:12,034 --> 00:35:14,967
And these knives of yours.

597
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:17,901
They ain't exactly
landscaping tools now, are they?

598
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:21,667
I'd like them back.

599
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,867
I know you saw what I was
growing out there

600
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:25,134
in that cornfield.

601
00:35:25,168 --> 00:35:26,367
You know what's going on.

602
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,333
- I don't care about that.
- Really?

603
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:30,967
Then what are you doing here?

604
00:35:31,001 --> 00:35:33,234
You obviously have
some sort of desk job.

605
00:35:33,268 --> 00:35:34,600
Those hands of yours are so smooth.

606
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:38,567
You with the DEA, ATF, FBI?

607
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,201
Why don't you put
the knife down and we can talk.

608
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:41,700
What are they worth to you?

609
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:46,367
I can see you have some money
by that fancy car of yours.

610
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,667
It's a rental.

611
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,101
This is not how I was hoping
our first kill would be.

612
00:35:50,134 --> 00:35:52,168
I should think knives
like those of yours

613
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:57,067
would be worth $10,000 to you.

614
00:35:57,101 --> 00:35:59,001
This guy is leaving you no choice.

615
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:01,034
He's gonna kill you
if you don't kill him first.

616
00:36:01,067 --> 00:36:03,534
So I pay you $10,000,
you forget you ever saw me?

617
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:05,001
You can have your knives back.

618
00:36:05,034 --> 00:36:08,700
I'll go find an ATM,
but I'm taking these with me.

619
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:11,467
I found this in the car too.

620
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,801
$10,000.

621
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:16,234
Please and thank you.

622
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:18,433
Or you're a dead man.

623
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,467
At last... A kill!

624
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,967
No lengthy vetting process,
no stalking.

625
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:51,834
One can argue
self-defense, maybe.

626
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:54,001
A little too much talking
for my taste.

627
00:36:54,034 --> 00:36:55,634
Did you see his eyes?

628
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:58,600
Yes.

629
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:00,467
Why do you wake up your victims

630
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,734
when they're on the table?

631
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:04,734
I want them to know what they've done.

632
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:06,901
Bullshit!

633
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:10,268
You like to watch the light
go out of their eyes.

634
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,168
Doesn't make a bit of difference
if they're guilty or not.

635
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:20,300
How do you feel?

636
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:23,834
Like anything is possible.

637
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,834
This is the life
I've always wanted for you.

638
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:29,067
[Exhales]

639
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:32,067
Where do we go from here?

640
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:33,500
Jonah.

641
00:37:33,534 --> 00:37:36,300
And then what, Dexter?

642
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:40,901
And then...

643
00:37:40,934 --> 00:37:42,433
we keep going.

644
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:47,367
But first things first.

645
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,268
How do you dispose of a body

646
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,634
when you're miles from the ocean?

647
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:54,567
Norm's a thief,
a pot-grower, and an asshole--

648
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,700
Any one of which would
explain his death.

649
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:59,534
You can just leave his body
out in the open.

650
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:05,433
I have a better idea.

651
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:07,367
[Hinges squeaks]

652
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:18,400
I hope you took a souvenir.

653
00:39:08,168 --> 00:39:14,201
It's nice to see you, Travis.
I thought you were done with me.

654
00:39:14,234 --> 00:39:15,534
These are your things.

655
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:20,934
I wanted them out of my apartment.

656
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:22,534
Would have been a little bit easier

657
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:26,801
if you'd just dumped 'em
in the trash, wouldn't it?

658
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:30,234
I thought bringing them here
would give me closure.

659
00:39:33,268 --> 00:39:35,534
Closure.

660
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:37,500
Sounds like you went
from reading the Bible

661
00:39:37,534 --> 00:39:38,934
to reading
the self-help books.

662
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:41,367
But if you really came here because

663
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,234
you secretly wanted me to beg,

664
00:39:43,268 --> 00:39:47,967
well, then, please, Travis,
come back to me.

665
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:49,801
I didn't come here to have you beg.

666
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:52,600
How 'bout a story, then?

667
00:39:52,634 --> 00:39:54,300
I read one the other day in the paper

668
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:57,067
about a little girl
in California who was abducted.

669
00:39:57,101 --> 00:39:59,333
They went into her room,
and they grabbed her

670
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:01,567
while she was asleep
next to her teddy bear.

671
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,101
They raped her
and then they killed her,

672
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,600
and then they dumped her
into the woods.

673
00:40:04,634 --> 00:40:06,400
- Don't tell me--
- There was another story

674
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:10,168
about someone who set off a bomb
in Pennsylvania.

675
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:15,367
11 people were killed, 20 maimed.

676
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,834
That's why the world,
as it is, has to end.

677
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:21,168
Stop talking.

678
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:24,034
The sins of humankind continue

679
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:25,967
unless we put a stop to it.

680
00:40:26,001 --> 00:40:27,967
No, no, shut up.
Just shut up!

681
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:30,934
Are you gonna kill me?

682
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:33,700
Is that what you want to do, Travis?

683
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:42,967
What I want...

684
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:45,500
is to be free.

685
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:55,467
I'll talk to God.

686
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,300
I release you.

687
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,967
I can go?

688
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,467
You know where the door is.

689
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,534
[Recording]
You have no messages.

690
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:24,901
You're looming.

691
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:33,001
I, uh, came to apologize.

692
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:36,333
I apologize for being
an asshole at your party.

693
00:41:36,367 --> 00:41:40,268
And for sleeping
with that Professor chick.

694
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:45,168
And I apologize for proposing to you.

695
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:48,667
I just thought it was something
people did after a while,

696
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,700
you know?

697
00:41:50,734 --> 00:41:54,534
Like buying a coffee table.

698
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:56,734
We never bought a coffee table.

699
00:41:56,767 --> 00:41:58,001
Well, we talked about it.

700
00:41:58,034 --> 00:42:00,901
And we couldn't talk
about getting married?

701
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:03,867
We did have something good, right?

702
00:42:03,901 --> 00:42:07,001
I mean, I'm not crazy, am I?

703
00:42:07,034 --> 00:42:09,268
Yeah.

704
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:13,801
We had something good.

705
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,500
You know, there's times
when I come home,

706
00:42:18,534 --> 00:42:20,867
and I still expect to see you there.

707
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:24,700
And--and I open up the door,

708
00:42:24,734 --> 00:42:26,901
and everything's so neat and clean.

00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:27,901
[Laughs]

710
00:42:27,934 --> 00:42:30,268
And it hits me all over again.

711
00:42:32,168 --> 00:42:33,567
You're gone.

712
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:42,300
- I'm right here.
- Yeah.

713
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:44,400
In Laguerta's office.

714
00:42:44,433 --> 00:42:46,600
Fuck, I know, right?

715
00:42:46,634 --> 00:42:48,367
It still feels like her office.

716
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,467
I think that's why
I haven't unpacked anything.

717
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,101
At all.

718
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:53,667
Yeah.

719
00:42:56,901 --> 00:43:00,834
I wanted to tell you first
about this before anyone.

720
00:43:00,867 --> 00:43:03,101
I made that difficult.

721
00:43:03,134 --> 00:43:06,234
Yeah, but...

722
00:43:06,268 --> 00:43:08,400
you were hurt.

723
00:43:08,433 --> 00:43:11,467
Because of me.

724
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,101
And for that I am truly sorry.

725
00:43:15,967 --> 00:43:17,967
I really miss you, Deb.

726
00:43:20,168 --> 00:43:23,700
You, like, kept me glued or something.

727
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,600
Sometimes I don't know what I'm doing.

728
00:43:25,634 --> 00:43:27,634
I feel like the last day
my life made any sense

729
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:29,767
was the last day I spent with you.

730
00:43:49,234 --> 00:43:51,034
We can't.

731
00:43:57,467 --> 00:43:59,901
We're over, aren't we?

732
00:43:59,934 --> 00:44:02,600
Like <i>over</i> over.

733
00:44:24,268 --> 00:44:28,234
This is what our life together
could have been like

734
00:44:28,268 --> 00:44:29,801
if you hadn't killed me.

735
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:33,567
[Cell phone rings]

736
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,300
- Here's the call.
- Jonah.

737
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:37,567
Hello?

738
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,134
Dexter, can we talk about this?

739
00:44:40,168 --> 00:44:41,500
Sure, Jonah.

740
00:44:41,534 --> 00:44:43,967
Maybe somewhere private.

741
00:44:44,001 --> 00:44:45,467
I was thinking the shop's closed...

742
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,700
I'll meet you there.

743
00:44:46,734 --> 00:44:49,600
Jonah doesn't want to chitchat.

744
00:44:49,634 --> 00:44:51,001
I know.

745
00:44:51,034 --> 00:44:53,034
He has every reason
to want to kill me.

746
00:44:53,067 --> 00:44:54,667
I'm the one person
who knows what he did.

747
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:59,967
Don't you just love it
when things fall into place?

748
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:32,001
[[Door shuts]

749
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,667
You shouldn't have come to Nebraska.

750
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,268
I had to.
I couldn't believe it.

751
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,967
Believe what,
that I turned into a killer

752
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:43,101
like my father?

753
00:45:43,134 --> 00:45:45,734
Yes.
I thought I set you free.

754
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:47,567
Set your whole family free.

755
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,934
I wanted to kill him myself.

756
00:45:50,967 --> 00:45:53,834
But you'll settle for killing
your mom and your sister?

757
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:55,801
Yeah, and you.

758
00:46:00,268 --> 00:46:02,034
Do it, Dexter! Do it!

759
00:46:03,834 --> 00:46:07,934
Kill me!

760
00:46:07,967 --> 00:46:09,300
What did you say?

761
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,801
Please.

762
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:14,367
You want me to kill you?

763
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,734
What are you waiting for?

764
00:46:15,767 --> 00:46:17,834
Kill me for what I did.

765
00:46:23,067 --> 00:46:24,467
Tell me what happened.

766
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,734
Who cares what happened?

767
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:29,234
I didn't kill Rebecca.

768
00:46:29,268 --> 00:46:31,234
She killed herself.

769
00:46:31,268 --> 00:46:35,067
I found her like that
in the tub, my baby sister.

770
00:46:35,101 --> 00:46:38,801
God, I should have gotten her
out of that house sooner.

771
00:46:38,834 --> 00:46:40,201
She couldn't take it anymore.

772
00:46:40,234 --> 00:46:43,067
- Take what?
- Dexter...

773
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:45,400
My mom.

774
00:46:45,433 --> 00:46:50,400
How she blamed us
for everything he did.

775
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:52,534
She just--
She was still in love with him.

776
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:54,034
She kept defending him.

777
00:46:54,067 --> 00:46:57,834
She just wished he would come
and whisk her away

778
00:46:57,867 --> 00:47:00,700
to Thailand or Mexico.

779
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:04,101
Then I found Becca.

780
00:47:04,134 --> 00:47:06,700
And I just exploded on mom.

781
00:47:06,734 --> 00:47:11,634
I kept hitting her
over and over, just like dad!

782
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:13,600
I'm my father's son!

783
00:47:13,634 --> 00:47:16,034
Time to put him down, Dexter.

784
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:25,834
You brought me here
to provoke a fight,

785
00:47:25,867 --> 00:47:27,333
hoping I would kill you.

786
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:30,967
Death by Dexter.
Fantastic idea!

787
00:47:31,001 --> 00:47:32,034
Kill him!

788
00:47:37,433 --> 00:47:39,001
What if this were my son?

789
00:47:39,034 --> 00:47:41,134
We have come so far.

790
00:47:41,168 --> 00:47:42,500
He's not a monster.

791
00:47:42,534 --> 00:47:44,667
Don't you want to see
the light in his eyes go out?

792
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,567
No.

793
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,268
- Think how good it will feel.
- He has a conscience...

794
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,801
and regret.

795
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:57,433
This is the wishy-washy part
of you I can't stand.

796
00:47:57,467 --> 00:48:00,467
Uh, oh, Biney's mad.

797
00:48:03,801 --> 00:48:05,801
This is like Debra all over again.

798
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:07,834
You're weak.

799
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,901
I'm stronger than you.

800
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,867
We had a plan, Dexter.

801
00:48:17,901 --> 00:48:19,134
Just you and me.

802
00:48:19,168 --> 00:48:21,534
I'm going home.

803
00:48:28,134 --> 00:48:30,001
Baby brother.

804
00:48:30,034 --> 00:48:31,801
Wait!

805
00:48:31,834 --> 00:48:34,767
How am I supposed to live with this?

806
00:48:37,867 --> 00:48:39,834
Forgive yourself.

807
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:51,500
Have you been a good girl,
Debra Morgan?

808
00:48:51,534 --> 00:48:53,634
Because it's about to be Christmas.

809
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:55,400
Show her, Louis.

810
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,834
I created a program
that cross-referenced

811
00:48:57,867 --> 00:48:59,734
former students of Gellar
with people living

812
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:01,234
in a 20-mile radius of Miami.

813
00:49:01,268 --> 00:49:03,801
- I excluded a few variables...
- And presto!

814
00:49:03,834 --> 00:49:05,634
- 200 names.
- It was that easy?

815
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:08,500
- But not all that legal.
- Eh, not a problemo.

816
00:49:08,534 --> 00:49:11,001
Louis Greene is not
an employee of Miami Metro,

817
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:13,867
just an unpaid intern.

818
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:15,867
Thank you...

819
00:49:15,901 --> 00:49:17,500
I think.

820
00:49:17,534 --> 00:49:20,333
Here to serve.

821
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:30,367
If you want a ride to work,
I'm leaving in seven minutes.

822
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,901
- Not six?
- Not eight.

823
00:49:34,367 --> 00:49:36,234
I'll be ready.

824
00:49:57,201 --> 00:50:01,634
Brother Sam believed
light can keep darkness at bay.

825
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:04,934
But I wonder if darkness
is defined by light.

826
00:50:04,967 --> 00:50:08,700
If so, darkness can't exist
on its own.

827
00:50:10,634 --> 00:50:15,801
There must, by definition,
be light somewhere,

828
00:50:15,834 --> 00:50:18,001
waiting to be found.

829
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:29,667
Welcome home, son.
