00:01:47,294 --> 00:01:49,737
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:51,890
People think it's fun
to pretend you're a monster.

4
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:54,893
Me, I spend my life
pretending I'm not.

5
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:58,130
What made me the way I am
left a hollow place inside.

6
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:01,634
So I've become an expert
at blending in...

7
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:03,803
camouflaging myself.

8
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:05,538
They make it look so easy,

9
00:02:05,572 --> 00:02:08,341
connecting with
another human being.

10
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:10,010
I love you.

11
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:11,445
But if I could
have feelings at all,

12
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,080
I'd have them for Deb.

13
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:15,049
Why is it that we never
talk brother-sister stuff?

14
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:18,418
To be a brother,
to have a friend...

15
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:20,587
I only have one person
I can trust anymore.

16
00:02:20,622 --> 00:02:23,323
- You.
- To have a family...

17
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:25,258
- Rita's pregnant.
- That's so great!

18
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:28,828
If you play a role
long enough, really commit,

19
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:31,597
does it ever become real?

20
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:33,999
Any time you
let someone get close,

21
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:37,002
- it ends badly.
- I will fuck you back!

22
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:39,705
- Harry was right.
- Agh!

23
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,307
I've never felt this.

24
00:02:41,342 --> 00:02:42,809
You've never had a son before.

25
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:44,611
You wanna see him come
into the world.

26
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:47,514
Yes. I've never wanted
anything so much in my life.

27
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:50,518
Sure, I'm still
who I was, who I am.

28
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:52,787
Question is, who do I become?

29
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:55,823
Camouflage is nature's
craftiest trick.

30
00:02:55,857 --> 00:02:58,793
Arthur's terrorized them
into maintaining his cover,

31
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:00,894
they're nothing
but human shields.

32
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:02,863
That's what happens to
people who live with a monster.

33
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:04,231
I'm nothing like him!

34
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:06,467
My family is nothing like that.

35
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:09,270
I have to be the one
to kill him.

36
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:10,938
I have a family too, Arthur.

37
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:16,477
I thought
I could change what I am,

38
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:18,346
keep my family safe.

39
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,581
But it doesn't matter
what I do.

40
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:23,618
I'm what's wrong.

41
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,854
So what's your plan here?

42
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:29,824
I can't get revenge
for Rita's death.

43
00:03:29,858 --> 00:03:32,860
But I can help lumen
avenge what was done to her.

44
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:41,169
In her eyes...
I'm not a monster at all.

45
00:03:41,203 --> 00:03:43,138
I don't feel it anymore.

46
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:44,472
I'm so sorry.

47
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:46,608
Don't be sorry,
your darkness is gone.

48
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:50,178
I'll carry it for you.
Always.

49
00:03:50,212 --> 00:03:52,780
She made me think,
for the briefest moment,

50
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,149
that I might even
have a chance to be human.

51
00:03:56,518 --> 00:03:59,520
But wishes, of course,
are for children.

52
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:12,933
There are times in our lives

53
00:04:12,968 --> 00:04:15,336
when everything seems
to go wrong.

54
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:17,739
When, despite our best efforts,

55
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:19,674
and for no apparent
rhyme or reason,

56
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,944
tragedy strikes.

57
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,679
9-1-1,
what's your emergency?

58
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:28,050
- I've been stabbed.
- I understand, sir.

59
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:29,919
Can you tell me your location?

60
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:34,056
- Please, I need help.
- Team 42, we have

61
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,958
a possible stabbing
in the warehouse district,

62
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:38,460
please stand by
for approximate address.

63
00:04:56,578 --> 00:04:57,778
And there are other times

64
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:01,315
when everything goes...
just perfectly.

65
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,353
That's how the last year
has been for me.

66
00:05:10,194 --> 00:05:12,663
Hello, Ben.

67
00:05:12,697 --> 00:05:14,832
Roger.

68
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:17,702
You know it's wrong
what you've been doing.

69
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:19,670
What's going on?

70
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:23,908
How do you know our names?

71
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:25,409
Helping some of
your patients live,

72
00:05:25,443 --> 00:05:28,412
and letting others die.

73
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:30,814
Making them die...

74
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:33,817
so you could harvest
their body parts.

75
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:36,353
The police arrested
the emergency room doctor

76
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:40,458
who was selling them,
and that closed the case.

77
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:44,929
But I knew they must've had
a regular supplier.

78
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:48,032
So I did my research,
and here you are.

79
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:52,805
- We were just trying to--
- No!

80
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,342
You were just trying to
help yourselves make some money.

81
00:06:00,047 --> 00:06:01,981
That's all...

82
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:18,698
I've learned
that periods of darkness

83
00:06:18,732 --> 00:06:23,302
can overcome us at any time.

84
00:06:23,336 --> 00:06:27,039
But I've also found
that I'm able to endure.

85
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:29,508
Overcome.

86
00:06:29,543 --> 00:06:33,512
And in the process,
growing stronger...

87
00:06:33,547 --> 00:06:35,581
Smarter...

88
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:40,119
Better.

89
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:43,322
All is well in
my little corner of the world.

90
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:21,428
- Dexter!
- Hey, Jamie.

91
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:23,396
It's not what you're thinking.

92
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:24,765
Hey, Dex.

93
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:26,533
It's really not
what you're thinking.

94
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:28,168
Angel kept an eye on Harrison

95
00:07:28,203 --> 00:07:30,237
while I took
a really quick swim.

96
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:32,139
Thank you.

97
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:34,408
This was a great idea.

98
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:36,744
Buying the apartment
next to yours?

99
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:38,312
Because now you can slip

100
00:07:38,347 --> 00:07:39,780
in and out of your place,
day or night,

101
00:07:39,815 --> 00:07:40,881
without anyone knowing.

102
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,282
I never
really thought about that,

103
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:44,651
we just needed the extra space.

104
00:07:44,686 --> 00:07:46,386
How's my sister
working out for you?

105
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,887
Great.
Harrison loves her.

106
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:50,823
- And I love him.
- He get to sleep okay?

107
00:07:50,857 --> 00:07:52,291
Oh, yeah.
He's sleeping like...

108
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:54,259
You know, a baby.

109
00:07:54,294 --> 00:07:55,728
Except he's not a baby anymore.

110
00:07:55,762 --> 00:07:57,763
He's got his first pre-school
interview in the morning.

111
00:07:57,798 --> 00:07:59,665
They grow up fast.

112
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,100
Good luck tomorrow.

113
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:02,902
- Thanks.
- I guess we should be leaving.

114
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:04,938
Yeah.
Unless you need me to stay.

115
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:06,072
I'm gonna be up
studying all night,

116
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:07,608
so I can do that here
just as easily.

117
00:08:07,642 --> 00:08:08,976
No, no.
You should go, I'm good.

118
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,445
- Okay.
- But I will need you

119
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,847
to stay late tomorrow night.

120
00:08:12,882 --> 00:08:15,917
Your high school reunion--
already on my calendar.

121
00:08:15,952 --> 00:08:18,286
- Thanks.
- Bye.

122
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,656
- But leave the shirt on.
- Angel.

123
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:33,335
Hey, buddy.

124
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:37,773
Big day for you tomorrow.

125
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:40,809
We're all moving forward.

126
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:47,983
At Our Lady of the Gulf,

127
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:50,018
we like to create enough
structure for our children

128
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:51,453
so that they feel safe,

129
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:54,523
and enough freedom
so that they feel challenged.

130
00:08:54,557 --> 00:08:55,924
Okay.

131
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,425
Attendance in our pre-school

132
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,894
guarantees your child admission
to our secondary school,

133
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:03,297
which as I'm sure you know is
a highly esteemed feeder school

134
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:06,134
to some of the finest Ivy League
universities in the country.

135
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:09,036
- Harvard, here we come.
- And as I'm sure you know,

136
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,504
we have a very rigorous
admission process.

137
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:14,741
Not everyone that applies
to Our Lady of the Gulf gets in.

138
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:17,610
Mr. Morgan, you
were referred to us by...?

139
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:20,480
- Angel Batista.
- Sergeant Batista,

140
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:22,282
at the police station,
where we work.

141
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:26,921
We...being the people
that protect you

142
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:29,190
in case something bad happens.

143
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:31,259
Sergeant Batista's
daughter went here,

144
00:09:31,293 --> 00:09:32,694
and he recommended the school.

145
00:09:32,728 --> 00:09:34,029
I remember Angel.

146
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:36,431
His daughter
did very well here.

147
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:41,170
So you are catholic as
well, Mr. Morgan?

148
00:09:41,204 --> 00:09:43,772
Actually, I'm not.

149
00:09:43,807 --> 00:09:45,674
And though it does
have a certain appeal,

150
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:48,177
I'm not sure
it's right for everyone.

151
00:09:49,913 --> 00:09:52,848
- So...protestant?
- No.

152
00:09:52,882 --> 00:09:54,249
- Jewish?
- No.

153
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:57,252
- Muslim?
- Nope.

154
00:09:57,286 --> 00:10:00,121
Any religious affiliation?

155
00:10:00,155 --> 00:10:02,490
No.

156
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:06,027
What do you
believe in, Mr. Morgan?

157
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:08,530
Nothing.
I don't...

158
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:11,566
believe in anything.

159
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:17,071
Oh.

160
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:19,173
Harrison really
seemed to like it in there.

161
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,475
He didn't wanna leave.

162
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:22,444
I think he
just liked the cookies.

163
00:10:22,478 --> 00:10:24,379
And he already made
some friends.

164
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:28,851
Mm.

165
00:10:28,885 --> 00:10:31,988
You're not really sold on
this place, are you?

166
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:33,089
Not completely.

167
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:34,257
Is it because
of the religious thing?

168
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:35,925
- Partly.
- What you said in there,

169
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,395
do you really believe that?
You really believe in nothing?

170
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,766
Yeah, I suppose I believe
in a certain set of principles.

171
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,434
What kind of principles?

172
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:47,770
A set of rules on how
to conduct myself in the world

173
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:50,507
so that I don't get...
into trouble.

174
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,845
I'm not the most
religious person in the world--

175
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:58,981
I mean, mom practically
had to drag me to church--

176
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:01,483
- but seriously?
- What?

177
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:04,619
A set of rules to follow
so you don't get in trouble?

178
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:06,321
Sounds like something
I might teach a puppy.

179
00:11:06,355 --> 00:11:07,655
Is that so bad?

180
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,691
Just sounds
kinda cold and empty.

181
00:11:13,094 --> 00:11:14,094
Does it?

182
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:16,664
Yeah.

183
00:11:16,698 --> 00:11:19,000
I don't know, you can believe
whatever you wanna believe.

184
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:21,069
Or not believe
whatever you wanna believe.

185
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:25,073
But it's not
just about you anymore.

186
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:26,909
You're a father.
What about Harrison?

187
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:29,378
You have to think about
what you want him to believe.

188
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:32,414
Right.

189
00:11:44,694 --> 00:11:46,361
Anyway, I'll see you
back at the station

190
00:11:46,395 --> 00:11:48,296
for Laguerta's
little costume party.

191
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:52,234
Okay.

192
00:11:52,268 --> 00:11:54,169
To be honest,
I've given a lot of thought

193
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:56,337
to what I don't
wanna pass onto Harrison--

194
00:11:56,372 --> 00:11:58,006
namely my Dark Passenger--

195
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,043
but very little about
what I do want to pass on.

196
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:06,248
Good afternoon to my colleagues

197
00:12:06,283 --> 00:12:11,253
at Miami Metro Homicide,
family, friends,

198
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:14,056
ladies and
gentlemen of the press.

199
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,658
Today we join in
witnessing the promotion

200
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:20,662
of one of Miami Metro's finest,
Maria Laguerta.

201
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:23,631
- The fuck have you been?
- I had to run some errands.

202
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,532
- What errands?
- When she joined our ranks,

203
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:28,869
she was appointed to the
department 12 years ago in June.

204
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:30,770
Why do you smell like old lady?

205
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:32,706
I was at the mall.
They sprayed me with cologne.

206
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,974
The mall?
The only thing you smell like

207
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:36,876
when you leave the mall
is a corn dog.

208
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,245
It was too early
for a corn dog.

209
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,382
Shh.

210
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,585
Not always an easy task
for a uniform.

211
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:49,691
They're looking
awfully lovey-dovey up there.

212
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:51,860
- You think the two of them are...
- Gross, no way.

213
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:53,629
Matthews and Laguerta
hate each other.

214
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:55,465
Oh, yeah, just like you and
Quinn used to hate each other?

215
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:57,033
And now you two have
been living together for--

216
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:00,737
I'm proud to also
consider my.

217
00:13:00,771 --> 00:13:04,508
See what I mean?

218
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:07,411
They do seem
a little too friendly.

219
00:13:07,446 --> 00:13:11,082
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you captain Laguerta.

220
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:16,288
One more person moving forward.

221
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:27,166
Thank you, thank you.

222
00:13:41,514 --> 00:13:44,682
- Captain Laguerta.
- Deputy chief.

223
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:48,885
That was a beautiful speech.

224
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,021
I was touched.
It was almost as if--

225
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:52,756
Almost as if
you'd written it yourself?

226
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,258
Yeah.

227
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,128
Well, I couldn't
leave anything to chance.

228
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:00,197
But you were very convinc--

229
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:03,333
Okay, cut the crap, Marie,
give me the book.

230
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:05,869
You know, you're lucky
I'm the one who found it.

231
00:14:05,903 --> 00:14:08,539
Anybody else would've
thrown you to the wolves.

232
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:11,141
Could you
imagine the headlines?

233
00:14:11,176 --> 00:14:14,545
"Deputy Chief Matthews
featured prominently

234
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:17,581
in Miami Madame's
little black book."

235
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:20,284
Please, don't talk
about integrity to me.

236
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,252
You divorced
that husband of yours

237
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:24,221
as soon as you realized
he was no career asset.

238
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,722
That is not true.

239
00:14:25,756 --> 00:14:29,558
- And you know that--
- Save it.

240
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:32,561
I'm not interested.

241
00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:38,133
Watch your step, Maria.

242
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:41,136
You're playing
with the big boys now.

243
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:48,811
All right,
keep it tight, everybody.

244
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:49,879
Come on, come on, come on.

245
00:14:49,913 --> 00:14:51,881
Stay with me, everyone.
Stay with me.

246
00:14:51,915 --> 00:14:53,517
Take a very
reverent look around,

247
00:14:53,551 --> 00:14:57,054
this is the home
of Miami Metro Homicide.

248
00:14:57,088 --> 00:15:00,992
And this is the heart of
it all, my lab.

249
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,494
Who are you,
and why are you in my way?

250
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:06,531
Tom Peter, I'm one of
Professor Masuka's students.

251
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:08,467
- Professor Masuka?
- I'm teaching

252
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:10,235
both the extension
and online classes

253
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,738
in Forensic Pathology
at the university.

254
00:15:12,773 --> 00:15:16,342
Class, this is detective
Morgan and detective Quinn.

255
00:15:16,376 --> 00:15:18,978
And that...
i sergeant Batista.

256
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:22,448
And this is the future
of forensic science.

257
00:15:22,482 --> 00:15:24,517
Well...

258
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:27,520
The future looks very bright.

259
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,694
All right, let's go, let's go.

260
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:35,195
Right this way, right this way.

261
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,298
Next stop is my lab,
and then the spatter room,

262
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:40,301
and then what's always
the last stop, the morgue.

263
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:45,640
Maybe I should teach a class.

264
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:47,475
Yeah, on how to rob a cradle.

265
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,545
Hey, I'm twice divorced,
leave me alone.

266
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,113
Who are all those people?

267
00:15:52,148 --> 00:15:54,749
The future of boring.

268
00:15:54,784 --> 00:15:57,485
- Oh.
- Nice jacket.

269
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,021
You getting all duded up
for the big high school reunion?

270
00:16:00,055 --> 00:16:03,357
- 20 years.
- Speaking of schools...

271
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:05,426
Have you heard from
Harrison's pre-school yet?

272
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,361
- Mm, not yet.
- Tick tock, Dex.

273
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:08,796
Okay, okay.

274
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:11,031
I can't believe
you're going to your reunion.

275
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:12,299
You're, like, the only person

276
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:13,901
that hated high school
more than me.

277
00:16:13,936 --> 00:16:15,570
Eh, it'll be good to catch up

278
00:16:15,604 --> 00:16:19,307
with some of the old friends.

279
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:23,011
You're hoping to get laid.

280
00:16:23,045 --> 00:16:26,048
You got me.

281
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:31,520
Janet Walker.

282
00:16:31,554 --> 00:16:34,523
But I knew her as
Janet McKellen.

283
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,331
I didn't exactly
have friends in high school,

284
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:46,935
but she was always nice to me.

285
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,436
She and Joe Walker were voted

286
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:51,305
"Most Beautiful Couple"
our senior year.

287
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,609
Unlike Janet,
Joe hardly knew I existed.

288
00:16:55,644 --> 00:16:57,512
Joe was captain of
the school football team.

289
00:16:57,546 --> 00:16:59,547
A real bruiser on the field.

290
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:03,450
But I remember him for
the bruises he left on Janet.

291
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:05,586
They got married
straight out of high school

292
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:08,589
and moved to Virginia.

293
00:17:08,623 --> 00:17:09,990
I'd almost forgotten about her

294
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:13,427
until I noticed her obituary
in the alumni newsletter.

295
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:16,830
She was found dead three
years ago, an apparent suicide.

296
00:17:16,864 --> 00:17:20,333
But there was blood
underneath her fingernails.

297
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:22,034
How could it get there

298
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,736
if her fingers were
wrapped around the grip,

299
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,638
pointing away from her body?

300
00:17:25,672 --> 00:17:27,239
It must belong to someone else.

301
00:17:27,274 --> 00:17:30,275
Perhaps someone she scratched
while putting up a fight.

302
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:40,619
Perhaps someone who
will be at the reunion tonight.

303
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:20,359
Take us closer to the edge,
they like shallow water.

304
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:28,135
You know,
Florida water snakes...

305
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,773
don't lay eggs.

306
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,910
They give birth to live young.

307
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:37,479
Around 20 or 30,

308
00:18:37,513 --> 00:18:40,481
sometimes even more.

309
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:46,086
There.

310
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,588
And she's pregnant.

311
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:51,624
Makes her fat and slow.

312
00:19:02,335 --> 00:19:05,304
Well done.

313
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,644
There's a lot of them inside.

314
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,680
All we're gonna need is seven.

315
00:19:25,725 --> 00:19:28,559
High school--
a small world unto itself,

316
00:19:28,594 --> 00:19:31,562
combining all the warmest
elements of a federal work camp

317
00:19:31,597 --> 00:19:33,697
with those of
a third-world poultry farm.

318
00:19:33,732 --> 00:19:36,733
It's a miracle I graduated
without killing anyone.

319
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:51,249
I was invisible in high school.

320
00:19:51,284 --> 00:19:54,286
Just a shadow
passing through the hallway.

321
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:59,592
- Dexter!
- Alan.

322
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:02,661
Best biology lab partners
ever, right dude?

323
00:20:02,696 --> 00:20:06,132
- Oh, you bet, dude.
- Man, I never saw anyone

324
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,067
dissect a fetal pig
as fast as you.

325
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:10,837
You're, like, the first student
ever to ask for seconds.

326
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:12,672
That was
a great learning experience.

327
00:20:12,706 --> 00:20:14,273
Obviously.

328
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:17,444
Now you're some
hot shot blood spatter guy.

329
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:19,846
- It's awesome!
- Thanks.

330
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:22,116
Hey, we should check out
all these activities

331
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:27,422
- they've got planned for us.
- Yeah, you go on ahead.

332
00:20:27,457 --> 00:20:30,425
I'm only here for one activity.

333
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:34,197
Hey, there he is.

334
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:35,498
And there he is.

335
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:37,667
Oh!

336
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:40,669
Still the center of attention.

337
00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:43,539
I'm finally gonna get
some use out of my class ring.

338
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:45,941
I sharpened part of it so that
I could prick Joe's hand

339
00:20:45,975 --> 00:20:50,745
when we shake and
draw a small drop of blood.

340
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,648
- Dexter!
- Mindy.

341
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:55,383
Hey, my date
to the spring formal.

342
00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:57,918
- Which was held right here.
- What a night that was.

343
00:20:57,953 --> 00:21:00,721
Hey, I'm so sorry
to hear about your wife.

344
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:03,056
Oh, thanks.

345
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:05,726
Yeah, that was
a horrible thing, but...

346
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,995
- You know.
- Right, of course.

347
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:09,963
What about you?
Did you ever get married?

348
00:21:09,998 --> 00:21:13,200
I did.
Honey...

349
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:16,037
- This is my wife, Heather.
- Oh.

350
00:21:16,071 --> 00:21:19,141
Um, you're the last man
that I ever dated.

351
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:20,576
Huh.

352
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,678
Well, I'm glad
if I was of any help.

353
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:24,714
Dexter, hey,
Mr. Blood Spatter guy.

354
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:26,750
I read about you in the paper.
Lookin' good.

355
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:28,919
- Thanks.
- Dexter?

356
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:33,925
- Uh...Trisha.
- You look fantastic.

357
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,760
I can't wait to
sit down and catch up.

358
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,195
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Right now?

359
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,432
Uh, there's some people
I need to say hello to first.

360
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,567
- Hey, Joe.
- Oh, hey, good to see you.

361
00:21:44,602 --> 00:21:46,669
Dexter Morgan.
Wow!

362
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:48,737
Looks like someone's
been working out.

363
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:54,042
Yeah, doing my best.

364
00:21:54,077 --> 00:21:57,112
Dexter!
So sorry about your wife.

365
00:21:57,146 --> 00:21:59,348
- We read all about it.
- Yeah.

366
00:21:59,382 --> 00:22:04,287
Oh.
Thank you.

367
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:07,858
You've had a personal tragedy.

368
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:09,026
Unlike everyone else,

369
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,762
you look better
than you did 20 years ago,

370
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,765
and you've got a cool job.

371
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,535
Put all those things together,
and it makes you...

372
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,571
- Popular.
- How's it feel?

373
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,776
- I hate it.
- Come on, it's great.

374
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,444
Most of the people here
would love to be popular.

375
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,812
Most of the people
here don't have

376
00:22:29,847 --> 00:22:32,481
two rolls of duct tape,
80 yards of plastic sheeting,

377
00:22:32,515 --> 00:22:34,450
and a surgical saw
in their truck.

378
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:36,385
It's not the end of
the world, Dex.

379
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,721
No, but it definitely
makes things more difficult.

380
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:40,456
I'm used
to flying under the radar.

381
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:43,326
So you're
flying a little higher.

382
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,629
That's a good thing.

383
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:47,665
So what am I supposed to do?

384
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,668
Enjoy it, son.

385
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,747
? ?

386
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,283
Being a blood spatter
analyst really isn't

387
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,518
so much of a job as
it's a calling.

388
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:11,354
You guys are
the modern American cowboys.

389
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:14,624
Yes.

390
00:23:14,658 --> 00:23:19,696
Yee-haw!

391
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,598
Ah, I'm gonna go grab a refill.

392
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:25,635
All right.

393
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:35,113
Joe.
Hey.

394
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,183
Dexter.
What's going on, man?

395
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:41,953
Nice, a sample of my own blood.

396
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:45,190
- You know, life.
- I know, man.

397
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,860
I know.

398
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:49,628
Looks like you've
done pretty well for yourself

399
00:23:49,663 --> 00:23:51,598
over the past 20 years.

400
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:53,734
I have.
I moved to Virginia,

401
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:56,603
bought a couple
sporting goods stores.

402
00:23:56,638 --> 00:23:58,405
- Oh.
- It's good business.

403
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,973
How about you?

404
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:02,075
I work for
Miami Metro Homicide.

405
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:05,512
- You're a cop?
- No, no, I'm a lab geek.

406
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:07,013
I work in
the forensics department.

407
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:09,048
Lab geek!
That's who you are!

408
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:11,684
Now I remember,
the science brainiac.

409
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:14,854
Yep, that would be me.

410
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:16,322
Ah.

411
00:24:16,356 --> 00:24:19,491
Hey, I was sorry to
hear about Janet.

412
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:21,593
Yeah.

413
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,494
That was tough.

414
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:26,430
But I understand you kinda
went through the same thing?

415
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,865
Yeah.
It's true,

416
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,968
we both lost our wives
way too early.

417
00:24:32,002 --> 00:24:34,503
- Sometimes life sucks.
- Mm.

418
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:36,005
What do you do?

419
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,406
You know,
it's been three years now,

420
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:41,111
and still sometimes
I get so angry with Janet

421
00:24:41,145 --> 00:24:43,280
doing what she did,
leaving me like that.

422
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:45,149
I know, it must be hard on you.

423
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:48,919
Mm.
Yeah.

424
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,989
Yeah.

425
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:54,326
Ooh, wow.

426
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,764
Get a look at that.
Trisha Billings.

427
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,900
Right, I spoke to her
a little while ago.

428
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:04,503
Yes, little Miss Prom Queen
still hot as ever.

429
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,373
You know, my one regret
in high school

430
00:25:08,408 --> 00:25:11,476
was that I never
tapped that sweet ass.

431
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,945
Well,
you were dating Janet then.

432
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,447
Right.

433
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,116
Of course.

434
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,251
But...

435
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,854
I should at least go say hello.

436
00:25:26,891 --> 00:25:29,292
? Can't touch this ?

437
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,062
I need to find another way
to get a drop of Joe's blood.

438
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,831
? Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh ?

439
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:36,933
? can't touch this ?
? oh, oh, oh, oh-oh ?

440
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,003
? my, my, my, my ?
? can't touch this ?

441
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,572
And I think I just found it.

442
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:45,377
Come on, Dexter.
It's hammer time.

443
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,279
- Ah.
- Whoo!

444
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:49,782
I have no idea
what "hammer time" is.

445
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:52,285
? And I'm known as such ?

446
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,821
Or how it differs from
regular time.

447
00:25:54,856 --> 00:25:57,257
? I told you homeboy,
you can't touch this ?

448
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,926
? yeah, that's how
we're livin' and you know ?

449
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:01,661
? you can't touch this ?

450
00:26:01,696 --> 00:26:03,496
? look in my eyes, man ?

451
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:05,231
? you can't touch this ?

452
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:07,467
? yo, let me
bust the funky lyrics ?

453
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:08,901
? you can't touch this ?

454
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:14,339
? oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh ?

455
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:16,642
? can't touch this ?
? oh-oh ?

456
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:27,454
Patience.

457
00:26:58,456 --> 00:27:01,557
"In the midst of the street
was the tree of life,

458
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:03,426
"which bears 12 manner of fruit

459
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,694
and yielded
her fruit every month."

460
00:27:05,728 --> 00:27:07,930
Do you want something?

461
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:10,866
I'd like some oranges, please.

462
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:13,869
Ah...

463
00:27:16,907 --> 00:27:22,912
? ?

464
00:27:33,722 --> 00:27:35,089
Seems small without your stuff.

465
00:27:35,124 --> 00:27:36,824
Had to make room for you.

466
00:27:36,858 --> 00:27:38,392
I'm acting lt. only.

467
00:27:38,426 --> 00:27:40,794
Not if I recommend you
for the position full-time.

468
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:42,129
You don't owe me anything,
you know that.

469
00:27:42,163 --> 00:27:45,466
- Yes, I know that.
- And that was the deal.

470
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:47,368
We divorce, things
go back to the way they were

471
00:27:47,402 --> 00:27:50,004
- while we were still friends.
- That's exactly what this is.

472
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:52,606
I'm choosing
you to run Homicide

473
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,575
because
you're the best there is.

474
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:57,344
- There's no other reason.
- You sure?

475
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:06,654
Honestly.

476
00:28:06,688 --> 00:28:09,523
Okay, my motives
are not unselfish.

477
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:12,292
I need someone in here
who I can trust,

478
00:28:12,327 --> 00:28:15,329
- someone who will have my back.
- I don't know.

479
00:28:15,364 --> 00:28:17,799
I'm someone who needs to
be on the streets.

480
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,368
The street can be exciting,
but it's also hard.

481
00:28:20,402 --> 00:28:23,438
And none of us
are getting any younger.

482
00:28:23,473 --> 00:28:27,309
You need to start
thinking about your future here.

483
00:28:27,343 --> 00:28:30,946
Besides, the prestige
and salary bump can't hurt.

484
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,647
I know what
you're saying, but--

485
00:28:32,682 --> 00:28:34,049
How much of a salary bump?

486
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,684
20% the first year.

487
00:28:35,718 --> 00:28:37,719
- Hmm.
- Think about it.

488
00:28:37,753 --> 00:28:40,455
Fine.
But no promises.

489
00:28:40,489 --> 00:28:43,491
Okay...
Lieutenant Batista.

490
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:55,168
Wishbone,
hail Mary, buttonhook...

491
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:56,803
Nothing is what it seems.

492
00:28:56,837 --> 00:28:59,640
If I have any hope of blending in
I need to learn this.

493
00:28:59,674 --> 00:29:01,942
Just enough so that
I can get close to Joe

494
00:29:01,976 --> 00:29:05,579
and draw a bit of blood.

495
00:29:05,614 --> 00:29:09,751
Even the coffin corner
isn't as fun as you'd think.

496
00:29:09,785 --> 00:29:12,788
We've got a situation.
Grab your kit.

497
00:29:24,168 --> 00:29:26,302
Ah-ah, pros only.

498
00:29:26,337 --> 00:29:28,071
Everybody stay behind
the yellow tape

499
00:29:28,105 --> 00:29:29,772
and watch me work my magic.

500
00:29:29,806 --> 00:29:31,641
Watch well, and one of you

501
00:29:31,676 --> 00:29:34,177
will be lucky enough to
become my intern.

502
00:29:34,212 --> 00:29:36,880
A prized opportunity...

503
00:29:36,914 --> 00:29:39,883
that will have to be earned.

504
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:41,684
Ten bucks
the hot chick earns it.

505
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:44,120
I can't take that bet.
It's too obvious.

506
00:29:44,155 --> 00:29:47,423
- So what do we got?
- About three pounds of meat.

507
00:29:47,457 --> 00:29:49,291
- Any body?
- Not yet.

508
00:29:49,326 --> 00:29:51,494
An early morning customer
called it in.

509
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,668
Ah, intestines.

510
00:29:58,702 --> 00:30:02,405
- We've covered that, Sherlock.
- They're human.

511
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,707
These tissue tears indicate

512
00:30:03,741 --> 00:30:05,676
they were removed
in a very crude manner.

513
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,212
Yeah, but where's the body?

514
00:30:08,246 --> 00:30:10,515
Where was the vic disemboweled?

515
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:12,384
This spatter suggests
the initial blow

516
00:30:12,418 --> 00:30:15,086
was to the head from behind.

517
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:17,422
Probably in
the process of unloading.

518
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:19,590
The victim went down...

519
00:30:19,624 --> 00:30:23,060
and he was dragged...

520
00:30:23,094 --> 00:30:25,228
down to here.

521
00:30:26,931 --> 00:30:32,168
Watch the blood.

522
00:30:32,202 --> 00:30:34,903
This spray
comes from a stab wound--

523
00:30:34,937 --> 00:30:36,371
That's likely what killed him.

524
00:30:36,405 --> 00:30:38,006
And this pool
of blood in the dirt

525
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,841
suggests he was
disemboweled here.

526
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:41,142
No signs of a struggle,

527
00:30:41,176 --> 00:30:43,444
judging from
the undisturbed blood pool.

528
00:30:43,478 --> 00:30:44,945
Yeah, he was either
dead or unconscious

529
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,780
when his intestines
were removed.

530
00:30:46,814 --> 00:30:48,615
No usable footprints
through the blood?

531
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:49,916
What do you
think we're up against?

532
00:30:49,951 --> 00:30:51,451
I mean, leaving
the intestines on the scale

533
00:30:51,485 --> 00:30:53,019
wasn't done by accident.

534
00:30:53,054 --> 00:30:54,888
Body part removal
could be drug-related,

535
00:30:54,923 --> 00:30:57,958
it could be Santeria, voodoo.

536
00:30:57,992 --> 00:30:59,393
Let's hold on a second folks.

537
00:30:59,427 --> 00:31:01,796
Could you guys set up a larger
perimeter, search the area?

538
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,265
The body might've
been dumped nearby.

539
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:08,302
Hey.
Uh, can we...talk in private?

540
00:31:08,336 --> 00:31:10,938
- Yeah, go ahead.
- No, I mean, like, later.

541
00:31:10,972 --> 00:31:13,007
- Over dinner.
- Why?

542
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:15,542
What's the big deal?

543
00:31:15,577 --> 00:31:17,344
That's why I'm asking you.
You're being weird.

544
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:18,545
You're being weird.

545
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,516
Okay, now you're
being weird and stupid.

546
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,484
Did you buy another
big-screen TV for the apartment?

547
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,553
If you bought another
big screen for the apartment

548
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:28,022
and you're expecting me
to pay for half of it,

549
00:31:28,056 --> 00:31:29,390
- there's no way--
- I didn't buy anything.

550
00:31:29,425 --> 00:31:33,629
- Jesus Christ, leave me alone.
- I'd return it.

551
00:31:33,663 --> 00:31:35,798
I got all I need.

552
00:31:35,832 --> 00:31:37,166
I'm gonna sneak back
to my reunion,

553
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,202
I got a big flag football game
to suit up for.

554
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:45,640
Did I just hear him right?

555
00:31:48,677 --> 00:31:49,777
You run the post corner.

556
00:31:49,811 --> 00:31:51,044
Everyone else
know what they're doing?

557
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:53,146
- Ready!
- Ready!

558
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:54,914
- Let's go.
- Yep, you got your man, right?

559
00:31:54,949 --> 00:31:57,417
This time, the plan is

560
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:58,751
when Joe is at
the bottom of the pile,

561
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:01,888
I'll give him a quick jab
and get my sample.

562
00:32:01,923 --> 00:32:02,989
18!

563
00:32:03,024 --> 00:32:04,357
5!

564
00:32:04,392 --> 00:32:07,394
Red, yellow, hike!

565
00:32:11,565 --> 00:32:14,433
Unfortunately,
Joe never seems to go down.

566
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:17,770
Block that shit!

567
00:32:17,804 --> 00:32:21,507
Unlike me.

568
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:22,742
Come on, Dexter!

569
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:25,145
Stay low, block high.

570
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:29,049
You gotta
block that shit, Morgan.

571
00:32:29,084 --> 00:32:32,086
My lancet.

572
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,888
No lancet
means no blood sample.

573
00:32:33,922 --> 00:32:35,623
Huddle up, bros.

574
00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:37,091
Let's go deep, baby.
Let's go deep.

575
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:43,797
So I want you
to break outside and go deep.

576
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:46,299
Look, Dexter,
you're an offensive lineman.

577
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:48,235
And it's your job to
stay close to the quarterback

578
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:49,903
and protect him from
the rushers.

579
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:51,405
And while you're there,
sticking close...

580
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:54,474
Give the little prick a hard
jab in the nose with your elbow.

581
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:57,510
Make him bleed, Dexter.

582
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:08,622
Blue 46, hike!

583
00:33:08,656 --> 00:33:10,090
Oh! Shit!

584
00:33:10,124 --> 00:33:11,725
- Sorry, Joe.
- What the fuck was that?

585
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:14,227
Sorry.
Sor--oh, whoa.

586
00:33:14,262 --> 00:33:16,496
Who taught you
how to play football?

587
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:17,963
My dad.

588
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:42,652
And we've got a blood match.

589
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,689
Tomorrow night,
Joe is all mine.

590
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:52,096
- Dexter.
- Night, Angel.

591
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:57,200
Did you take Harrison
for his pre-school interview?

592
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,369
Yeah, I did.

593
00:33:59,403 --> 00:34:01,871
Good, 'cause Auri
really liked it there.

594
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,340
She didn't find it scary?

595
00:34:04,374 --> 00:34:07,210
The statues,
and the...you know.

596
00:34:07,244 --> 00:34:08,611
The crucifix.

597
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:10,713
That's a very powerful image

598
00:34:10,747 --> 00:34:12,314
of the sacrifice
that was made for us.

599
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:14,349
All kids have
to learn those kind of things.

600
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:16,852
Those kinds of things.

601
00:34:16,886 --> 00:34:18,487
Sorry, but why?

602
00:34:18,521 --> 00:34:20,656
I only ask because
I wasn't brought up

603
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,025
with much church experience.

604
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:24,728
No, that's okay.
These are good questions.

605
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,465
Um...

606
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:29,033
It's the catechism.

607
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:34,439
And they need
to learn that because...?

608
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:39,811
God has put a desire
for himself in every person.

609
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:41,479
Look, I know
this is a little basic,

610
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:43,248
but how do we even know
there is a God?

611
00:34:44,784 --> 00:34:47,052
You know, so I
can explain it to Harrison.

612
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,655
Oh, well...

613
00:34:49,689 --> 00:34:53,058
Well, there is a God...

614
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:57,129
Because in...

615
00:34:57,163 --> 00:34:59,799
In every one of us,

616
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:04,336
there is a powerful
sense of moral goodness.

617
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:06,105
Okay.

618
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:08,941
But honestly,
when you really get down to it,

619
00:35:08,975 --> 00:35:12,378
- it's all about faith.
- Mm.

620
00:35:12,412 --> 00:35:14,279
It's something you feel,

621
00:35:14,314 --> 00:35:17,616
not something you can explain.

622
00:35:17,651 --> 00:35:20,753
This is very hard to
put into words.

623
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:23,756
Because it makes no sense.

624
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,259
Thanks, Angel, you really
made it all much more clear.

625
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:30,629
Sure.
Always happy to help.

626
00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:35,100
This place is
kind of fancy, isn't it?

627
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,901
It's okay, I'm buying.

628
00:35:36,936 --> 00:35:39,905
Oh, and I'm eating.

629
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:48,279
That was nice of Dexter
to let you out early tonight.

630
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:50,648
Oh, yeah,
he's such a good boss.

631
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:53,218
He works around
my school schedule,

632
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:55,653
- whatever I need.
- He's a good guy.

633
00:35:55,688 --> 00:35:57,355
- Mm-hmm.
- With all he went through

634
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:59,691
last year,
you know, losing his wife...

635
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:01,593
I'm glad he's got you
helping him out.

636
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,861
Yeah, so sad.

637
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:06,430
Well, I think he's putting it
all behind him at least.

638
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:10,402
Well, I don't know.
Some nights...

639
00:36:10,436 --> 00:36:12,337
What?

640
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:16,008
It just seems like some
nights the pain, the loneliness,

641
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:18,477
whatever it is he's feeling,
gets to be too much

642
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:20,880
and he's gotta
just disappear for a while,

643
00:36:20,914 --> 00:36:22,815
go out on his boat.

644
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,850
I think he's trying
to keep it away from Harrison.

645
00:36:24,885 --> 00:36:27,586
Yeah.
He really loves his son.

646
00:36:27,621 --> 00:36:29,188
Poor guy needs
a hobby or something.

647
00:36:29,222 --> 00:36:31,023
Totally.
Thank you.

648
00:36:31,057 --> 00:36:34,726
Thanks. Can I get a nice
bottle of champagne, please?

649
00:36:34,761 --> 00:36:36,328
Thanks.

650
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:39,565
Champagne?
What is up with you?

651
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,768
We're celebrating.

652
00:36:41,802 --> 00:36:44,404
You're looking at
the next lieutenant of Homicide.

653
00:36:44,438 --> 00:36:45,839
- You?
- Yeah.

654
00:36:45,874 --> 00:36:48,475
Angel!
That is so fantastic!

655
00:36:48,509 --> 00:36:50,010
Wait, when did this happen?

656
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:52,146
It's not official yet.
I'm only acting lt.

657
00:36:52,181 --> 00:36:54,683
But you know, it should
come through any day now.

658
00:36:54,717 --> 00:36:56,518
I am so happy for you.

659
00:36:56,552 --> 00:36:57,752
It comes
with a nice salary bump.

660
00:36:57,787 --> 00:37:00,188
We can finally get out
of that little apartment

661
00:37:00,222 --> 00:37:02,824
- and into a nice house.
- Wouldn't that be so great.

662
00:37:02,858 --> 00:37:05,126
I could put Auri
back in ballet lessons.

663
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,861
How's she doing?

664
00:37:06,896 --> 00:37:09,464
- You know, a teenager.
- Oh.

665
00:37:09,498 --> 00:37:11,666
She doesn't
need her daddy anymore.

666
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,535
It's a phase, I'm sure.

667
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,671
I'm sure.

668
00:37:16,705 --> 00:37:19,674
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

669
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,346
- Oh, wow.
- What?

670
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,248
It's...yep.

671
00:37:26,282 --> 00:37:30,553
Um, you're kinda almost
naked on top there.

672
00:37:30,587 --> 00:37:34,157
- It's...
- You sound just like pop.

673
00:37:34,191 --> 00:37:35,892
Don't say that.

674
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:37,961
It's true.
He used to follow me

675
00:37:37,995 --> 00:37:40,096
when I walked to school to make
sure I didn't talk to any boys.

676
00:37:40,131 --> 00:37:41,631
I just don't want
people thinking

677
00:37:41,665 --> 00:37:43,166
that you're my girlfriend.

678
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,334
Why would they think that?

679
00:37:44,368 --> 00:37:45,936
Because you
just took off your top.

680
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:48,539
- You're all sexualized.
- Oh, my God!

681
00:37:48,573 --> 00:37:50,374
You're serious!

682
00:37:50,408 --> 00:37:52,008
I know
we didn't grow up together,

683
00:37:52,043 --> 00:37:55,679
- but I'm your sister, Angel.
- I know, I know.

684
00:37:55,713 --> 00:37:58,181
She's--she's not my girlfriend.

685
00:37:58,215 --> 00:38:02,819
What?

686
00:38:02,854 --> 00:38:04,988
I just told her
that you're not my girlfriend.

687
00:38:05,023 --> 00:38:07,124
She probably
thinks you're a prostitute.

688
00:38:07,158 --> 00:38:10,327
Oh, my God.
I was wrong.

689
00:38:10,361 --> 00:38:12,930
You're not like pop,
you are pop.

690
00:38:12,964 --> 00:38:15,733
I should beat you for that.

691
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:19,003
Exactly like pop.

692
00:38:35,253 --> 00:38:37,854
- Sister?
- Mr. Morgan.

693
00:38:37,889 --> 00:38:39,923
- Good morning.
- Hi.

694
00:38:39,957 --> 00:38:42,926
I just wanted to apologize
for the other day.

695
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,095
I didn't mean to
come across as indifferent.

696
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:48,331
Of course not.

697
00:38:48,365 --> 00:38:53,435
The fact is, I'm pretty
ignorant in spiritual matters.

698
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:56,971
I had a rather
unconventional childhood.

699
00:38:57,006 --> 00:38:59,307
- Oh?
- My father taught me

700
00:38:59,342 --> 00:39:01,410
what he thought was important.

701
00:39:01,444 --> 00:39:06,315
But I guess we had some concerns
that seemed more pressing

702
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,819
- than learning about God.
- I see.

703
00:39:09,854 --> 00:39:12,222
But I want Harrison
to have a normal childhood,

704
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:14,491
a good childhood.

705
00:39:14,526 --> 00:39:17,528
I would like
for him to go here.

706
00:39:17,562 --> 00:39:19,763
And you came all the way
out here this morning

707
00:39:19,798 --> 00:39:22,333
just to tell me this?

708
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:25,369
It seemed important.

709
00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:31,909
I'll see if we can find
a place for your son.

710
00:39:31,943 --> 00:39:35,646
Thank you.

711
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:41,385
Ah!

712
00:39:55,003 --> 00:39:56,437
Hey.

713
00:39:56,471 --> 00:39:59,039
I've got my intern
photographing the scene.

714
00:39:59,073 --> 00:40:01,108
That's your intern?

715
00:40:01,142 --> 00:40:02,609
What happened
to the little hottie?

716
00:40:02,644 --> 00:40:03,844
What are you suggesting?

717
00:40:03,878 --> 00:40:05,479
That I would pick Ryan
as my intern

718
00:40:05,513 --> 00:40:09,116
simply because of her
remarkable breasts and buttocks?

719
00:40:09,151 --> 00:40:10,818
- Yeah.
- I find that incredibly

720
00:40:10,852 --> 00:40:12,953
insulting that you would
question my integrity.

721
00:40:12,987 --> 00:40:15,021
I picked the student
with the highest test scores,

722
00:40:15,056 --> 00:40:17,090
- end of story.
- So what do we got here?

723
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:20,694
Floater, washed ashore.
Some lady called it in.

724
00:40:27,202 --> 00:40:31,138
- He's dead.
- That's your best guy?

725
00:40:31,173 --> 00:40:33,007
Looks like he was
killed by the stab wound,

726
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,175
he wasn't drowned.

727
00:40:34,209 --> 00:40:36,277
His body was put
in the water post-mortem.

728
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:39,447
So he was dumped.
Someone tried to hide the body?

729
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:40,615
Vince?

730
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:42,650
He wasn't in the water
very long.

731
00:40:42,684 --> 00:40:43,951
Three, four hours, max.

732
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:45,719
So he was dumped
right off-shore.

733
00:40:45,754 --> 00:40:47,955
Doesn't look like somebody
was trying to hide him.

734
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:49,990
No, more like they wanted
the body to be found.

735
00:40:50,025 --> 00:40:53,460
Last thing I need is
a complicated crime scene.

736
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:55,462
Holy shit.

737
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:58,064
Someone cut him open,
then sewed him back up.

738
00:40:58,099 --> 00:40:59,733
And it just got complicated.

739
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:01,968
These incisions
were made post-mortem.

740
00:41:02,003 --> 00:41:05,005
Our fruit vendor?

741
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:12,212
- Omar Rivera.
- That's our guy.

742
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:16,616
These stitchings are
really weird.

743
00:41:16,651 --> 00:41:20,788
There's, like, an "A" and
then a horseshoe kind of thing.

744
00:41:20,822 --> 00:41:23,123
It's Greek.
Alpha, Omega.

745
00:41:23,157 --> 00:41:24,491
How do you know Greek?

746
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:27,027
I dated some sorority chicks
back in the day.

747
00:41:27,061 --> 00:41:30,030
Of course you did.

748
00:41:32,066 --> 00:41:33,634
Holy shit, it's moving.

749
00:41:33,668 --> 00:41:35,136
There's something inside.

750
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,782
Holy Frankenfuck!
Snakes!

751
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:55,224
Bag 'em, bag 'em.

752
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:06,802
Ugh!

753
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:12,476
- Got 'em all?
- Yeah.

754
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,645
- How many you got?
- Uh, seven.

755
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,681
Seven snakes.

756
00:42:20,485 --> 00:42:23,020
Your guy just fainted.

757
00:42:23,054 --> 00:42:25,656
That's not a good sign
for a crime scene investigator.

758
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:27,390
Good-bye, big guy.

759
00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:29,926
Hello, runner-up,
little miss hottie.

760
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,594
Can we get back to this,
please?

761
00:42:31,629 --> 00:42:33,529
Snakes.
I mean, what the fuck?

762
00:42:33,564 --> 00:42:34,897
How does that happen?

763
00:42:34,932 --> 00:42:37,267
I mean, what?
Did snakes crawl inside of him?

764
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:39,670
No, they're freshwater snakes.
Somebody put them there.

765
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:42,306
Somebody cut him open,
took out his intestines,

766
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,075
and replaced them with snakes.

767
00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:48,846
- Why?
- To send a message, maybe?

768
00:42:48,881 --> 00:42:51,416
Dude, what kind
of message does it send

769
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:53,052
putting snakes
in a dead guy's stomach?

770
00:42:53,086 --> 00:42:56,322
Some kind of warning, maybe.

771
00:42:56,356 --> 00:42:59,158
Whatever the message,
whoever sent it

772
00:42:59,192 --> 00:43:01,393
went to
a lot of time and trouble.

773
00:43:01,428 --> 00:43:04,429
This is no amateur.

774
00:43:15,707 --> 00:43:17,341
After Joe's
had a couple of drinks,

775
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,510
I'll figure out a way
to get him to step outside

776
00:43:19,544 --> 00:43:22,146
- where I'll M99 him and--
- Dexter!

777
00:43:22,181 --> 00:43:24,749
Trisha.

778
00:43:24,783 --> 00:43:26,451
- Hi.
- Hi-yee.

779
00:43:26,485 --> 00:43:29,154
I was hoping I'd see you
before the weekend was over.

780
00:43:29,188 --> 00:43:31,657
Oh, well, here I am.

781
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,060
Mm-hmm.

782
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:37,464
- Shall we?
- If it wasn't for you,

783
00:43:37,498 --> 00:43:39,933
I'd have never
made it through high school.

784
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:44,670
Oh?

785
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,640
You saved my life.

786
00:43:47,674 --> 00:43:50,409
I saved your--
How?

787
00:43:50,444 --> 00:43:52,111
We had
so many classes together,

788
00:43:52,145 --> 00:43:54,113
and I'd always
sit right behind you.

789
00:43:54,147 --> 00:43:56,749
Every test we took,
I'd copy all your answers.

790
00:43:56,784 --> 00:44:00,186
- It's how I got through.
- Oh, well, I never noticed.

791
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:03,990
That's okay.
That makes us even.

792
00:44:04,025 --> 00:44:06,159
I never noticed
how cute you are.

793
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:09,463
Until now.

794
00:44:09,497 --> 00:44:13,767
- Oh.
- Oh, my God, Mr. Smith's class.

795
00:44:13,802 --> 00:44:16,571
- This is it.
- Wow.

796
00:44:16,605 --> 00:44:20,107
You helped me a lot
in this classroom.

797
00:44:27,883 --> 00:44:30,919
Maybe I should give
you a little something back.

798
00:44:33,022 --> 00:44:35,057
Trisha,
I don't have time for this.

799
00:44:35,091 --> 00:44:38,093
Yes, you do.

800
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,869
This is--

801
00:44:46,903 --> 00:44:48,738
Really...

802
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:52,642
Stop talking, Dexter.

803
00:44:52,677 --> 00:44:54,344
Oh.

804
00:45:10,662 --> 00:45:13,864
Oh, God, what
did I get myself into?

805
00:45:13,898 --> 00:45:16,300
This is never good.

806
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:18,602
That was so good.

807
00:45:18,636 --> 00:45:21,605
Thanks, sweetie.

808
00:45:32,484 --> 00:45:35,619
Your purse.

809
00:45:35,654 --> 00:45:38,622
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

810
00:45:38,656 --> 00:45:41,658
Whoa, that was easy.

811
00:45:51,534 --> 00:45:52,634
? ?

812
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:58,606
? ?

813
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,610
Ooh, Trisha, you bad girl.

814
00:46:29,273 --> 00:46:31,875
What is this?

815
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:35,212
Trisha?

816
00:46:35,247 --> 00:46:37,114
You here?

817
00:46:37,149 --> 00:46:39,249
What the fuck?

818
00:46:39,284 --> 00:46:42,152
Fast reflexes.
I hate jocks.

819
00:46:42,187 --> 00:46:45,155
- It's you.
- I'm a mighty Panther.

820
00:46:49,127 --> 00:46:51,327
I'm the gold and red.

821
00:46:51,362 --> 00:46:53,963
Jesus, you still are
some weird loser.

822
00:46:53,997 --> 00:46:55,164
What the fuck's up with you?

823
00:46:55,198 --> 00:46:57,332
Tonight is meant for victory,

824
00:46:57,367 --> 00:46:59,535
it's time to make you dead.

825
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,671
Oh.

826
00:47:01,706 --> 00:47:03,373
I don't think
that last line is right.

827
00:47:03,408 --> 00:47:06,410
Oh, I'm pretty sure it is.

828
00:47:23,863 --> 00:47:25,965
Welcome back.

829
00:47:25,999 --> 00:47:27,967
What the hell is going on?

830
00:47:28,001 --> 00:47:31,636
Why'd you do it, Joe?

831
00:47:31,671 --> 00:47:33,305
Why'd you kill Janet?

832
00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:35,407
What?
Who said I killed Janet?

833
00:47:35,442 --> 00:47:36,842
I didn't kill Janet.
I was--

834
00:47:38,444 --> 00:47:39,745
No more lies.

835
00:47:43,516 --> 00:47:45,483
I'm a blood
spatter expert, remember?

836
00:47:45,518 --> 00:47:49,720
I see things others miss.

837
00:47:49,754 --> 00:47:52,622
You shot Janet,
then put the gun in her hand.

838
00:47:52,657 --> 00:47:55,024
No, I-I-I-I-I-I came home
and I found her--

839
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:58,094
Okay, o-o-okay, okay.

840
00:47:58,128 --> 00:47:59,529
But I had to.

841
00:47:59,563 --> 00:48:01,431
Yeah? Why?
Why'd you have to?

842
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:03,266
Because
we were having problems,

843
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,635
and-and
the marriage was over,

844
00:48:05,669 --> 00:48:08,938
- and-and...
- And so you killed her?

845
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:11,207
Do you know
how expensive a divorce is?

846
00:48:11,242 --> 00:48:12,810
Really?

847
00:48:12,844 --> 00:48:15,813
That's your answer?

848
00:48:22,854 --> 00:48:26,958
What would Jesus have done?

849
00:48:26,992 --> 00:48:31,662
Seriously now.

850
00:48:34,901 --> 00:48:36,067
How do you reconcile

851
00:48:36,102 --> 00:48:37,969
your belief in
a higher power--in a God--

852
00:48:38,003 --> 00:48:39,270
with what you've done?

853
00:48:39,304 --> 00:48:41,472
What difference does it make?

854
00:48:41,507 --> 00:48:42,974
I'm just curious.

855
00:48:43,008 --> 00:48:46,143
So what, I'm supposed
to defend my beliefs to you?

856
00:48:46,177 --> 00:48:48,645
If you don't mind.

857
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,749
Look, I mean,
everyone makes mistakes.

858
00:48:52,783 --> 00:48:56,118
And...They do things
that they shouldn't do.

859
00:48:56,152 --> 00:48:57,686
And they're only human.

860
00:48:57,721 --> 00:49:00,256
But God--
see, God forgives us.

861
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:01,925
Really, it's as simple as that?

862
00:49:01,959 --> 00:49:03,727
You kill someone,
God forgives you for it?

863
00:49:03,761 --> 00:49:05,028
- Yes.
- So I could kill you

864
00:49:05,063 --> 00:49:06,630
- and God would forgive me?
- Well, no.

865
00:49:06,665 --> 00:49:10,734
- You just said he would.
- You have to truly repent.

866
00:49:10,768 --> 00:49:13,270
Do you truly
repent for killing Janet?

867
00:49:13,304 --> 00:49:15,505
- Yes, definitely.
- Liar.

868
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:16,874
No, no,
you don't wanna do that!

869
00:49:16,908 --> 00:49:19,309
- Why is that?
- 'Cause...

870
00:49:19,344 --> 00:49:22,279
If you let me go, God
will give you life everlasting,

871
00:49:22,314 --> 00:49:24,481
and whatever you want.

872
00:49:24,515 --> 00:49:27,116
Eh, there's really
nothing I need.

873
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:29,318
You know, you don't wanna--

874
00:49:29,353 --> 00:49:31,987
you don't wanna--
you don't wanna make God mad.

875
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:33,755
Don't you hear
how foolish you sound?

876
00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:34,890
Because he will smite you

877
00:49:34,924 --> 00:49:37,964
with swords,
and rocks, and thunder.

878
00:49:38,084 --> 00:49:40,357
Ehhh,
thunder is just the noise.

879
00:49:40,492 --> 00:49:41,548
It would be lightning.

880
00:49:41,668 --> 00:49:43,836
You cannot kill me
for God is a mighty fortress.

881
00:49:43,956 --> 00:49:44,967
Joe, please, stop.

882
00:49:45,087 --> 00:49:46,780
And I have been washed
with the blood of the lamb,

883
00:49:46,814 --> 00:49:49,016
and he will protect me--

884
00:49:53,288 --> 00:49:56,290
Sorry.
Hammer time.

885
00:50:00,462 --> 00:50:02,896
So I talked to
the Coast Guard today,

886
00:50:02,931 --> 00:50:04,965
and they confirmed
what we'd already figured.

887
00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:07,167
With the tides and all that,
that body was probably

888
00:50:07,201 --> 00:50:11,705
tossed in the water no more
than a quarter mile off shore.

889
00:50:11,739 --> 00:50:12,872
Really?

890
00:50:12,906 --> 00:50:14,974
You don't seem very interested.

891
00:50:15,008 --> 00:50:16,709
No, of course I'm interested.

892
00:50:16,743 --> 00:50:19,344
I-I-I just, um...

893
00:50:19,379 --> 00:50:21,046
don't really
wanna talk about work.

894
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:23,349
What is going on with you?
You're acting so weird lately.

895
00:50:23,383 --> 00:50:24,684
I'm not acting weird, I--

896
00:50:24,718 --> 00:50:29,588
You're about
to drink the candle.

897
00:50:29,623 --> 00:50:32,625
I'm just gonna use
the restroom.

898
00:50:43,404 --> 00:50:46,107
Debra...

899
00:50:46,141 --> 00:50:49,511
Will you marry me?

900
00:50:49,545 --> 00:50:53,482
God, I sound
like a fucking idiot.

901
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:57,987
Thank you.

902
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:00,823
Get down, get down, get down!

903
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:12,168
Fuck!
He's wearing kevlar.

904
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,614
Don't fuckin' move!

905
00:51:25,648 --> 00:51:26,715
You all right?

906
00:51:26,749 --> 00:51:30,618
Yeah.

907
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:36,523
Life is good.

908
00:51:36,558 --> 00:51:38,392
I'm not at all unhappy.

909
00:51:38,426 --> 00:51:40,394
I'm quite content
to go about my life

910
00:51:40,428 --> 00:51:42,797
believing in nothing.

911
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:45,833
With no fear that there might be
something more out there.

912
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:52,408
"I stood upon
the sand of the sea,

913
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:56,013
"and I saw a serpent
rise up out of the sea,

914
00:51:56,047 --> 00:51:58,282
having seven heads."

915
00:51:58,316 --> 00:52:01,318
"And upon these heads,
the name of blasphemy."

916
00:52:04,757 --> 00:52:06,390
So it's begun?

917
00:52:06,425 --> 00:52:09,961
Yes.
It's begun.

918
00:52:16,368 --> 00:52:18,268
But I also have a son.

919
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,171
And I have to think about
what he wants

920
00:52:20,205 --> 00:52:21,940
and what's best for him,

921
00:52:21,974 --> 00:52:23,408
because who knows?

922
00:52:23,442 --> 00:52:24,842
Maybe he'll
grow up to be someone

923
00:52:24,877 --> 00:52:26,511
who wants to think about...

924
00:52:26,545 --> 00:52:29,010
those kinds of things.

925
00:52:31,508 --> 00:52:41,994
