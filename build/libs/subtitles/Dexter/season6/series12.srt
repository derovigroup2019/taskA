2
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,367
Previously on Dexter...

3
00:01:48,682 --> 00:01:49,988
What do you believe in,
Mr. Morgan?

4
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:51,017
Mm, nothing.

5
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:52,485
You can believe whatever
you wanna believe,

6
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,253
but it's not just about you anymore.

7
00:01:54,287 --> 00:01:56,768
That's why I'm making you
Homicide's new lieutenant.

8
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:58,562
Fuck balls.
You're serious.

9
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:00,102
There's something inside.

10
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:03,100
Holy Franken-fuck!
Snakes!

11
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:04,335
So it's begun.

12
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:07,104
Yes.

13
00:02:08,273 --> 00:02:09,874
No!

14
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:12,276
This Revelation expert, James Gellar.

15
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,212
Professor from the University
of Tallahassee.

16
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:17,548
Gellar disappeared three years
ago after he got fired.

17
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:22,085
Travis Marshall.

18
00:02:23,354 --> 00:02:24,988
I suppose it was God who told you

19
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:26,756
to kill all those innocent people.

20
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,526
God speaks to the professor.

21
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,528
You said Gellar does the killing.

22
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:34,397
He's so much stronger than me.

23
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:37,466
Gellar.
He's been dead all along.

24
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,068
Travis, you killed Gellar.

25
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,137
Miami Metro Homicide.

26
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:45,706
That's where God wants us
to stage Wormwood.

27
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:51,245
Dex, you saved a lot of lives today.

28
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:53,214
You saved my life.

29
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:55,449
Every time the shit
hits the fan, I go to him.

30
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:57,050
He's your safe place.

31
00:02:57,085 --> 00:02:58,585
You're making it sound like I want to

32
00:02:58,619 --> 00:03:00,821
be with him or something.

33
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:02,423
Well, do you?

34
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:04,058
This is a job of trust,

35
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:06,238
and I can't have
a partner I can't trust.

36
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,697
The beast is coming for you.

37
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:11,500
You didn't really think you could foil

38
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:13,814
God's plan, did you?

39
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:57,311
I guess it's fitting that I end up

40
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:59,315
where I've left so many others.

41
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:22,805
I only wonder if the world

42
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,841
will be a better place without me.

43
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:57,103
It's wrong,
what people say about dying.

44
00:04:57,137 --> 00:05:00,339
I'm not flashing back over my life...

45
00:05:00,373 --> 00:05:02,508
over the lives I've taken.

46
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:06,346
I'm thinking about the life I'll miss.

47
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,381
Harrison.

48
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:09,783
I'll miss watching my son grow up.

49
00:05:39,446 --> 00:05:43,049
Are you okay?

50
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,019
You are very lucky.

51
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:52,026
God is looking out for you.

52
00:06:14,284 --> 00:06:16,786
Where are we?

53
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,688
Florida...

54
00:06:18,722 --> 00:06:21,991
Five miles away.

55
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:26,529
We'll be there soon.

56
00:06:26,564 --> 00:06:28,498
Perhaps.

57
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:40,945
He's robbing us,

58
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,713
and I have nothing to give.

59
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:56,692
I can give him death.

60
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:10,306
You're safe.

61
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,913
We'll be there soon.

62
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:34,661
Florida!

63
00:08:05,828 --> 00:08:07,028
It's finished.

64
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:09,229
Those were Travis' last words to me,

65
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:10,230
and he's right.

66
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:13,066
There's no way to find him now.

67
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,634
I'm going home to my son.

68
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:19,038
Excuse me.

69
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:20,439
Do you have a phone I can use?

70
00:08:20,473 --> 00:08:21,573
Oh, sure.

71
00:08:21,608 --> 00:08:23,909
More on the ballgames later,
and now--

72
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:29,716
The solar eclipse is due
at 3:28 tomorrow afternoon.

73
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,718
It's a great opportunity
to trick your kids

74
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:33,720
into learning a little science.

75
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:35,755
Stick with us,
and Dr. Mehler will teach you

76
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,525
how to make a simple pinhole
camera that will allow you

77
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,627
to watch in safety with your children.

78
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:42,896
But first, this message.

79
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:48,068
Stare at the sun, you idiots.

80
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:51,471
Better you be blinded than
face the horrors that await you.

81
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,652
I can't stay here much longer

82
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:08,856
if you're gonna stink like that.

83
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:17,363
Daddy.

84
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:21,935
I cannot believe you fell off
your boat and swam to shore.

85
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:23,637
You must be exhausted.

86
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:26,940
Yeah.
Mostly, I feel dumb.

87
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:30,144
I'll be okay.

88
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:34,382
- Let's go home.
- Yeah.

89
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:43,659
I lost my keys, wallet, cell phone.

90
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:45,428
Yeah, of course.

91
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,883
Are you okay?

92
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:13,120
Yeah, just...

93
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,989
thirsty.
Hungry.

94
00:10:16,024 --> 00:10:18,158
I can't imagine if he
would have lost you, Dexter.

95
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:19,359
You're very lucky.

96
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:23,529
Yeah.

97
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:26,966
Lucky.

98
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:33,306
What can I do to help?

99
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,241
We're good until the morning.

100
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:36,709
Okay.

101
00:10:36,743 --> 00:10:37,977
Don't forget, his pageant's tomorrow.

102
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:41,047
I'll be there.

103
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,885
- Thank you.
- Sure.

104
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,051
If some God or some force

105
00:11:17,086 --> 00:11:21,890
did save me today,

106
00:11:21,924 --> 00:11:27,897
I'm sure it was for you
and not for me.

107
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,895
Today's the day.

108
00:12:49,814 --> 00:12:51,515
Dex!

109
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:59,224
I got a report that your boat
had washed ashore.

110
00:12:59,258 --> 00:13:01,292
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

111
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:03,228
Kept calling your cell phone,
there was no answer.

112
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:06,230
God, you can't keep doing this to me.

113
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:11,968
I've almost lost you twice.

114
00:13:13,338 --> 00:13:14,972
I love you.

115
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:19,243
I love you too.

116
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:20,977
You do?

117
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:25,081
Of course I do.

118
00:13:25,115 --> 00:13:30,120
I don't think
you've ever said it before.

119
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,968
It's a double murder.

120
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:49,472
There's blood.

121
00:13:49,506 --> 00:13:50,773
Will you write down
the address for me?

122
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:52,708
Are you sure you're up for it?

123
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:57,614
Yeah, I'm good.

124
00:14:14,932 --> 00:14:17,567
- You been inside yet?
- No.

125
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:20,437
We've been waiting on you.

126
00:14:52,836 --> 00:14:56,171
This was Travis.

127
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:59,441
He killed these people

128
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:04,279
because he needed a place to hide.

129
00:15:10,722 --> 00:15:12,356
Well, we'll take care--
we'll find out.

130
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,959
Yeah?

131
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:17,862
It's about fucking time.

132
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:20,665
I had to get gas.

133
00:15:23,702 --> 00:15:25,236
I'll never get used to that.

134
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,038
Ah, the sweet smell of
hydrogen sulfide,

135
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:28,973
carbon dioxide,
and methane all liquefying

136
00:15:29,007 --> 00:15:31,175
into a frothy treat.

137
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:34,845
Where's Dex?

138
00:15:43,054 --> 00:15:44,888
Fuck me.

139
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:48,192
Fuckin' Travis Marshall was here.

140
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:49,460
Looks like it.

141
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:51,864
What's the painting of?

142
00:15:51,898 --> 00:15:53,532
It's the beast being thrown
into the lake of fire.

143
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,535
It's the last tableau.

144
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:57,403
Why do you think
he smashed in the face?

145
00:15:57,437 --> 00:16:01,441
I can't imagine.

146
00:16:01,475 --> 00:16:03,843
Better go photograph the bodies.

147
00:16:03,877 --> 00:16:07,580
I'll take care of this room.

148
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:13,652
What do you think happened here?

149
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:14,887
I don't know.

150
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:20,559
Either way, it's a horrible way to go.

151
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:35,942
They were both killed
by blows to the head.

152
00:16:35,976 --> 00:16:38,978
Her, once.
Him, multiple times.

153
00:16:39,012 --> 00:16:40,113
Blunt instrument.

154
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:43,683
Most likely that frying pan.

155
00:16:43,717 --> 00:16:44,951
When?

156
00:16:44,985 --> 00:16:47,954
At least 48 hours ago.

157
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:53,693
You're looking at me weird.

158
00:16:53,728 --> 00:16:55,095
- Am I?
- Aren't you?

159
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:59,666
I'm just taking pictures, Deb.

160
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,304
Okay.

161
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:07,540
Let's just focus on work
right now, okay?

162
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:08,875
Okay.

163
00:17:13,114 --> 00:17:16,416
Where the fuck is Travis Marshall?

164
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,452
He could be anywhere.

165
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:20,820
You think he's done
the lake of fire yet?

166
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:22,756
I don't know.

167
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,057
He could just be hiding out somewhere.

168
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:25,826
He could just be kicking back
with a beer,

169
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,060
waiting for the eclipse.

170
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:30,063
That's very possible, Deb.

171
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:36,236
Okay.

172
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,440
I'm gonna go back to the office.

173
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,477
I gotta find a way
to catch this fucker.

174
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:43,879
I'll see you back there.

175
00:17:43,913 --> 00:17:46,881
Okay.
Sorry.

176
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:11,975
Despite what Travis said,
maybe it's not quite finished.

177
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,413
My one advantage is
that he thinks I'm dead.

178
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:38,868
Now where do I go?

179
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:43,874
Please, God.

180
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:46,276
I've done everything
you have asked of me.

181
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:18,810
Thank you.

182
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:27,652
You know, my last day
is coming up fast.

183
00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:30,322
A dark day indeed.

184
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:33,492
You will be missed.

185
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:41,368
I was wondering, um...

186
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:44,737
there's no way
I could stay on permanently?

187
00:19:44,772 --> 00:19:45,938
Maybe as an assistant?

188
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:47,773
What about your video games?

189
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:49,041
Yeah.

190
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:52,944
It just doesn't seem
important anymore.

191
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:58,416
Louis, Miami Metro Homicide
is an elite crew, okay?

192
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,152
Just because you're
the world's greatest batboy

193
00:20:01,186 --> 00:20:03,821
doesn't mean that you're ready
to pinch hit for the Yankees.

194
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:10,162
In other words...

195
00:20:10,196 --> 00:20:12,965
finish training you must.

196
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:16,569
Save you it will, Luke.

197
00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:21,341
Maybe I'll
throw you some consulting work,

198
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,976
just to keep your dick wet.

199
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,046
That'd be great.

200
00:20:27,782 --> 00:20:28,949
This is the lake of fire.

201
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:30,417
It's the last of seven keys

202
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:32,085
that's supposed to bring about
the end of the world.

203
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:33,520
It was Travis' last tableau.

204
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:37,457
A picture taken last night
about seven miles off the coast.

205
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:38,859
Some guy in an airplane saw it

206
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:40,427
and took a picture
with his cell phone.

207
00:20:40,462 --> 00:20:42,596
Now based on this, I'm thinking

208
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,932
that Travis has already
completed tableau number seven.

209
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:47,400
- Does anyone think I'm wrong?
- I think we're in agreement.

210
00:20:47,435 --> 00:20:49,102
We've got the coast guard
out there, looking for signs

211
00:20:49,136 --> 00:20:50,937
of a wreck or a body, but nothing yet.

212
00:20:50,971 --> 00:20:52,738
'Cause I'm right here.

213
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:54,673
So Travis is done with his work.

214
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,441
- So now what?
- Well, now all Travis has to do

215
00:20:56,475 --> 00:20:57,709
is sit back and wait
for the end of the world.

216
00:20:57,743 --> 00:20:59,411
Which means he could be anywhere.

217
00:20:59,445 --> 00:21:00,612
Or maybe not.

218
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:02,514
Maybe he's somewhere very specific.

219
00:21:02,548 --> 00:21:04,182
Somewhere where
we can grab his crazy ass.

220
00:21:04,217 --> 00:21:08,220
Check this out.

221
00:21:10,891 --> 00:21:12,458
Um...

222
00:21:12,493 --> 00:21:14,528
This is Gellar's last sketch.

223
00:21:14,562 --> 00:21:17,264
- The two witnesses.
- Yeah.

224
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:18,766
And their dog.

225
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,968
I guess Fido wanted to watch
the end of the world too.

226
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:23,704
So you're thinking if Travis
is following Gellar's drawings,

227
00:21:23,738 --> 00:21:25,606
this points to where he'll be next?

228
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,575
And what time he'll be there.

229
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:31,078
All this shit's gonna go down
when the eclipse is happening.

230
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:32,279
Which is four hours from now.

231
00:21:32,313 --> 00:21:34,548
Where do you go to watch an eclipse?

232
00:21:34,582 --> 00:21:36,216
Well, you'd want a good view.

233
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,185
- No obstructions.
- High ground.

234
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,753
Yeah, look where they are.
They're on a mountaintop.

235
00:21:40,788 --> 00:21:42,588
Could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure

236
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:44,490
there are no mountains in Miami.

237
00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:45,758
Unless you find a substitute.

238
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:48,627
- Fuckin' A.
- Skyscrapers.

239
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,996
Fuckin' big-ass,
tall-as-shit skyscrapers.

240
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,731
- Makes sense.
- It does, right?

241
00:21:52,765 --> 00:21:54,232
I'm gonna call Laguerta.

242
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:57,001
I want to station unis on top
of Miami's tallest buildings.

243
00:21:57,036 --> 00:21:58,669
There's a lot
of tall buildings in Miami.

244
00:21:58,703 --> 00:22:00,570
I mean, that's gonna require
a lot of manpower.

245
00:22:00,605 --> 00:22:01,972
I don't care.
If Travis gets away,

246
00:22:02,006 --> 00:22:06,676
he is gone for good.

247
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,483
Travis redid
that same sketch yesterday,

248
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:15,618
and it looks different.

249
00:22:20,491 --> 00:22:23,360
I thought it was a mountain,
but maybe it's a building.

250
00:22:23,394 --> 00:22:25,762
What was the last thing
Travis said to me?

251
00:22:25,797 --> 00:22:30,000
He'd be standing atop
a shining pillar of light.

252
00:22:57,297 --> 00:22:59,131
"The solar-powered
Transcorp building

253
00:22:59,165 --> 00:23:01,600
"was designed to capture
and reflect the sun

254
00:23:01,634 --> 00:23:05,871
as it moves
across the Miami sky."

255
00:23:05,905 --> 00:23:07,873
A pillar of light.

256
00:23:13,212 --> 00:23:16,281
- Hey.
- Hey.

257
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:17,615
The abandoned church

258
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,884
where Travis and Gellar
were hanging out--

259
00:23:18,918 --> 00:23:22,487
What about it?

260
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:24,088
I need you to do
a final forensic sweep,

261
00:23:24,123 --> 00:23:27,191
so we can clear it.

262
00:23:27,226 --> 00:23:31,930
I have Harrison's Noah's ark
pageant this afternoon.

263
00:23:31,964 --> 00:23:33,097
I promised him.

264
00:23:33,132 --> 00:23:36,568
Oh, afterwards then.

265
00:23:36,602 --> 00:23:38,403
Copy that.

266
00:23:38,437 --> 00:23:41,506
Hey, um...

267
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:46,111
What?

268
00:23:46,146 --> 00:23:50,449
Do we need to talk?

269
00:23:50,484 --> 00:23:55,922
I don't know, is there
something we should talk about?

270
00:23:56,991 --> 00:23:59,794
I don't know, you almost died.

271
00:23:59,828 --> 00:24:03,564
I didn't know if you need to...

272
00:24:03,598 --> 00:24:08,201
unload or whatever.

273
00:24:08,236 --> 00:24:12,338
I think I'm okay, but thanks, sis.

274
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:14,607
Great.

275
00:24:14,642 --> 00:24:15,742
Don't forget about the church.

276
00:24:15,776 --> 00:24:18,444
Got it.

277
00:24:19,512 --> 00:24:21,947
I have plans for that church.

278
00:24:30,256 --> 00:24:32,891
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

279
00:24:32,926 --> 00:24:34,326
This is exactly why I'm doing this.

280
00:24:34,361 --> 00:24:35,928
You never take anything seriously.

281
00:24:35,962 --> 00:24:37,329
Why you're doing what?

282
00:24:37,364 --> 00:24:40,232
I wanted to give you the
heads up about your transfer.

283
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:43,401
What fucking transfer?
I didn't ask for a transfer.

284
00:24:43,436 --> 00:24:44,603
I'm putting one in for you.

285
00:24:44,637 --> 00:24:46,438
- The fuck you are.
- I am.

286
00:24:46,472 --> 00:24:50,242
You've been screwing up
for the last few months.

287
00:24:50,276 --> 00:24:53,278
And when you
almost got me killed--

288
00:24:53,312 --> 00:24:55,347
- I thought we settled that.
- We did.

289
00:24:55,381 --> 00:24:58,183
But as sergeant, I can't risk myself

290
00:24:58,217 --> 00:25:00,452
or anyone else here
in Homicide anymore.

291
00:25:06,025 --> 00:25:08,093
Good talk, sergeant.

292
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:10,329
So even though Travis Marshall
killed Gellar--

293
00:25:10,363 --> 00:25:12,231
at some point,
we're not sure when--

294
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:14,266
he's still recreating images
from Gellar's sketchbook,

295
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:15,768
and this is the last one.

296
00:25:15,802 --> 00:25:19,505
It's two witnesses looking at
the eclipse from a mountaintop.

297
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,808
And skyscrapers
are the mountaintops of Miami.

298
00:25:21,842 --> 00:25:24,443
So you think that
Travis Marshall will watch

299
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:26,345
the eclipse from a skyscraper.

300
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,180
Can you narrow down which one?

301
00:25:28,214 --> 00:25:30,549
The four seasons is
the tallest building in Miami,

302
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:31,983
but we're not sure
where he'll show up.

303
00:25:32,018 --> 00:25:34,686
And that's why I want
to put unis on top

304
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,489
of every building over 400 feet.

305
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:43,193
- Do it.
- You're agreeing with me?

306
00:25:43,228 --> 00:25:45,529
If you think this is
the best use of your resources,

307
00:25:45,564 --> 00:25:47,732
I trust your judgment.

308
00:25:47,766 --> 00:25:49,300
Yeah, so when this
blows up in my face,

309
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:52,837
you can fire my ass.

310
00:25:52,872 --> 00:25:54,472
I know that you think
that I'm some heartless bitch,

311
00:25:54,507 --> 00:25:56,709
and sometimes I have to be.

312
00:25:56,743 --> 00:25:58,577
But everything I do is always

313
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:00,379
in the best interest of Miami Metro.

314
00:26:00,414 --> 00:26:02,815
Matthews might disagree with that.

315
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,317
Well, Matthews put his dick
before his department.

316
00:26:04,352 --> 00:26:05,785
Yeah, and you cut it off.

317
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:08,821
You didn't hesitate to take
advantage of that situation.

318
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:11,223
Was that really the best
for Miami Metro?

319
00:26:11,258 --> 00:26:14,727
Morgan, we need
to get Travis Marshall.

320
00:26:14,761 --> 00:26:16,729
All I need to know is
will this plan of yours work?

321
00:26:16,763 --> 00:26:18,564
Yes.

322
00:26:18,598 --> 00:26:23,134
Then count on having
all the manpower you need.

323
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:19,051
Did you look under your bed?

324
00:28:20,921 --> 00:28:23,021
Maybe blanky's in here.

325
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:41,372
We're going to be late.

326
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,780
Here it is.

327
00:28:50,617 --> 00:28:55,956
Ugh, Dexter.

328
00:29:01,964 --> 00:29:03,731
Okay, let's go.

329
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:56,048
So the beast has a son.

330
00:30:22,144 --> 00:30:24,445
Just in time for the flood.

331
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,647
Sorry I'm late.

332
00:30:25,681 --> 00:30:26,747
I was getting worried
the world would have

333
00:30:26,782 --> 00:30:28,916
to make do with only one lion.

334
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,018
Just a few minutes, everybody,
before the show begins.

335
00:30:31,052 --> 00:30:34,588
- Break a leg, you two.
- Okay, bud.

336
00:30:34,623 --> 00:30:36,824
Remember what the lions say?

337
00:30:41,563 --> 00:30:44,164
Sorry.
It's okay, it's okay.

338
00:30:44,198 --> 00:30:48,736
We're lions.
That's just what lions do.

339
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,906
All right, now we got
an ark to get on.

340
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,308
And that boat has a place
for all the animals,

341
00:30:54,343 --> 00:30:56,577
not just the sheep and the zebras,

342
00:30:56,612 --> 00:30:58,713
but the lions too.

343
00:30:58,747 --> 00:31:00,982
I'll be right with you, by your side.

344
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:03,184
Let's get that mask on.

345
00:31:05,554 --> 00:31:10,624
Two by two,
the animals went inside the ark.

346
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:15,629
The bunny rabbits, the tigers,

347
00:31:15,664 --> 00:31:18,032
even the lions.

348
00:31:18,066 --> 00:31:20,301
All of God's creatures.

349
00:31:20,335 --> 00:31:25,805
Noah welcomed them all on his boat.

350
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:33,312
And the rain kept falling
for 40 days and 40 nights,

351
00:31:33,347 --> 00:31:37,182
until the whole world
was covered in water.

352
00:31:42,088 --> 00:31:45,357
The tallest building in Miami
is the Four Seasons building,

353
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:47,959
and this is where we believe
Travis Marshall will be.

354
00:31:47,994 --> 00:31:49,794
Sergeant Batista and Detective Quinn

355
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:52,197
will accompany the two officers
that are stationed there.

356
00:31:52,231 --> 00:31:55,934
If you see Travis Marshall
or contact is made,

357
00:31:55,968 --> 00:31:57,702
call for backup immediately.

358
00:31:57,736 --> 00:32:01,772
He is highly unpredictable
and very dangerous.

359
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:04,074
Let's go get this fucker.

360
00:32:06,078 --> 00:32:07,612
Check in with me every 15, okay?

361
00:32:07,646 --> 00:32:08,613
I want to stay on top of this.

362
00:32:08,647 --> 00:32:10,448
I spoke to my union rep.

363
00:32:10,482 --> 00:32:12,717
We decided I have
a problem with alcohol,

364
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:15,586
and, um, as long as I seek help
and admit it,

365
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,188
I can't be transferred or fired.

366
00:32:18,223 --> 00:32:19,190
It's a disease.

367
00:32:19,224 --> 00:32:21,659
Are you shitting me?

368
00:32:21,694 --> 00:32:23,795
That rule is for people
that really have a problem.

369
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,064
You're not an alcoholic,
you're just a fuckup.

370
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:29,101
Look, you said
to take control of my life.

371
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:31,570
That's what I'm trying to do, okay?

372
00:32:31,604 --> 00:32:32,771
I like Homicide.

373
00:32:32,806 --> 00:32:34,640
I'm in it for the long haul.

374
00:32:34,675 --> 00:32:37,310
Why can't you put this much
effort into actual police work?

375
00:32:41,682 --> 00:32:43,950
We remind you to not
look directly at the sun.

376
00:32:43,984 --> 00:32:45,952
The eclipse will happen
within the hour.

377
00:32:45,986 --> 00:32:47,886
And the two witnesses
will watch the world end...

378
00:32:47,921 --> 00:32:51,156
with their dog.
I still don't get the dog.

379
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,290
Why do they want to bring the dog?

380
00:32:52,325 --> 00:32:54,425
Are you sure that's a dog?

381
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,427
What else could it be?

382
00:32:56,461 --> 00:32:59,596
A sheep, a lamb.
Lamb of God?

383
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,898
A lamb.
We've seen that before.

384
00:33:01,932 --> 00:33:02,933
Yeah, it was that hot chick
that Quinn fucked.

385
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:05,602
Carissa Porter, right.

386
00:33:05,636 --> 00:33:07,304
She was in that tableau
that Gellar staged

387
00:33:07,338 --> 00:33:08,371
at the University of Tallahassee.

388
00:33:08,406 --> 00:33:09,806
She slaughtered a lamb.

389
00:33:09,841 --> 00:33:11,642
The school newspaper sent the
contact sheets from that day,

390
00:33:11,676 --> 00:33:14,178
and I've got them right here.

391
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,648
The lamb has only an Omega
on its forehead--no Alpha.

392
00:33:18,683 --> 00:33:21,551
An omega.
The end.

393
00:33:21,586 --> 00:33:23,220
Killing the lamb signifies the end.

394
00:33:23,254 --> 00:33:24,321
Holy fuck.

395
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:27,458
What if Travis isn't done killing?

396
00:33:32,997 --> 00:33:33,964
Deb.

397
00:33:33,998 --> 00:33:35,966
I think Travis is gonna kill again.

398
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,634
When?

399
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:40,270
Before the eclipse.

400
00:33:40,305 --> 00:33:44,408
That's an hour from now.

401
00:33:44,443 --> 00:33:46,444
I know, but I think
he's gonna make a sacrifice.

402
00:33:46,478 --> 00:33:47,979
An offering to his God.

403
00:33:48,013 --> 00:33:52,283
It makes sense, right?

404
00:33:52,318 --> 00:33:55,087
A spilling of blood to bless
the new world.

405
00:33:55,121 --> 00:33:56,722
I mean, I'm not 100% sure,
but--

406
00:33:56,757 --> 00:33:58,291
In the last drawing
from Gellar's book,

407
00:33:58,325 --> 00:34:00,627
one of the witnesses has a sword,

408
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:02,328
and the animal
approaching them is--

409
00:34:02,362 --> 00:34:03,729
A lamb.

410
00:34:03,764 --> 00:34:06,132
And that tableau that Gellar did
on campus a few years back--

411
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:07,933
the slaughter
of a lamb--

412
00:34:07,968 --> 00:34:09,936
I don't know what a "lamb"
means to this crazy prick.

413
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,237
It could be an actual lamb,

414
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:12,538
I-it could be
an innocent of some kind,

415
00:34:12,573 --> 00:34:17,110
but I think that
could be his next kill.

416
00:34:17,144 --> 00:34:19,646
I gotta go.

417
00:34:24,185 --> 00:34:26,186
Excuse me, sister?
Have you seen Harrison?

418
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,455
Uh, yes.
He just left.

419
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:29,856
He left?

420
00:34:29,891 --> 00:34:31,892
He was with a man
wearing a lion's mask.

421
00:34:31,926 --> 00:34:32,893
I thought it was you.

422
00:34:32,927 --> 00:34:35,396
Where'd they go?

423
00:34:45,773 --> 00:34:47,808
? The time is nigh ?

424
00:34:47,842 --> 00:34:50,443
? and the end is near ?

425
00:34:50,477 --> 00:34:52,511
? It's time for God's children ?

426
00:34:52,546 --> 00:34:54,313
? to listen and hear ?

427
00:34:54,347 --> 00:34:56,615
? for his word has said ?

428
00:34:56,649 --> 00:35:00,118
? that the world will end ?

429
00:35:00,152 --> 00:35:02,387
? and the mountain will fall ?

430
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:04,623
? when he comes again ?

431
00:35:16,704 --> 00:35:18,772
Hey!

432
00:35:18,807 --> 00:35:20,207
Hey, little boy!

433
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:23,911
Hey, come back here!

434
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:44,998
The time is 3:26.
Get ready for the eclipse.

435
00:35:45,032 --> 00:35:46,332
Should all be in place by now, right?

436
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:48,101
Yeah.

437
00:35:48,135 --> 00:35:50,771
Four Seasons, this is
Lieutenant Morgan.

438
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:51,906
We're all clear up here.

439
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,242
No sign of Travis
or a lamb of any kind.

440
00:35:54,276 --> 00:35:55,743
Copy that.

441
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,447
Miami Tower, this is
Lieutenant Morgan. All clear?

442
00:35:58,481 --> 00:36:00,716
All clear.

443
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,217
Copy that.

444
00:36:02,252 --> 00:36:04,353
Transcorp building,
this is Lieutenant Morgan.

445
00:36:04,387 --> 00:36:08,424
All clear?

446
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,458
Transcorp.

447
00:36:12,028 --> 00:36:15,497
Transcorp?

448
00:36:15,531 --> 00:36:20,001
All clear.

449
00:36:28,076 --> 00:36:30,177
? So jump to the sky ?

450
00:36:30,212 --> 00:36:33,181
? repent of your sins ?

451
00:36:33,215 --> 00:36:38,553
? run to your savior ?

452
00:36:38,587 --> 00:36:42,323
? and you'll be saved again ?

453
00:36:44,893 --> 00:36:45,860
It is done.

454
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:52,900
I am the Alpha and the Omega.

455
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:59,240
I am the beginning and the end.

456
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:02,243
I am making everything new.

457
00:37:02,278 --> 00:37:06,080
No!
Stop!

458
00:37:06,114 --> 00:37:09,617
- What?
- Get away from him!

459
00:37:09,651 --> 00:37:11,185
I killed you.
Stay back!

460
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:14,021
You're supposed to be dead.

461
00:37:14,055 --> 00:37:16,924
How's the world going to end
if the beast is still alive?

462
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:18,592
It won't.

463
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:23,765
Until the beast is dead,
a sacrifice is meaningless.

464
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:25,266
Time is running out, Travis.

465
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,301
I know that.

466
00:37:27,335 --> 00:37:29,337
Stay there.

467
00:37:29,371 --> 00:37:31,206
Take me, and let my son go.

468
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,242
You need me.
You don't need him.

469
00:37:34,277 --> 00:37:36,078
Let him go.
Take him to the elevator.

470
00:37:36,112 --> 00:37:40,049
Do you have any
of your needles with you?

471
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,050
Yes.

472
00:37:41,084 --> 00:37:43,919
Let's see it.

473
00:37:43,954 --> 00:37:46,955
Show me.

474
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,594
Inject yourself.

475
00:37:53,629 --> 00:37:57,898
I will, but not until you let him go.

476
00:38:06,907 --> 00:38:10,042
It's okay, buddy.

477
00:38:18,118 --> 00:38:19,118
Stop!

478
00:38:19,153 --> 00:38:23,490
You stay there!

479
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:34,166
Inject yourself, or I'll kill him.

480
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:37,436
Do it now!

481
00:39:08,504 --> 00:39:12,440
The eclipse is here, Travis.

482
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:24,151
Daddy's here.

483
00:39:36,633 --> 00:39:39,835
Looks like the moon has just
finished traversing the sun.

484
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,170
Lieutenant, it's the Four Seasons.

485
00:39:41,205 --> 00:39:42,505
We're all clear.

486
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:44,473
Miami Tower, all clear.

487
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:46,475
Marquis, all clear.

488
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,978
50 Biscayne, all clear.

489
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,413
The eclipse is over,
and nothing happened.

490
00:39:50,447 --> 00:39:52,715
Marinablue, all clear.

491
00:39:52,749 --> 00:39:54,383
400 Main, all clear.

492
00:39:54,417 --> 00:40:00,189
Transcorp hasn't checked in.

493
00:40:00,223 --> 00:40:01,490
Transcorp, this is Lieutenant Morgan.

494
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:03,259
Are you there?

495
00:40:03,293 --> 00:40:05,528
Are you there?

496
00:40:05,562 --> 00:40:09,732
Transcorp, do you copy?

497
00:40:09,766 --> 00:40:12,000
God fucking damn it!

498
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,473
10-1, 10-1.

499
00:40:17,507 --> 00:40:19,975
Officer down on top
of the Transcorp building.

500
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:21,877
Get the paramedics up here now.

501
00:40:21,912 --> 00:40:23,679
Search every fucking inch
of this place!

502
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:25,281
- Yes, ma'am.
- First quadrant, clear.

503
00:40:25,316 --> 00:40:27,617
- Second quadrant, clear.
- Third quadrant, clear.

504
00:40:27,651 --> 00:40:30,220
- Fourth quadrant, clear.
- All clear.

505
00:40:30,254 --> 00:40:32,455
No sign of Marshall.

506
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,192
Lieutenant!

507
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:43,233
What the fuck is that?

508
00:40:43,268 --> 00:40:45,102
Looks like it was some kind of altar.

509
00:40:45,136 --> 00:40:48,038
Maybe the officer was the sacrifice.

510
00:40:48,072 --> 00:40:49,973
Let's go!

511
00:40:50,007 --> 00:40:53,610
- South quadrant.
- Right now.

512
00:40:53,644 --> 00:40:55,278
It's the other side.

513
00:40:55,313 --> 00:40:57,347
Deb, what happened?

514
00:40:57,381 --> 00:40:58,448
He got away.

515
00:40:58,482 --> 00:41:00,049
Lieutenant, the officer's dead.

516
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:04,988
Deb, you okay?

517
00:41:05,022 --> 00:41:07,424
What does it matter?

518
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:09,359
What does any of it fucking matter?

519
00:41:09,394 --> 00:41:10,360
Shit.

520
00:41:16,133 --> 00:41:18,602
Where's Morgan?

521
00:41:18,636 --> 00:41:21,238
She needed a moment alone.

522
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:26,577
She's over there.

523
00:41:29,681 --> 00:41:35,118
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.

524
00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:38,187
Don't, okay?

525
00:41:38,222 --> 00:41:42,792
You made the right call.

526
00:41:42,826 --> 00:41:46,495
What is this, you being understanding?

527
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,165
Pragmatic.

528
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:50,267
You kick a horse during the race,

529
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:54,572
not after it's over.

530
00:41:56,075 --> 00:41:59,044
Travis Marshall was here.

531
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:01,447
Yeah, and an officer is dead--

532
00:42:01,481 --> 00:42:02,815
Because of Travis Marshall.

533
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,550
Who's still out there.

534
00:42:04,585 --> 00:42:06,786
Who knows what he'll do next?
He's capable of anything.

535
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,920
And if he fucking disappears,

536
00:42:07,954 --> 00:42:11,156
this case could stay open forever.

537
00:42:11,191 --> 00:42:13,459
You'd always have that
to throw back in my face.

538
00:42:13,493 --> 00:42:16,028
I won't do that.

539
00:42:16,062 --> 00:42:19,030
Why, it's not best for Miami Metro?

540
00:42:19,064 --> 00:42:22,500
Because you'll find him.

541
00:42:22,535 --> 00:42:26,872
You have the potential
to be a good lieutenant,

542
00:42:26,906 --> 00:42:30,009
but you need to prioritize.

543
00:42:30,044 --> 00:42:34,147
You're letting your emotions
take charge of you.

544
00:42:37,185 --> 00:42:38,485
You know what worked for me?

545
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:42,723
Making my job the center of my life.

546
00:42:42,757 --> 00:42:44,792
Puts everything else in perspective

547
00:42:44,827 --> 00:42:47,661
because the control is all mine.

548
00:42:47,696 --> 00:42:50,398
And that's what you need to do, Deb.

549
00:42:50,432 --> 00:42:53,367
Take control.

550
00:43:20,428 --> 00:43:22,096
One thing I'm sure I have faith in

551
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:26,201
is the staying power
of animal tranquilizers.

552
00:43:26,235 --> 00:43:29,805
Is that my shirt?

553
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,384
The mighty kings return!

554
00:43:42,418 --> 00:43:45,054
It's a jungle out there.

555
00:43:45,088 --> 00:43:46,888
Here, I'll put him to bed.

556
00:43:46,923 --> 00:43:49,424
No, I-- I got it.
I--I have to go back out.

557
00:43:49,459 --> 00:43:52,427
Oh.
Late night?

558
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:53,628
Oh, probably not too late.

559
00:43:53,663 --> 00:43:56,131
Deb wants me to go back
to a crime scene,

560
00:43:56,165 --> 00:43:58,066
collect some evidence.

561
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,067
Okay.

562
00:43:59,102 --> 00:44:00,669
Let me see those paws.

563
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:03,072
Let me see those paws.

564
00:44:03,106 --> 00:44:04,573
Let me see those--

565
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:06,709
I'm glad you're safe.

566
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:14,517
Whether you're a lion or a lamb,
I'll always love you.

567
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:24,294
Maybe that's all I need
to pass on to you.

568
00:44:41,977 --> 00:44:43,010
You were right.

569
00:44:43,045 --> 00:44:44,178
Debra, we can schedule a time--

570
00:44:44,213 --> 00:44:47,249
I told him.

571
00:44:47,283 --> 00:44:49,385
I fucking told my brother
that I love him,

572
00:44:49,419 --> 00:44:52,355
and he said "I love you" back.

573
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:55,192
Not "Me too" or something like that.

574
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:57,962
He actually said,
"I love you."

575
00:44:57,996 --> 00:44:59,197
Wow.
That's big, isn't it?

576
00:44:59,231 --> 00:45:00,765
Yeah, I mean,
I don't think he understood

577
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,867
that I'm <i>in love</i> with him,

578
00:45:01,901 --> 00:45:05,603
but still, he said the actual words...

579
00:45:05,638 --> 00:45:07,639
for the first time.

580
00:45:07,673 --> 00:45:09,140
So what do you think it means?

581
00:45:09,174 --> 00:45:10,642
I don't know what the fuck it means.

582
00:45:10,677 --> 00:45:15,547
That's why I'm here.

583
00:45:15,582 --> 00:45:20,152
Is this just...

584
00:45:20,186 --> 00:45:23,755
horribly wrong?

585
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,991
Does it feel wrong?

586
00:45:26,025 --> 00:45:30,595
It makes my whole life--

587
00:45:33,866 --> 00:45:37,436
Every man I've ever loved--
make sense.

588
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:40,973
It's like I've always been
looking for someone like Dexter

589
00:45:41,007 --> 00:45:43,708
or someone who's
the opposite of Dexter

590
00:45:43,743 --> 00:45:44,876
as a way to avoid the fact

591
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:49,381
that I'm in love with him.

592
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:52,718
That's just clear to me now,

593
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:55,887
and I want it to be clear to him.

594
00:45:55,922 --> 00:45:57,555
I want him to understand.

595
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:00,658
Okay.

596
00:46:00,692 --> 00:46:02,092
You want to tell him how you feel

597
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:04,128
in a way that he can hear you.

598
00:46:04,162 --> 00:46:08,867
Yes.

599
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:11,703
Is this how it feels

600
00:46:11,738 --> 00:46:15,541
to be in control of your emotions?

601
00:46:15,576 --> 00:46:18,144
But you can't control his.

602
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:22,149
You don't know
how he's going to react.

603
00:46:39,733 --> 00:46:44,936
Hello, Jesus.

604
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:46,405
Hello, Travis.

605
00:46:46,439 --> 00:46:50,008
What?
What is going on?

606
00:46:50,043 --> 00:46:55,647
This is the way the world ends.

607
00:46:55,682 --> 00:46:57,582
- Your world, anyway.
- No!

608
00:46:57,617 --> 00:46:58,817
No, no!

609
00:46:58,851 --> 00:47:00,986
I'm supposed to finish
enacting the seven keys.

610
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:02,254
Sorry.

611
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:03,989
But I was chosen!

612
00:47:04,024 --> 00:47:06,759
I was chosen to bring
about the new world.

613
00:47:06,793 --> 00:47:08,194
Chosen to kill innocent people?

614
00:47:08,228 --> 00:47:10,262
No one is innocent.

615
00:47:10,297 --> 00:47:11,764
My son is.
You tried to kill him.

616
00:47:11,798 --> 00:47:13,999
God--God allowed
his son to die.

617
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:16,635
How could you believe in that?

618
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:19,438
Because I walk the path
of the righteous.

619
00:47:19,473 --> 00:47:22,508
I've known people who believed in God.

620
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:24,509
They would never use their faith

621
00:47:24,544 --> 00:47:28,513
as a convenient excuse
to kill ten people.

622
00:47:28,548 --> 00:47:31,150
You used God.

623
00:47:31,184 --> 00:47:33,085
It's not the other way around.

624
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,390
You--

625
00:47:37,424 --> 00:47:40,159
You are a shining example

626
00:47:40,194 --> 00:47:44,730
of how putrid man has become.

627
00:47:44,765 --> 00:47:48,735
I am a father.

628
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:51,704
A son.

629
00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:56,041
A serial killer.

630
00:47:56,075 --> 00:47:58,743
You're going to burn in hell.

631
00:47:58,777 --> 00:48:03,548
No, I think I belong right here.

632
00:48:07,186 --> 00:48:08,587
Because maybe there is a place

633
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:13,625
for me in this world...

634
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:18,496
just as I am.

635
00:48:18,531 --> 00:48:23,034
Light cannot exist without darkness.

636
00:48:23,069 --> 00:48:27,973
Each has its purpose.

637
00:48:28,008 --> 00:48:31,010
And if there is a purpose
to my darkness,

638
00:48:31,044 --> 00:48:35,081
maybe it's to bring some...

639
00:48:35,115 --> 00:48:38,084
balance to the world.

640
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,093
Because, let's face it,

641
00:48:47,128 --> 00:48:52,365
the world is going to be
a better place without you.

642
00:48:52,399 --> 00:48:54,400
The world is going to end.

643
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:56,435
And when it does,

644
00:48:56,469 --> 00:48:58,770
I will be by God's side.

645
00:48:58,804 --> 00:49:01,439
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

646
00:49:01,473 --> 00:49:05,276
Good for you.

647
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,078
You're mocking me.

648
00:49:07,112 --> 00:49:09,680
No, I almost envy you.

649
00:49:09,715 --> 00:49:14,051
It must be nice to be so certain.

650
00:49:14,086 --> 00:49:16,220
You're wrong about everything

651
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:18,655
because you don't believe in God,

652
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:20,757
but I have faith.

653
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:24,161
- I trust in God's plan.
- Really?

654
00:49:24,195 --> 00:49:25,329
Then it must be God's plan

655
00:49:25,363 --> 00:49:29,366
that you're on my table.

656
00:49:31,503 --> 00:49:35,106
Do you think it's God's will
that I'm about to kill you?

657
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,808
God has nothing to do with this!

658
00:49:37,843 --> 00:49:40,511
You are wrapped in plastic

659
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:46,517
because I want to kill you.

660
00:49:46,552 --> 00:49:50,187
This is not how it's supposed to be!

661
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:54,926
Maybe this is exactly
how it's supposed to be.

662
00:49:56,662 --> 00:50:00,198
Maybe everything is exactly

663
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:06,004
as it should be.

664
00:50:11,544 --> 00:50:13,512
Oh, God.

665
