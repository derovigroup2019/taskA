2
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:56,293
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:56,394 --> 00:01:58,429
If I do happen to find her,

4
00:01:58,463 --> 00:01:59,630
you'll get your reward money.

5
00:01:59,664 --> 00:02:01,109
- Oh, shit.
- Who's that?

6
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:02,399
Federal marshal.

7
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:04,429
Dexter Morgan, what the hell
are you doing here?

8
00:02:04,553 --> 00:02:08,289
Arlene's a friend.
We met through Hannah.

9
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:09,824
It's not safe for you to go back
to the hotel.

10
00:02:09,858 --> 00:02:12,560
- You need something private.
- What the fuck?

11
00:02:12,595 --> 00:02:13,628
It's only for a couple
of nights.

12
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:15,363
Couple of nights?
That's it.

13
00:02:15,397 --> 00:02:16,998
Sorry I'm not Deb.

14
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:20,201
She's always accusing me
of comparing you to her.

15
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:25,540
Welcome back to Homicide,
detective.

16
00:02:25,574 --> 00:02:28,509
I just need some time
to think about it.

17
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:30,111
Take all the time you need.

18
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:32,180
There's no life for me here
in Florida.

19
00:02:32,214 --> 00:02:34,849
I can have a life somewhere else
far away from here--

20
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:37,218
in Argentina.
Maybe we all can.

21
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:41,389
Yes. Me, you, and Harrison
are gonna move to Argentina.

22
00:02:41,423 --> 00:02:43,458
Zach's killer is related
to you.

23
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:45,727
The brain surgeon is related
to you.

24
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:47,795
I had two sons,
Daniel and Richard.

25
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,099
- My older son...Daniel....
- He killed Richard.

26
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:53,234
Then we put Daniel into
a mental health institute.

27
00:02:53,268 --> 00:02:54,969
That guy Cassie was dating...

28
00:02:56,271 --> 00:02:58,706
Daniel Vogel is Oliver Saxon.

29
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:01,409
Suppose you do find him,
Dexter.

30
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:02,543
What are you going to do?

31
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:04,412
He's murdered four
innocent people,

32
00:03:04,446 --> 00:03:05,813
and he killed Jack Hamilton.

33
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:07,515
He's my son.

34
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:10,852
He got away.

35
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:12,186
That's why I'm here,
to warn you.

36
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:13,388
I think it best,
from here on out,

37
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:15,189
that I handle this myself.

38
00:03:15,224 --> 00:03:18,426
Vogel is on her own,
and so am I.

39
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,763
I'll kill Saxon
and leave Miami forever.

40
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:25,566
So now do you believe me?

41
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:27,235
Yes.

42
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:41,082
Feels good to cook
for you again.

43
00:03:41,116 --> 00:03:46,054
It reminds me of what
it was like to be your mother.

44
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:53,861
You think fixing breakfast
makes you my mother again?

45
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:55,897
- No.
- You gave up the privilege

46
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,265
a long time ago.

47
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,702
Daniel, whatever mistakes
I've made in the past,

48
00:04:00,736 --> 00:04:03,771
I wan to make it up to you.

49
00:04:03,806 --> 00:04:04,772
I can help you.

50
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:06,207
Help me how?

51
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:08,876
I can arrange
for the care you need.

52
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:12,046
The care I need?

53
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:15,116
I will <i>never</i>
be locked up again.

54
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,151
I have contacts
at the best facilities.

55
00:04:17,186 --> 00:04:19,754
Like the last one
you sent me to?

56
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:22,457
Do you know what that was like?

57
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:25,827
Day after day wondering when
you'd finally come to visit,

58
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:27,895
only to realize
that the answer was <i>never!</i>

59
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,567
Daniel, I couldn't.
You'd killed Richard.

60
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:35,803
That was <i>your</i> fault!

61
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:40,274
You ignored me.

62
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:44,011
All you ever cared about
was Richard.

63
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:45,813
You never tried to help me.

64
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,285
I was young, inexperienced.

65
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,521
I didn't know how to help you.

66
00:04:53,555 --> 00:04:57,291
But you sure as hell knew how
to help Dexter Morgan.

67
00:04:57,326 --> 00:05:00,294
You taught him how to deal
with his condition.

68
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:03,865
You gave him everything
you denied me.

69
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:07,535
While I was rotting away,
you gave him a life.

70
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:09,737
I know that.
I do.

71
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:11,506
It was a horrible mistake.

72
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,277
I was your son.
I needed you.

73
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:18,980
- Please...
- Please <i>what?</i>

74
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:21,983
Let me help you.

75
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:24,318
I'm sorry for everything
I've done.

76
00:05:24,353 --> 00:05:27,255
I truly, truly am.

77
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:34,195
I wish I could believe you.

78
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:53,714
Hannah.

79
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:55,850
Hey, Harrison.

80
00:05:55,884 --> 00:05:58,586
Oh, I missed you.
Aw.

81
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,254
Hey, soon you'll be able
to spend

82
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:01,529
all the time you want with her,

83
00:06:01,557 --> 00:06:04,192
but right now, Hannah and I need
to have a grown-up talk.

84
00:06:04,226 --> 00:06:07,929
- Okay, bud?
- Okay.

85
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:12,200
So...

86
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:14,268
- some potentially good news.
- Yeah?

87
00:06:14,303 --> 00:06:16,437
Deputy marshal Clayton
stopped by my place.

88
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:19,540
It seems like he's backing off
on his search for you.

89
00:06:19,575 --> 00:06:21,375
Oh, that's a huge relief.

90
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,877
Even so, he managed to get
your face all over the news.

91
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:25,079
You still need to lay low.

92
00:06:25,113 --> 00:06:28,216
So how am I gonna
get out of Miami?

93
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,385
Well, no one's looking
for a woman

94
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,254
traveling with her husband
and child.

95
00:06:33,288 --> 00:06:37,191
I'm thinking the three of us
could leave together.

96
00:06:37,226 --> 00:06:39,727
I like the sound of that.

97
00:06:43,832 --> 00:06:45,132
There's still so much to do.

98
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:48,035
I've gotta tell Batista
I'm leaving...

99
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,037
get Harrison out of school,

100
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:52,306
see Astor and Cody
one more time.

101
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:55,877
I need to list my condo,
sell my boat, my car.

102
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:59,113
Deb can help out
with all that stuff.

103
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:01,449
Wow.

104
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:02,984
We're really gonna do it.

105
00:07:03,018 --> 00:07:06,487
Yeah.
We're moving to Argentina.

106
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:09,724
God, that was always
such a fantasy

107
00:07:09,758 --> 00:07:12,226
I never thought that
it would actually happen.

108
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:15,162
Otherwise I would have
learned Spanish.

109
00:07:15,197 --> 00:07:17,064
We'll learn together.

110
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:19,100
We'll be leaving soon.

111
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:21,135
I have to kill Saxon first.

112
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:24,171
Oh, so you are gonna
go through with it.

113
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:27,441
I have to.

114
00:07:27,476 --> 00:07:29,110
Vogel's not thinking clearly.

115
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:31,412
She doesn't seem to realize
she's in danger.

116
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:33,247
I feel like I need
to protect her.

117
00:07:33,282 --> 00:07:35,283
You feel like you need to?

118
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:38,619
Yeah.

119
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:40,955
- What?
- It's just...

120
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:43,257
when it comes to you
and killing,

121
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:45,726
feelings never enter
the equation.

122
00:07:49,197 --> 00:07:50,398
She needs me to protect her.

123
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:56,437
Hey! Stay off
aunt Deb's treadmill.

124
00:07:56,471 --> 00:07:58,105
But it's fun.

125
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,240
No, it's not for kids.

126
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:00,741
Hey, come here.
I want to hear all about

127
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:02,443
what you've been doing
for the last eight months.

128
00:08:02,477 --> 00:08:04,278
Okay.

129
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:10,952
- Hi, Aunt Deb.
- Hi.

130
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:14,355
- Come on.
- Can we talk?

131
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:23,831
What the hell is Harrison
doing with Hannah?

132
00:08:23,865 --> 00:08:26,133
Deputy marshal
pulled off the detail.

133
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:28,502
It's not safe for Harrison
to be at the apartment

134
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:30,104
as long as Saxon's
still out there.

135
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:32,006
Okay, then I'll watch him,
but he shouldn't be with her.

136
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,008
That's not fuckin' fair to him.

137
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:35,363
Deb, I have to
tell you something.

138
00:08:35,377 --> 00:08:37,378
What?

139
00:08:37,412 --> 00:08:40,014
Harrison and I are
leaving soon.

140
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:41,816
What do you mean
you're leaving?

141
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,618
- You're leaving where?
- Leaving Miami...

142
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:47,655
with Hannah.

143
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:48,689
What are you talking about?

144
00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:52,493
We're moving to Argentina.

145
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:54,862
Are you kidding?

146
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:56,797
You know how stupid
that sounds?

147
00:08:56,832 --> 00:08:58,032
Deb--

148
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:59,500
You're gonna take
your fuckin' son,

149
00:08:59,534 --> 00:09:01,736
move to another country
with a wanted fugitive?

150
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,404
Have you fuckin'
thought this through?

151
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:05,973
Deb, I have.

152
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:09,110
We want to have
a life together.

153
00:09:09,144 --> 00:09:11,512
I wish there was a different
way, but there's not.

154
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:14,815
We need to leave the country,
start someplace new.

155
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:22,323
You act like this
doesn't even affect me.

156
00:09:22,357 --> 00:09:25,292
I know it does.

157
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:30,064
Well, then, that's a really
selfish decision on your part.

158
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:31,565
We'll still see each other.

159
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,403
I'll...come up here,
and you can visit.

160
00:09:35,437 --> 00:09:38,873
Okay, I'll look you up
the next time I'm in Argentina.

161
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:41,709
Deb, I'm sorry.

162
00:09:41,743 --> 00:09:44,745
This is hard for me too.

163
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:53,621
- Hey. How was your day?
- Long.

164
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:55,856
Aww.

165
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:57,691
Well, I had a really good day.

166
00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:00,561
Not only am I about
to graduate,

167
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:05,833
but I got a recruitment letter
from Greenwood Academy.

168
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:08,536
- A therapist position.
- What's Greenwood Academy?

169
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,006
It's a very well respected
special-needs school in Atlanta.

170
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,274
They want to set up
an interview.

171
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:15,576
That's fuckin' great.
When you going?

172
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,845
I'm not.

173
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:20,381
What do you mean?
Why not?

174
00:10:21,883 --> 00:10:24,351
Joey, I'm not moving
to Atlanta when you're here.

175
00:10:24,386 --> 00:10:25,820
I'll find something in Miami.

176
00:10:25,854 --> 00:10:29,557
I'm just so flattered
that they're interested.

177
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:32,560
Jamie, I-I would feel
like shit

178
00:10:32,594 --> 00:10:33,894
if I was the cause
of you missing out

179
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:35,162
on a great opportunity.

180
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:39,567
You shouldn't.
This is my decision.

181
00:10:41,636 --> 00:10:43,170
All I'm saying is, you know,

182
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:44,772
you should do what's best
for your career.

183
00:10:44,806 --> 00:10:47,842
What about us?

184
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:50,277
Don't worry about us, you know?

185
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:53,380
We'll...make it work.

186
00:10:53,415 --> 00:10:56,083
Be right back.
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

187
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:08,429
- Evelyn.
- Tom.

188
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:11,298
Please.

189
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,633
Everything okay?

190
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,735
Yes, fine.

191
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:16,537
A little over-worked, so...

192
00:11:16,571 --> 00:11:19,039
Mm. Thanks for coming in
this morning.

193
00:11:19,074 --> 00:11:21,942
As I said, it's kind
of a sensitive matter.

194
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:24,078
It's about one
of your patients.

195
00:11:24,112 --> 00:11:25,579
Zach Hamilton.

196
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:27,181
As I'm sure you're aware,
he's gone missing.

197
00:11:27,215 --> 00:11:29,950
Yes. I was hoping he'd
turned up by now.

198
00:11:29,985 --> 00:11:31,585
He hasn't.
And I promised his parents

199
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,588
that I would look into it
personally.

200
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:35,789
But I'm afraid I've hit
a dead end.

201
00:11:35,824 --> 00:11:37,391
Tom, you know that
I'm not at liberty

202
00:11:37,425 --> 00:11:38,526
to discuss my patients.

203
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,628
Come on, Evelyn,

204
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:42,763
I'm trying to help this kid.

205
00:11:42,797 --> 00:11:44,532
Now, he lived at home.

206
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:46,967
How was his relationship
with his parents?

207
00:11:47,002 --> 00:11:48,536
Like anyone his age.

208
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,604
Did he say anything
about trying to get away?

209
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,440
He talk about any friends,
maybe a special girl?

210
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:57,077
Was he into drugs?
Gambling?

211
00:11:57,112 --> 00:11:59,613
- Was he suicidal?
- I don't know.

212
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:02,616
Look, I know you understand
better than anyone

213
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:03,918
what it's like to lose a child.

214
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:07,254
Not knowing is even worse.

215
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:09,623
Imagine how the Hamiltons
must feel.

216
00:12:09,658 --> 00:12:14,328
I wish I could help,
but I just don't know anymore.

217
00:12:14,362 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry, but I have
another appointment.

218
00:12:27,842 --> 00:12:30,945
Saxon killed his brother
when he was only 14.

219
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:34,481
Killed seven more in the fire
when he was 17.

220
00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:37,651
How many more since then?

221
00:12:37,686 --> 00:12:40,321
He's lived in a dozen cities
across two continents.

222
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:44,658
Never been arrested.
Never leaves a trace.

223
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:49,296
Is he the perfect psychopath
I once was?

224
00:12:53,635 --> 00:12:56,036
- Dr. Vogel.
- Dexter.

225
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:58,472
Can we talk?

226
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:03,677
What are you doing here?

227
00:13:03,712 --> 00:13:06,680
Tom wanted to question me
about Zach.

228
00:13:06,715 --> 00:13:08,449
Well, of course,
I couldn't tell him anything.

229
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:11,051
But I feel horrid

230
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:13,153
keeping Zach's death
from the Hamiltons.

231
00:13:13,188 --> 00:13:17,558
And we both know that Zach's
killer is still out there.

232
00:13:17,592 --> 00:13:20,661
Understand, Evelyn,
you are in danger.

233
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:24,698
Well, you don't have to worry.

234
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:27,234
My son isn't gonna harm me.

235
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:31,338
- How do you know that?
- I just do.

236
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:34,375
Have you been
in contact with him?

237
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:36,510
I saw him.

238
00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:40,581
When?

239
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:45,319
We had breakfast yesterday.

240
00:13:45,353 --> 00:13:46,553
Where is he now?

241
00:13:46,588 --> 00:13:48,255
I have no idea.

242
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,224
- Evelyn...
- It's the truth.

243
00:13:50,258 --> 00:13:53,027
He--he was angry and he
stormed out of the house.

244
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:56,764
I don't know whether I'll
ever see him again.

245
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:00,768
Why didn't you tell me?

246
00:14:00,802 --> 00:14:03,904
Because you want to kill him.

247
00:14:03,938 --> 00:14:07,341
And I don't want that
to happen.

248
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,843
I can't turn my back
on him again.

249
00:14:09,878 --> 00:14:12,046
What is there you <i>can</i>
do for him?

250
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:18,085
Well...

251
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:22,756
first, I can establish trust.

252
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,759
I wasn't a good mother to him
when he was a child.

253
00:14:25,794 --> 00:14:29,029
I need to win him over.

254
00:14:29,064 --> 00:14:34,168
And then...
well, eventually, hopefully...

255
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:35,703
I'll get him back
into a facility.

256
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:39,039
And how many more
innocent people will he kill

257
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:41,108
before you do that,
before he kills you?

258
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:42,976
If you won't protect yourself,

259
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:46,113
I need to do it.

260
00:14:46,147 --> 00:14:47,881
I don't want you
to protect me, Dexter.

261
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,217
I don't want you to be a hero.

262
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:51,885
- Evelyn, I have to--
- Please!

263
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,988
Don't use me as an excuse
for killing Daniel.

264
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:08,235
She doesn't want my help.

265
00:15:09,838 --> 00:15:11,805
So do I just walk away
from this?

266
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,774
We could leave
for Argentina tonight.

267
00:15:13,808 --> 00:15:15,843
Dexter, you don't want
to leave this unfinished.

268
00:15:15,877 --> 00:15:17,644
I don't even know
how to find him.

269
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,847
You always find a way.

270
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:24,618
If you don't kill Saxon,
her life is at risk.

271
00:15:26,588 --> 00:15:27,988
Crime scene.

272
00:15:32,427 --> 00:15:37,865
You can send it back, you know.

273
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:40,300
It's not the salad.

274
00:15:40,335 --> 00:15:46,039
So you asked me here
to watch me eat?

275
00:15:46,074 --> 00:15:49,977
You can't tell
anybody this, okay?

276
00:15:53,515 --> 00:15:54,815
Dexter is leaving Miami.

277
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:56,550
Why?
He's quitting?

278
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:57,885
He and Harrison are gonna
take the rest of the year

279
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,186
and travel.

280
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,757
Fuckin'-a.
Good for him...or not.

281
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:06,393
I don't know if he's ever
coming back, you know.

282
00:16:06,428 --> 00:16:08,695
I mean, I get wanting
a change, but--

283
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,399
Sometimes, you know,
when things don't feel right,

284
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:15,369
changing it up is better
for everyone involved.

285
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:18,071
Not better for me.

286
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:19,907
He's my brother.
I don't want him to leave.

287
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:22,709
I understand, but maybe
you should think about

288
00:16:22,744 --> 00:16:24,111
what's best for him.

289
00:16:24,145 --> 00:16:27,581
Look, when I left New York,

290
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:29,216
it was one toughest things
I ever did,

291
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,318
leaving my friends and family.

292
00:16:31,352 --> 00:16:33,921
But as it turns out,
finally being on my own

293
00:16:33,955 --> 00:16:35,556
was the best thing
I ever did for myself.

294
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:46,533
Batista gave me my badge back.

295
00:16:46,568 --> 00:16:48,068
Fuckin'-a, that's great.

296
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:53,240
Or not.

297
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:54,575
It's good. It's good.

298
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:58,111
I've wanted to come back
for a long time.

299
00:16:58,146 --> 00:16:59,213
You tell Elway?

300
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:01,748
Not yet.

301
00:17:01,783 --> 00:17:03,250
You know what
this means, right?

302
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:06,386
You and me, side by side.

303
00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:11,258
Just like old times.

304
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:16,663
Seriously?

305
00:17:16,698 --> 00:17:18,565
It's a crime scene.
Gotta go.

306
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,800
No, I got it, I got it.

307
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:23,770
Okay.
Next one's on me...partner.

308
00:17:32,313 --> 00:17:34,448
Nothing will change
after I'm gone.

309
00:17:34,482 --> 00:17:36,683
Blood will continue to pool,

310
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:41,755
I just won't be here
to photograph it.

311
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:43,757
The guy was hit pretty hard.

312
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:47,094
Major head wounds,
lots of broken bones,

313
00:17:47,128 --> 00:17:48,328
internal injuries.

314
00:17:48,363 --> 00:17:49,730
Road rage.

315
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:51,724
The guy on the bike wouldn't
get out of the way,

316
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:54,701
gave him the finger,
so the driver ran him over.

317
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:55,936
Lieutenant, can I get a word?

318
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,005
Sure.

319
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,940
Hey, Dex.

320
00:17:59,974 --> 00:18:01,341
I didn't know
I had to work today.

321
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:04,444
Why would you think that?

322
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:08,048
Because it's Saturday.

323
00:18:08,948 --> 00:18:10,385
Are you high?

324
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,589
You're high, aren't you?
I can smell it on you.

325
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,356
Go home.

326
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:18,089
- Dad...
- We'll talk about this later.

327
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,056
Go!
And stop smoking pot.

328
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,389
You have every right
to tell me what to do at work,

329
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:26,322
but you have no right
to tell me what to do at home.

330
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:31,156
Well, that's... that's...
that's a huge shock, Dexter.

331
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:33,089
I know it seems like
it's out of the blue,

332
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,740
but after Rita's death...

333
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:38,485
And with the job,

334
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:42,597
I've just had enough death
in my life for a while.

335
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:48,356
I need a break, so...
this is my notice.

336
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:50,957
You need this, don't you?

337
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:56,345
I wish you nothing
but the best.

338
00:18:56,465 --> 00:18:57,373
Thank you.

339
00:18:57,493 --> 00:18:59,367
I'd like
to keep this between us.

340
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:04,189
I'd like to let other people
know myself, Jamie included.

341
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,522
She's gonna take it hard.

342
00:19:06,523 --> 00:19:07,856
You know,
she really loves Harrison.

343
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:09,305
He loves her too.

344
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:13,156
Anyway, she's moving on
herself.

345
00:19:13,157 --> 00:19:14,889
New job soon.

346
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,757
Maybe this'll make it easier.

347
00:19:20,157 --> 00:19:22,957
I'll miss you, bro.

348
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:31,630
Hey, listen,
if you change your mind,

349
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:34,289
you always have a home here.

350
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,357
Got it.

351
00:19:45,408 --> 00:19:48,489
He said, "I'm too big for a nap,"
and then he went right to sleep.

352
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,638
Cute.

353
00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:56,156
So are you any closer
in your search for Saxon?

354
00:19:56,157 --> 00:19:58,489
Not really.

355
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,431
I don't know much about him.

356
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:00,988
He moves around a lot.

357
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,156
I guess he figures if you stay
in one place too long...

358
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:07,457
Eventually you get caught.

359
00:20:09,004 --> 00:20:11,522
I wish we could just leave.

360
00:20:11,523 --> 00:20:13,894
Yeah, me too, but I know

361
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:16,705
that you have
to protect Dr. Vogel.

362
00:20:19,272 --> 00:20:21,922
Actually,
she doesn't want me to.

363
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:23,957
Then why are you doing this?

364
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,211
Because it's what I do.

365
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:32,156
It's... who I am.
It's all I know.

366
00:20:32,157 --> 00:20:33,957
Dexter, you're more than that.

367
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:39,522
Am I?

368
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:43,222
You think that when
we move to Argentina

369
00:20:43,223 --> 00:20:46,503
that... it's possible
for you and me

370
00:20:46,623 --> 00:20:48,063
to have a fresh start?

371
00:20:49,243 --> 00:20:50,617
Yes.

372
00:20:50,737 --> 00:20:52,524
Well, then, the sooner
you kill Saxon,

373
00:20:52,644 --> 00:20:54,332
the sooner we can get there.

374
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:03,222
Vogel is the key.
I'm sure he'll go for her.

375
00:21:03,223 --> 00:21:06,922
But I can't just sit
and watch her.

376
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:09,463
Especially if she figures out
that you're watching her.

377
00:21:09,797 --> 00:21:11,654
That can make things worse.

378
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:15,457
I need to find him, but
maybe I don't need Vogel.

379
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:18,238
Just her computer.

380
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:40,823
I want you to see something.
Get in.

381
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,290
I'm not gonna hurt you...
Mom.

382
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,113
Trust me, if I wanted you dead,

383
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:51,008
I wouldn't be holding
this door.

384
00:22:27,157 --> 00:22:31,490
Do you recognize this
from the video I sent you?

385
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,390
This is where you kill
your victims.

386
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:44,656
Why did you bring me here?

387
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:46,422
To help you understand.

388
00:22:46,423 --> 00:22:49,557
Have a seat.

389
00:22:51,857 --> 00:22:56,522
Don't worry, I wiped it
down after every, uh...

390
00:22:56,845 --> 00:22:58,622
Well...

391
00:23:07,114 --> 00:23:09,765
This room is more than
what you think it is.

392
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,326
It's a reminder.

393
00:23:15,212 --> 00:23:18,331
Of what?

394
00:23:18,451 --> 00:23:21,010
Of where you sent me.

395
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,394
I've made it look exactly like

396
00:23:25,514 --> 00:23:27,789
what they called
our "treatment" room.

397
00:23:32,173 --> 00:23:34,040
When I would refuse
to take my meds,

398
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:37,439
the doctors would strap me down
into a chair like this...

399
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:43,984
and they would force
the meds down.

400
00:23:44,018 --> 00:23:47,677
And that was usually
the highlight of my day.

401
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,329
You can see why
I caused that fire.

402
00:23:55,747 --> 00:23:58,197
I can see why you'd do anything

403
00:23:58,317 --> 00:24:00,645
to get out
of a place like this.

404
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,308
You said before
that you wanted to help me.

405
00:24:09,513 --> 00:24:10,900
Yes.

406
00:24:11,755 --> 00:24:12,547
I'd like that.

407
00:24:13,092 --> 00:24:15,111
Most facilities aren't like this, Daniel.

408
00:24:15,507 --> 00:24:18,679
I could put you someplace where

409
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,614
you'd be very comfortable...
I could see you every day.

410
00:24:21,854 --> 00:24:23,970
I want you to help me
like you helped Dexter.

411
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,264
I want you to show me how
to exist free in the world

412
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:29,987
just the way I am.

413
00:24:30,107 --> 00:24:31,877
Yes, I can.

414
00:24:34,257 --> 00:24:37,569
Daniel, I can't help you
to murder innocent people.

415
00:24:39,714 --> 00:24:40,872
If you care about me,

416
00:24:40,906 --> 00:24:42,750
the way you say you do,

417
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,118
you'll figure out a way to make this work.

418
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,754
I wanna be someone you can love.

419
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,578
I'm asking you as your son...

420
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,925
please help me.

421
00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:17,589
All right, I'll find a way.

422
00:25:18,257 --> 00:25:19,777
What about Dexter?
He's still after me.

423
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:21,203
I'll talk to Dexter.

424
00:25:23,358 --> 00:25:25,637
Don't make the same mistake
you made with Richard.

425
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:29,875
Choose right this time.

426
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,948
Choose me.

427
00:25:34,595 --> 00:25:36,428
I'll get Dexter to understand.

428
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:37,716
Do you think that's possible?

429
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:38,816
I'll make it possible.

430
00:25:41,002 --> 00:25:42,525
I want this, Daniel.

431
00:25:42,884 --> 00:25:44,902
I want to be your mother again.

432
00:25:46,118 --> 00:25:47,905
I'll do whatever it takes.

433
00:26:08,714 --> 00:26:12,429
Vogel told me where she keeps a
spare key in case of an emergency.

434
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:15,970
I think protecting her
from her deranged son qualifies.

435
00:26:22,513 --> 00:26:27,713
Saxon installed spyware
on her computer.

436
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:30,295
Thing is, that can go
both ways.

437
00:26:30,415 --> 00:26:33,440
So if Saxon can see
Vogel's computer...

438
00:26:33,984 --> 00:26:37,612
then I can see Saxon's.

439
00:26:38,203 --> 00:26:40,017
So what are you looking for?

440
00:26:40,137 --> 00:26:45,686
Something, anything
that can give me an edge.

441
00:26:50,957 --> 00:26:52,424
What's this?

442
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:58,264
That's the video
he sent to Vogel.

443
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,838
And this one's from last week.

444
00:27:05,872 --> 00:27:09,141
- No, don't!
- Zach.

445
00:27:09,175 --> 00:27:10,910
No, no!
What are you doing? No!

446
00:27:23,557 --> 00:27:26,525
Dexter, if something happens
to Evelyn,

447
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,927
it will haunt you forever.

448
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:29,862
You can't just
run off to Argentina

449
00:27:29,896 --> 00:27:31,244
and escape who you are.

450
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,454
I'm not trying
to escape anything.

451
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:41,540
So you'll post
a job listing next week?

452
00:27:41,575 --> 00:27:45,477
Great. Listen, I just don't
need any forensic tech.

453
00:27:45,512 --> 00:27:48,347
I need the best out there.
He's filling some big shoes.

454
00:27:48,381 --> 00:27:50,649
I appreciate it.

455
00:27:50,684 --> 00:27:52,284
Sorry, deputy.
How can I help you?

456
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,719
Just came by to let you know
none of our leads

457
00:27:53,753 --> 00:27:55,888
on Hannah McKay panned out.

458
00:27:55,922 --> 00:27:57,890
You know, when the trail
goes cold at this point,

459
00:27:57,924 --> 00:27:58,891
the subject either
was never here,

460
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:00,993
or skipped town pretty fast.

461
00:28:01,027 --> 00:28:02,361
What does that mean?

462
00:28:02,395 --> 00:28:03,896
It means the case is back
to low priority.

463
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,631
All right.
Thanks for the heads up.

464
00:28:05,665 --> 00:28:07,633
I couldn't help overhearing.

465
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:09,969
You said you're looking
for a new forensic tech.

466
00:28:10,003 --> 00:28:12,471
- You know someone?
- No, I'm just curious--

467
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:14,740
Who's leaving?
It's not Dexter Morgan, is it?

468
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:16,375
Close the door.

469
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:21,347
He hasn't told any
of his friends yet,

470
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:24,383
so this is on the QT,
but yes, Dexter's moving on.

471
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:26,218
Oh, he got a better job, huh?

472
00:28:26,252 --> 00:28:28,487
No, he's going to travel,
spend time with his son.

473
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:33,359
- Really?
- Yeah. I can't say I blame him.

474
00:28:38,531 --> 00:28:42,267
Hey, babe.
How was your day?

475
00:28:42,302 --> 00:28:45,904
Okay.
You working?

476
00:28:45,939 --> 00:28:47,906
Yeah, I'm just
sending out resumes.

477
00:28:47,941 --> 00:28:51,343
I'm almost done though.

478
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:59,051
Hey, um...
can we talk for a sec?

479
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:01,320
Okay.

480
00:29:01,354 --> 00:29:03,822
I feel like an asshole,
but I gotta be honest with you.

481
00:29:03,857 --> 00:29:08,227
Okay, so...
be honest.

482
00:29:08,261 --> 00:29:11,397
It's not working out
between us, is it?

483
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:19,204
- Is that a question?
- No.

484
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:21,740
It's--
I'm sorry.

485
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:28,781
Then why did you let me
move in here?

486
00:29:28,815 --> 00:29:30,349
I mean, why wait until now,
Joey?

487
00:29:30,383 --> 00:29:34,253
I hoped it would
make things better.

488
00:29:34,287 --> 00:29:35,888
I don't know what else to say.

489
00:29:35,922 --> 00:29:39,425
Ugh, I am so stupid to think
you would ever get over Deb.

490
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:41,694
It's got nothing
to do with Deb.

491
00:29:41,728 --> 00:29:44,596
I thought you wanted
to be honest with me.

492
00:29:44,631 --> 00:29:47,032
I am.
This is on me.

493
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:49,101
She's got nothing
to do with it.

494
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:51,804
Joey, see, that is
what hurts the most.

495
00:29:51,838 --> 00:29:55,607
You just keep lying about it.

496
00:29:55,642 --> 00:29:57,710
I'm not lying, Jamie.

497
00:29:57,744 --> 00:29:59,244
Okay, you know what?
Don't worry.

498
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,147
I'm gonna move my stuff
outta here as soon as I can,

499
00:30:02,182 --> 00:30:04,216
so you're free to <i>not</i>
go back to Deb.

500
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,218
Jamie--

501
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:08,287
Bye.

502
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,463
Hey.

503
00:30:55,869 --> 00:30:58,470
- I don't want to intrude.
- Well, it's your house.

504
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:05,310
It's your family.

505
00:31:08,948 --> 00:31:12,684
It's your family too.

506
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:23,362
I want you and Harrison
to be happy.

507
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:28,000
So...how do you feel
about us leaving?

508
00:31:31,104 --> 00:31:33,972
Scared.

509
00:31:34,007 --> 00:31:38,043
My whole family's moving.

510
00:31:38,077 --> 00:31:41,380
Scared?

511
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:48,053
You've always been there.

512
00:31:48,087 --> 00:31:50,489
I don't know what my life
looks like without you.

513
00:31:50,523 --> 00:31:55,060
Well, maybe it looks better.

514
00:31:55,094 --> 00:31:57,796
Really?

515
00:31:57,831 --> 00:32:00,098
Hanging out
with two serial killers--

516
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:01,700
does it get better than that?

517
00:32:01,734 --> 00:32:03,502
So you see my point.

518
00:32:08,675 --> 00:32:11,210
I don't know.

519
00:32:11,244 --> 00:32:16,081
Better or worse...

520
00:32:16,115 --> 00:32:18,884
you've always been there.

521
00:32:18,918 --> 00:32:23,255
Moving on without you
feels like jumping off a cliff.

522
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:26,558
I know what you mean.

523
00:32:33,633 --> 00:32:35,567
What?

524
00:32:39,072 --> 00:32:40,339
Will you?

525
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:55,387
Hey, look who's here.

526
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:14,840
Hi.

527
00:33:14,874 --> 00:33:18,343
- Hi. Just checking in.
- All is well here.

528
00:33:18,378 --> 00:33:20,445
Harrison's playing outside
with Deb.

529
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,483
- Oh, good.
- You doing okay?

530
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:27,286
Yeah, I just wanted
to hear your voice.

531
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:35,093
I have to go.

532
00:33:37,964 --> 00:33:39,431
- Evelyn.
- Dexter.

533
00:33:39,465 --> 00:33:41,233
I was hoping we could talk.

534
00:33:41,267 --> 00:33:44,636
Okay.

535
00:33:44,671 --> 00:33:46,171
I've been rethinking
what I said earlier,

536
00:33:46,205 --> 00:33:49,641
and I fear I was being
too judgmental.

537
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:51,277
I think it's possible that
you and Hannah

538
00:33:51,311 --> 00:33:52,878
could have a relationship.

539
00:33:52,912 --> 00:33:56,481
- Really?
- And I think moving far away,

540
00:33:56,516 --> 00:33:59,718
beginning anew might be
the best thing for you.

541
00:33:59,752 --> 00:34:03,388
Moving far away?
Is that the important part?

542
00:34:03,423 --> 00:34:07,426
You mentioned Argentina?
That could be a good place.

543
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,027
Why do you want me to leave?

544
00:34:09,062 --> 00:34:13,231
Dexter, I think
there's hope for Daniel.

545
00:34:13,266 --> 00:34:15,901
I don't think he likes killing.

546
00:34:15,935 --> 00:34:17,703
I could help him,

547
00:34:17,737 --> 00:34:22,341
but I'm not going to get
that chance if you kill him.

548
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:25,677
So just leave, please.
Leave Miami.

549
00:34:25,712 --> 00:34:27,079
You don't think
he likes killing?

550
00:34:27,113 --> 00:34:28,246
He says he wants my help.

551
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:29,614
Let me show you how much

552
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:31,750
he doesn't like killing.

553
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:41,393
No, don't--aah!

554
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:42,961
No...

555
00:34:42,996 --> 00:34:47,132
That's Zach's head
he's sawing into.

556
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,434
Oh...

557
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:52,971
There's no hope
for him, Evelyn.

558
00:34:53,006 --> 00:34:55,974
This is the same person
who killed your younger son.

559
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:57,809
He will never change.

560
00:34:57,844 --> 00:35:01,246
I'm sorry.

561
00:35:17,363 --> 00:35:18,997
So what now?

562
00:35:19,032 --> 00:35:21,500
You know what needs to happen.

563
00:35:21,534 --> 00:35:26,071
Otherwise, he'll go on killing.

564
00:35:29,142 --> 00:35:30,308
Where is he now?

565
00:35:30,343 --> 00:35:33,645
He said he would
call me tonight.

566
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:36,882
Set up a meeting
with him tonight.

567
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:40,385
Someplace public...safe.

568
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,921
Call me and let me know where.

569
00:35:42,955 --> 00:35:46,591
I'll follow him
and take it from there.

570
00:35:56,269 --> 00:35:59,504
Just please don't
let him suffer.

571
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:00,872
I won't.

572
00:36:14,987 --> 00:36:17,956
Debra Morgan.

573
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,324
Do I know you?

574
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:21,827
Deputy U.S. Marshal
Max Clayton.

575
00:36:21,861 --> 00:36:22,961
And this is Harrison.

576
00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:24,930
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi.

577
00:36:24,964 --> 00:36:28,533
You guys have met?
Over at his dad's, yeah.

578
00:36:28,568 --> 00:36:30,602
Harrison, why don't you
go inside.

579
00:36:30,636 --> 00:36:34,773
- I'll be there in a minute.
- Okay.

580
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,511
Elway gave me your address.

581
00:36:39,545 --> 00:36:40,679
I thought it better
we talk in person.

582
00:36:40,713 --> 00:36:43,982
Okay.

583
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:45,550
Look, I'm worried
about your brother.

584
00:36:45,585 --> 00:36:47,519
Dexter? Why?

585
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:49,855
It's probably nothing,

586
00:36:49,889 --> 00:36:51,823
but it just struck me as odd

587
00:36:51,858 --> 00:36:54,759
that he's leaving town
at the exact time

588
00:36:54,794 --> 00:36:57,062
Hannah McKay is rumored
to be here.

589
00:36:57,096 --> 00:36:58,363
How do you know he's leaving?

590
00:36:58,397 --> 00:37:00,332
Uh, overheard at the station.

591
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:03,201
Maybe it's nothing, but...

592
00:37:03,236 --> 00:37:06,505
are he and Arlene Shram
a couple?

593
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:08,240
I don't know. I don't keep up
with his dating life.

594
00:37:08,274 --> 00:37:10,475
Okay, it's just I know
he used to have a relationship

595
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,843
with Hannah McKay.

596
00:37:11,878 --> 00:37:14,713
What if he still does?

597
00:37:14,747 --> 00:37:16,448
- Then he's a fuckin' idiot.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

598
00:37:16,482 --> 00:37:18,583
I know I'm going out
on a limb here,

599
00:37:18,618 --> 00:37:22,387
but what if these two
somehow reconnected?

600
00:37:22,421 --> 00:37:23,855
I mean, his life
could be at risk.

601
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,024
- His son's too.
- Dexter wouldn't do that.

602
00:37:26,058 --> 00:37:27,626
I hope not.

603
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,094
I don't need to tell you
what a dangerous person

604
00:37:29,128 --> 00:37:30,362
Hannah McKay is.

605
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:31,763
You know more about her
than I do.

606
00:37:31,797 --> 00:37:33,098
If Dexter were dating
Hannah McKay,

607
00:37:33,132 --> 00:37:34,566
I would fuckin' know about it.

608
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,368
Maybe he'd keep it from you.
Who knows?

609
00:37:36,402 --> 00:37:39,104
I mean, men do stupid things
for beautiful women.

610
00:37:39,138 --> 00:37:41,106
Logic just flies
out the window.

611
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,974
Well, I appreciate
your concern,

612
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:45,644
but that's not
what's happening here.

613
00:37:45,678 --> 00:37:47,646
Dexter's burned out,
that's why he's leaving.

614
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,115
Okay. Thank you.

615
00:37:50,149 --> 00:37:52,417
I respect your opinion.
Here's my card.

616
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:53,652
Call me if you think
of anything.

617
00:37:53,686 --> 00:37:56,922
Okay, will do.

618
00:38:08,968 --> 00:38:11,102
Hey.
You guys hungry?

619
00:38:11,137 --> 00:38:15,373
- Yeah!
- Hey, go clean up, Harrison.

620
00:38:18,878 --> 00:38:19,911
Is everything okay?

621
00:38:19,946 --> 00:38:22,113
Not really.

622
00:38:22,148 --> 00:38:23,682
Something happen?

623
00:38:23,716 --> 00:38:25,517
Deputy Marshal Clayton
happened.

624
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:27,619
He was just questioning me
on the beach.

625
00:38:27,653 --> 00:38:30,488
I thought that Dexter said
that Clayton was backing off.

626
00:38:30,523 --> 00:38:31,890
Somehow he found out
that Dexter's leaving,

627
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:33,409
and it tweaked him.

628
00:38:33,529 --> 00:38:35,160
He thinks Dexter's
helping you hide.

629
00:38:35,194 --> 00:38:36,294
Oh, God.

630
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:37,629
I covered for both of you,

631
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:39,397
but you have got
to stay hidden until you leave.

632
00:38:39,432 --> 00:38:41,700
Of course. Yes.

633
00:38:41,734 --> 00:38:44,402
Oh...

634
00:38:44,437 --> 00:38:47,772
thank you for protecting me...
again.

635
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:53,378
Who knew I'd be so good at it?

636
00:38:53,412 --> 00:38:54,813
We'll all be out of here soon.

637
00:38:54,847 --> 00:38:55,814
I know.

638
00:38:55,848 --> 00:39:00,252
- I-I have lunch.
- No, thanks.

639
00:39:00,286 --> 00:39:02,420
I have someplace I need to be.

640
00:39:12,498 --> 00:39:16,301
- Hey.
- Hey.

641
00:39:16,335 --> 00:39:18,737
- Can we talk?
- Nothing to talk about.

642
00:39:18,771 --> 00:39:20,639
I know why you're here.
I'll have your last check drawn.

643
00:39:20,673 --> 00:39:22,007
I was gonna give you two weeks.

644
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,608
Don't want your two weeks.
I still have friends

645
00:39:23,643 --> 00:39:25,176
in Miami Metro, they said
you were going back.

646
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:26,811
Well, shouldn't we talk
about this?

647
00:39:26,846 --> 00:39:28,980
I went out of my way
to make this work.

648
00:39:29,015 --> 00:39:30,682
I put up with your bullshit.

649
00:39:30,716 --> 00:39:33,084
The more I gave,
the more you pushed back.

650
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,199
It's quite clear to me
you were never gonna work out.

651
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:40,292
Well, I'm sorry.

652
00:39:40,326 --> 00:39:43,061
I really appreciate the job...

653
00:39:43,095 --> 00:39:44,729
and everything
that you've done for me.

654
00:39:44,764 --> 00:39:47,265
Don't mention it.

655
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:51,936
Let--let's just, uh...

656
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:55,106
Okay.

657
00:39:55,141 --> 00:39:56,408
I'm gonna go pack up my office.

658
00:39:56,442 --> 00:39:57,609
I'll have security do that.

659
00:39:57,643 --> 00:39:59,377
They'll deliver it
to your house.

660
00:39:59,412 --> 00:40:01,813
And all the case files
are mine, of course.

661
00:40:01,847 --> 00:40:05,116
Including those
on Hannah McKay.

662
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:10,255
- Good luck to you.
- Yeah, you too.

663
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:14,659
Harrison, remember
what your dad said.

664
00:40:14,694 --> 00:40:15,960
That's not a toy.

665
00:40:15,995 --> 00:40:18,330
But Aunt Deb does it
all the time.

666
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:23,435
Harrison, please listen.

667
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:25,603
I am.

668
00:40:32,878 --> 00:40:35,847
Ow!

669
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:39,851
Harrison!

670
00:40:39,885 --> 00:40:44,155
- Ow! Ow!
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.

671
00:40:46,158 --> 00:40:47,325
- Ow.
- I know it hurts.

672
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,295
I know it hurts.
It's gonna be okay.

673
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:52,964
Ow. Ow...

674
00:40:52,998 --> 00:40:57,702
- Here, hold that.
- Ow.

675
00:40:59,405 --> 00:41:01,172
Dexter Morgan.

676
00:41:01,207 --> 00:41:05,810
Dexter, call me.

677
00:41:05,845 --> 00:41:07,045
We're gonna have to
take you somewhere

678
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,681
and get you patched up.

679
00:41:14,987 --> 00:41:17,021
- What happened?
- He fell and hit his chin.

680
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,857
It's a pretty deep cut.
It won't stop bleeding.

681
00:41:18,891 --> 00:41:20,792
I'll let the doctor know.
Are you the mother?

682
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:23,561
- Are you the mother?
- Uh, yes.

683
00:41:23,596 --> 00:41:26,331
I'm just waiting for his father
to call me back.

684
00:41:26,365 --> 00:41:27,565
- Fill this out.
- Okay.

685
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,434
And wait for us
to call his name.

686
00:41:29,468 --> 00:41:30,769
Okay.
Thank you.

687
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,008
Harrison,
you're being so brave.

688
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:41,846
I can't wait to tell your dad.

689
00:42:05,237 --> 00:42:06,504
Harrison Morgan?

690
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:08,706
Uh, yeah.

691
00:42:08,741 --> 00:42:11,142
Here.

692
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:28,226
Been a while
since we've been here.

693
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,763
- Choir director.
- Long time ago.

694
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:40,038
Saxon's first victim.

695
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,063
And his last victims.

696
00:43:05,097 --> 00:43:08,333
It's also been a while since
you've used victims' pictures.

697
00:43:10,302 --> 00:43:12,637
He needs to see what he's done.

698
00:43:12,671 --> 00:43:15,740
That was always
very important to you.

699
00:43:15,774 --> 00:43:19,777
People get what they deserve.

700
00:43:19,812 --> 00:43:23,281
At least they should.

701
00:43:23,315 --> 00:43:25,917
I've come a long way.

702
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:27,685
It feels like
I'm a different person

703
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,922
from the last time
I was in third room.

704
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:32,290
You're still you, Dexter.

705
00:43:32,324 --> 00:43:33,992
I hope you realize that.

706
00:43:34,026 --> 00:43:36,794
Why wouldn't I?

707
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:39,931
I just don't want you to have
any unrealistic expectations

708
00:43:39,965 --> 00:43:41,666
about whatever happens next.

709
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:46,170
I know exactly
what happens next.

710
00:43:46,205 --> 00:43:48,540
I kill Saxon.

711
00:43:48,574 --> 00:43:50,742
And then Hannah
and Harrison and I

712
00:43:50,776 --> 00:43:53,845
get on a plane
and start our new lives.

713
00:44:04,924 --> 00:44:07,859
- Hey, Jamie.
- Go fuck yourself.

714
00:44:07,893 --> 00:44:11,129
- What?
- Debra, come on in.

715
00:44:16,201 --> 00:44:18,670
I'm ready to come back
if you'll have me.

716
00:44:18,704 --> 00:44:20,572
"If I'll have you"?

717
00:44:20,606 --> 00:44:22,173
Are you sure about this?

718
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:23,841
You're not fooling me?

719
00:44:23,876 --> 00:44:26,144
Uh, I don't think so.

720
00:44:26,178 --> 00:44:28,012
Well, in that case, hallelujah.

721
00:44:28,047 --> 00:44:29,781
Can you start today?

722
00:44:29,815 --> 00:44:32,850
I was thinking more like
a week or two.

723
00:44:32,885 --> 00:44:35,353
Of course.
Loose ends.

724
00:44:35,387 --> 00:44:38,456
Yeah, something like that.

725
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:41,125
Whenever you're ready,
I'm ready.

726
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,861
- It's funny, though.
- What?

727
00:44:43,896 --> 00:44:46,130
You coming back
as Dexter's leaving.

728
00:44:46,165 --> 00:44:48,299
- He told you?
- Yeah.

729
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:51,102
And don't worry about Jamie.

730
00:44:51,136 --> 00:44:53,605
- What was that?
- Oh, you don't know?

731
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:56,040
Quinn just ended things
with her--stupid idiot.

732
00:44:56,075 --> 00:44:57,508
- He did?
- And so, you know,

733
00:44:57,543 --> 00:44:59,143
Jamie kind of blames you.

734
00:44:59,178 --> 00:45:01,012
Yeah, I get that.

735
00:45:01,046 --> 00:45:02,413
Yeah, she thinks Quinn is
still in love with you

736
00:45:02,448 --> 00:45:03,615
or something like that.

737
00:45:03,649 --> 00:45:06,017
I didn't want to know
the details.

738
00:45:10,556 --> 00:45:13,858
I'll let you have at him first.

739
00:45:20,499 --> 00:45:21,833
We need to talk.

740
00:45:21,867 --> 00:45:25,169
- I just did what--
- Not here.

741
00:45:25,204 --> 00:45:28,072
Did you break up with her
because of me?

742
00:45:28,107 --> 00:45:31,009
No.
Yes.

743
00:45:31,043 --> 00:45:34,278
I mean, no and yes.
Don't get all mad.

744
00:45:34,313 --> 00:45:35,480
Your face gets all red
when you get mad.

745
00:45:35,514 --> 00:45:37,649
No, it doesn't.
What the fuck happened?

746
00:45:37,683 --> 00:45:41,519
It's not complicated.
I wasn't happy.

747
00:45:41,553 --> 00:45:44,055
I mean, I was okay,
but I kinda knew

748
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:45,223
I was never gonna marry her.

749
00:45:45,257 --> 00:45:47,358
Probably would have
ended it soon anyway,

750
00:45:47,393 --> 00:45:49,327
even if what happened
between you and I didn't happen.

751
00:45:49,361 --> 00:45:51,462
Nothing happened.
We shared a kiss.

752
00:45:51,497 --> 00:45:54,232
That's not a reason to fuckin'
break up with somebody.

753
00:45:54,266 --> 00:45:56,567
You're not hearing me.
I probably would have

754
00:45:56,602 --> 00:45:59,837
broke up with Jamie, but
what happened between you and I

755
00:45:59,872 --> 00:46:03,808
just made it clear that
I shouldn't be with her anymore.

756
00:46:03,842 --> 00:46:07,478
- Got it?
- Yes.

757
00:46:07,513 --> 00:46:11,416
So yeah, to be
completely honest,

758
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:14,052
I still have feelings for you,

759
00:46:14,086 --> 00:46:16,554
but I don't expect anything
from you.

760
00:46:16,588 --> 00:46:20,324
- Why not?
- I didn't think you wanted--

761
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:24,629
I still have feelings
for you, stupid.

762
00:46:24,663 --> 00:46:26,731
I didn't change, I just--

763
00:46:26,765 --> 00:46:30,201
I wasn't sure that I saw
a future for us.

764
00:46:30,235 --> 00:46:31,569
What about now?

765
00:46:31,603 --> 00:46:35,273
I don't know.
I mean, I used to--

766
00:46:35,307 --> 00:46:38,676
I used to feel like something
was holding me back, but now--

767
00:46:38,711 --> 00:46:41,679
now I just--shh!

768
00:46:48,954 --> 00:46:50,588
Are you sure it was
Hannah McKay

769
00:46:50,622 --> 00:46:51,789
- you saw earlier today?
- Yeah.

770
00:46:51,824 --> 00:46:53,104
I'd seen her picture
on the news.

771
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:55,426
She brought in her son.
He had a cut on his chin.

772
00:46:55,461 --> 00:46:57,128
Hannah McKay doesn't have
any children.

773
00:46:57,162 --> 00:46:59,964
- Are you sure this is her?
- Well, I think so.

774
00:46:59,998 --> 00:47:01,065
What was her boy's name?

775
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,568
His name was Harrison Morgan,

776
00:47:03,602 --> 00:47:06,137
and she sure acted
like he was her own.

777
00:47:12,845 --> 00:47:15,413
I fell on my chin.

778
00:47:15,447 --> 00:47:18,049
Yeah, how many stitches are
holding that chin together?

779
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:20,918
- Six.
- Wow. I bet that hurt.

780
00:47:20,953 --> 00:47:24,756
Yeah, but Harrison
was very brave.

781
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:27,158
I even got a lollipop.
Can I go play now?

782
00:47:27,192 --> 00:47:28,960
Yeah, sure.

783
00:47:31,864 --> 00:47:33,898
Thanks for taking care of him.

784
00:47:33,932 --> 00:47:36,400
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I feel awful.

785
00:47:36,435 --> 00:47:37,935
I can't believe
I wasn't here for you.

786
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:40,004
You went out in public.

787
00:47:40,038 --> 00:47:41,339
You put yourself in jeopardy

788
00:47:41,373 --> 00:47:43,174
because I was setting up
the kill room.

789
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:47,278
- Dex, you didn't know.
- It doesn't matter.

790
00:47:47,312 --> 00:47:49,347
I'm trying to save
Dr. Vogel

791
00:47:49,381 --> 00:47:51,115
when I should be taking care
of you and Harrison.

792
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:53,351
We're okay, really.
It's fine.

793
00:47:53,385 --> 00:47:56,754
- But there is one other thing.
- What?

794
00:47:56,789 --> 00:47:58,923
- That deputy marshal came by.
- Here?

795
00:47:58,957 --> 00:48:00,758
He talked to Deb. I think
she put him off, but still,

796
00:48:00,793 --> 00:48:02,760
we can't stay here
for much longer.

797
00:48:02,795 --> 00:48:04,729
I know.

798
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:09,667
Evelyn?

799
00:48:09,701 --> 00:48:12,303
Dexter, he's here.

800
00:48:12,337 --> 00:48:13,938
Here? Where's <i>here?</i>

801
00:48:13,972 --> 00:48:16,741
At my house.
He called me.

802
00:48:16,775 --> 00:48:18,609
Said he was a couple
of blocks away.

803
00:48:18,644 --> 00:48:20,144
No, that wasn't the plan.

804
00:48:20,179 --> 00:48:21,946
You were supposed to meet him
someplace in public.

805
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,347
Someplace safe.

806
00:48:23,382 --> 00:48:26,450
It's the last time
I'm ever going to see him.

807
00:48:26,485 --> 00:48:28,352
I wanted a private
good-bye.

808
00:48:28,387 --> 00:48:29,954
It's not a good idea.

809
00:48:32,224 --> 00:48:35,092
- That's him now.
- Evelyn?

810
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:40,965
What?

811
00:48:40,999 --> 00:48:43,100
I have to go.

812
00:48:43,135 --> 00:48:48,272
- Well, be careful.
- I will.

813
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,680
Dexter, go!

814
00:48:55,714 --> 00:48:57,181
What if the marshal comes back?

815
00:48:57,216 --> 00:48:58,449
He's not coming back.

816
00:48:58,483 --> 00:48:59,450
It's Evelyn who needs you
right now.

817
00:48:59,484 --> 00:49:01,452
I should stay here with Hannah.

818
00:49:01,486 --> 00:49:03,454
This is exactly
what Vogel warned you about.

819
00:49:03,488 --> 00:49:04,755
You're trying to live
in two different worlds,

820
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:06,023
and it's got you paralyzed.

821
00:49:06,058 --> 00:49:08,793
I'm not paralyzed.
I'm making a choice.

822
00:49:08,827 --> 00:49:11,896
Son, you're choosing
to be afraid,

823
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:13,231
because for the first time
in your life,

824
00:49:13,265 --> 00:49:15,032
you think you've got
something to lose.

825
00:49:15,067 --> 00:49:17,435
Is that who you want to be?

826
00:49:22,941 --> 00:49:25,910
Oh. That's all right.

827
00:49:27,346 --> 00:49:29,380
I'm getting old.

828
00:49:29,414 --> 00:49:32,316
My aim isn't as good
as it used to be.

829
00:49:36,588 --> 00:49:38,689
Why'd you want
to see me tonight?

830
00:49:43,695 --> 00:49:47,431
I just thought it would be
nice for us to talk...

831
00:49:47,466 --> 00:49:50,101
about normal things.

832
00:49:50,135 --> 00:49:51,602
Unlike the other couple
of times.

833
00:49:51,637 --> 00:49:54,071
Hmm. Of course.

834
00:50:00,612 --> 00:50:02,680
- What's wrong?
- Wrong?

835
00:50:02,714 --> 00:50:04,582
- You seem tense.
- No.

836
00:50:04,616 --> 00:50:08,019
No, not at all.
I'm very comfortable.

837
00:50:08,053 --> 00:50:12,189
Maybe a little tired...
under the circumstances.

838
00:50:17,896 --> 00:50:19,530
Is there something
you want to tell me?

839
00:50:24,169 --> 00:50:29,874
I just wanted to see you.

840
00:50:29,908 --> 00:50:31,642
Guess I'm sounding like

841
00:50:31,677 --> 00:50:34,879
a mother already...

842
00:50:34,913 --> 00:50:38,182
constantly wanting
her son around.

843
00:50:43,822 --> 00:50:46,057
You know...

844
00:50:46,091 --> 00:50:50,528
when you see as many people die
as I have,

845
00:50:50,562 --> 00:50:52,630
you know when they're afraid.

846
00:50:52,664 --> 00:50:55,933
What are you afraid of, mother?

847
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:07,578
He's still here.

848
00:51:07,612 --> 00:51:10,514
- Hello, Dexter.
- What do you want? Where--

849
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:13,117
Don't move.
I want to show you something.

850
00:51:16,989 --> 00:51:18,322
Don't touch her.

851
00:51:18,357 --> 00:51:21,292
Mother chose
the wrong son, again.

852
00:51:32,304 --> 00:51:34,271
Evelyn?

853
00:51:34,306 --> 00:51:36,140
Oh, no, no, no.

854
00:51:36,174 --> 00:51:39,677
No...

855
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:10,662
