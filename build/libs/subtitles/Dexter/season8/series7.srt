Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

4
00:01:49,217 --> 00:01:52,986
It's no accident
that Zach Hamilton is here.

5
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:54,855
He's drawn to blood,
like me.

6
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:57,791
And the arterial spurting here

7
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:00,394
indicates
that the killer severed

8
00:02:00,428 --> 00:02:02,829
the carotid artery
with the first stab.

9
00:02:02,864 --> 00:02:05,399
I'm promoting Miller
to sergeant.

10
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:06,567
Are you fucking
kidding me?

11
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:08,468
You actually made me
want this,

12
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,337
and now you're gonna
take it away.

13
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:13,106
I just did
a little research on you.

14
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:15,242
You checked into me...
Like a criminal.

15
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:17,210
Hey, Niki--

16
00:02:17,245 --> 00:02:19,079
- Dexter, this is Oliver.

17
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:20,747
Oliver, Dexter.
Nice to meet you.

18
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:24,251
Yeah, you too.

19
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:26,486
Zach Hamilton
killed Norma Rivera.

20
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,955
He deserves to die.

21
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:30,824
Isn't that a little intolerant
coming from you?

22
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:34,061
What if you were
to teach Zach the code?

23
00:02:34,095 --> 00:02:36,063
Maybe it's time to see

24
00:02:36,097 --> 00:02:38,131
if the experiment
will work.

25
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,168
What possibly makes you think
Zach could be taught the code?

26
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,536
I see something in him.

27
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,671
Why were you going
to kill your father?

28
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,740
Because he's killing
my mother.

29
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:49,242
She's drinking herself to death
because of him.

30
00:02:49,277 --> 00:02:51,678
You killed
because you want to kill.

31
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,047
You should just go ahead
and kill me.

32
00:02:54,082 --> 00:02:55,849
Why?

33
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:58,151
'Cause if you don't,
then I will do it again.

34
00:02:58,186 --> 00:02:59,419
I can't help it.

35
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:03,890
Am I ready to be
a spiritual father?

36
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:05,258
Hey, are you okay?

37
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:08,362
- I don't feel so good.
- Deb?

38
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,701
Hello, Dexter.

39
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:20,207
Remember me?

40
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:46,433
Hello?

41
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:48,268
Dexter?

42
00:03:48,302 --> 00:03:50,771
I was just about to leave you
another message.

43
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:52,205
Where have you been
all morning?

44
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,742
The last thing
I remember is...

45
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,611
Hannah.

46
00:03:57,645 --> 00:03:59,312
Is everything all right?

47
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:02,349
Not if Hannah got to Deb.

48
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:05,285
I can't really talk now.

49
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,189
I just thought you should know
that Zach Hamilton called.

50
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:12,059
I'm so glad you decided
not to kill him, Dexter.

51
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:13,960
I have to go.

52
00:04:13,995 --> 00:04:16,797
Deb, are you okay?

53
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:18,398
Dex, where the fuck are you?

54
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:21,001
Just a sec.

55
00:04:23,438 --> 00:04:25,939
I'm outside of Kendall.
Are you alone?

56
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:27,074
Why wouldn't I be?

57
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:28,975
W-why are you
on the other side of town?

58
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,811
I need you to come
pick me up.

59
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:31,978
Are you okay to drive?

60
00:04:32,013 --> 00:04:34,247
I think so.
I mean, who the fuck knows?

61
00:04:34,282 --> 00:04:38,251
I...Woke up on the floor,
feeling like shit.

62
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:39,753
You were gone.

63
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:42,522
What the--
what the fuck is happening?

64
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:44,424
Just come pick me up.

65
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,726
I'll text you the location.

66
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,361
We'll talk when you get here.

67
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,964
Hannah drugged us,

68
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:53,533
left me stranded
in the middle of nowhere.

69
00:04:53,568 --> 00:04:56,603
If she's come back because she
wants one or both of us dead,

70
00:04:56,637 --> 00:04:59,740
then why are we both
still here?

71
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,447
It was Hannah,
wasn't it?

72
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:10,650
It was.

73
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,019
I saw her
before I blacked out,

74
00:05:13,054 --> 00:05:15,155
but then I woke up here.

75
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,790
She must have
drugged our food.

76
00:05:16,824 --> 00:05:19,860
If Hannah poisoned us,
why didn't she kill us?

77
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:21,094
Who the fuck knows,
Dexter?

78
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:22,529
Maybe we were supposed
to eat more.

79
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:24,898
Or maybe she just wants
to let us know she's out there.

80
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:29,469
Maybe this was just
the beginning.

81
00:05:29,504 --> 00:05:30,771
If we were normal people,
Dexter,

82
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:33,874
we would go
to the U.S. Marshal Service.

83
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:36,076
We can't do that.
She knows everything about me.

84
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,277
Yeah, but she
didn't talk about you

85
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:38,411
the last time
she was arrested.

86
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:42,182
Because she was
in love with me.

87
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,151
Drugging me and leaving me
on the side of the road

88
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:47,721
might suggest
that's changed.

89
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:51,491
So what the fuck
are we supposed to do?

90
00:05:51,526 --> 00:05:55,328
There are
traffic surveillance cameras.

91
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:57,297
She had
to have passed them.

92
00:05:57,331 --> 00:05:58,832
I'll put in a request
for the footage,

93
00:05:58,866 --> 00:05:59,866
get a license plate.

94
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:09,309
I thought this part
of my life was over.

95
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:12,012
So did I.

96
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:15,582
The moment I asked you
to kill her

97
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:17,717
was the moment that I started
to lose myself,

98
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,720
and I'm just starting
to get back.

99
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,726
I don't want
to deal with this.

100
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,929
I want her gone.

101
00:06:28,963 --> 00:06:30,864
Deb, I'll take care of this.
I promise.

102
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:59,192
Hannah--just thinking about her
throws me off course.

103
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:08,435
I have to put in a request
for the traffic footage.

104
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:19,312
Zach, what are you
doing here?

105
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:21,014
You were supposed to meet me
at 10:00 this morning.

106
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:22,115
I've been waiting
all day.

107
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:24,484
- You could have been followed.
- By who?

108
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:27,587
Oh, Detective Quinn?
No, he's pretty easy to lose.

109
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:30,056
But one day, he'll be there
when you don't expect him.

110
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:32,559
Don't ever come
to my home again.

111
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:35,128
- I just wanted to talk to you--
- ever.

112
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:37,097
We can't be seen
in public together.

113
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:38,665
Do you understand?
That's your first lesson.

114
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,267
Okay. Jesus.
I'm--I'm sorry.

115
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:41,601
It's just--

116
00:07:41,636 --> 00:07:44,337
I-I spoke to Dr. Vogel,
and she--

117
00:07:44,372 --> 00:07:47,641
What exactly
did she tell you?

118
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:51,444
That you have this, like,

119
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:56,116
way of living that...

120
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,719
A-allows you to do what--

121
00:07:59,754 --> 00:08:01,354
what you and I
have in common,

122
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:02,989
and--

123
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,126
and that might be something
that I can do too.

124
00:08:07,962 --> 00:08:09,996
I mean, fuck,
I have so many questions.

125
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,400
And I'll answer them
as best I can.

126
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:18,138
Are you gonna help me
be like you?

127
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:20,040
Don't even pretend.

128
00:08:22,343 --> 00:08:24,844
Hi, Dexter.

129
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,447
Going
for a little night swim.

130
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:29,649
Enjoy.

131
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:31,851
Who's she?

132
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,788
- That's my neighbor.
- She's cute.

133
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:36,990
Yes, she's cute.

134
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:38,024
You need to go home.

135
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,559
When are we
gonna talk about--

136
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:40,927
I'll call you.

137
00:08:40,962 --> 00:08:42,662
Look, something has come up
that I have to deal with.

138
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:44,431
My day job,

139
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:46,633
which is something
you need to get.

140
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,168
Why?
I have money.

141
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:50,403
You're a weird guy
who lives with his mom.

142
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:53,306
You might as well be
wearing a sign.

143
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:55,842
Look, all I'm saying is
that you need

144
00:08:55,876 --> 00:08:58,545
to have
some kind of cover life,

145
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,213
something that makes you
look ordinary.

146
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:04,718
Yeah, right, yeah.
I get it, yeah.

147
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:08,288
Zach, I understand
what you're going through.

148
00:09:08,322 --> 00:09:11,458
I will help you
with this.

149
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:14,961
Okay.

150
00:09:14,996 --> 00:09:16,963
Thanks.

151
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:26,706
Not a single sighting
since she disappeared?

152
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:29,709
Thank you.

153
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:31,578
Motherfuck.

154
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,381
What you doing?

155
00:09:34,415 --> 00:09:35,882
Nothing.

156
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,619
Why do you look
like you just got caught?

157
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:40,820
Come on,
what are you doing back here?

158
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:42,122
You looking at porn over here
or something?

159
00:09:42,156 --> 00:09:43,156
- No.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

160
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,324
Company computer.
Will you-

161
00:09:44,358 --> 00:09:46,326
And I am the boss.

162
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,361
Hannah McKay.

163
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:50,797
Wayne Randall's girlfriend,
right?

164
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:52,132
Got arrested a while back
for something,

165
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,233
then somehow slipped away?

166
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:54,734
Why you--
why you looking her up?

167
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:57,837
None of your goddamn business.
Will you fucking back off?

168
00:09:57,872 --> 00:09:59,372
- Jesus, relax.
- No, I'm seri--

169
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:00,507
you come in here
all the time

170
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,875
and invade
my personal space,

171
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:03,676
standing so close,

172
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:05,078
trying to flirt.

173
00:10:05,112 --> 00:10:07,013
You're fucking
making me uncomfortable.

174
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:08,648
I didn't come in here
to flirt, okay?

175
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:10,216
I just came in here to see
if you wanted me

176
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:14,788
to pick you up something
for lunch, that's it.

177
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,058
I'm all set.

178
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:21,294
Are we done?

179
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:23,363
Yeah.

180
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:27,267
Yeah, we're done.

181
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:31,171
You know what?
We're not done, actually.

182
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:32,405
See, Deb, you came to me
six months ago,

183
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,740
an emotional wreck,

184
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:36,743
saying you just quit the force
and you needed a job.

185
00:10:36,777 --> 00:10:38,445
I gave you that job.

186
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,779
I gave you good pay,
good benefits.

187
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:42,015
I didn't ask
a lot of questions.

188
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:44,717
I put up with a lot
of weird shit from you

189
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:46,319
because you're good
at your job

190
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:47,821
and because I'm a nice guy.

191
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:52,826
So I'm really, really sorry
if this cramps your style,

192
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,262
but next time, maybe you want
to try a little gratitude

193
00:10:56,297 --> 00:10:59,165
instead of always being
such a fucking bitch.

194
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:04,104
Now we're done.

195
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:19,018
There she is.

196
00:11:25,493 --> 00:11:28,461
Vista Marina car rentals.

197
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:48,081
Vista marina car rentals.
This is Stacy.

198
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:49,082
How may I help you?

199
00:11:49,116 --> 00:11:50,216
Hi, Stacy.

200
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,919
This is Detective Cooper
over at Miami Metro.

201
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:56,789
My badge number is
143634.

202
00:11:56,824 --> 00:11:58,958
We're investigating
a hit and run.

203
00:11:58,993 --> 00:12:01,528
We think somebody
who rented one of your vans

204
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:02,829
might have been
a witness,

205
00:12:02,863 --> 00:12:05,064
so I was hoping to get
some information over the phone.

206
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:09,402
I can fax you over a copy
of the warrant, if you'd like.

207
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:11,971
Oh, I'll just get it for you.
Do you have the license plate?

208
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:13,540
Yes, I do.

209
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:17,644
It's, uh, GLV43951.

210
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,915
The name on that account
is Maggie Castner.

211
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,651
The local address is
slip 23, Vista Marina.

212
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:27,720
Thank you, Stacy.

213
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:30,490
Want the phone number?

214
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:32,559
Yes,
that would be helpful.

215
00:12:32,593 --> 00:12:36,696
813398-2723.

216
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,065
You may have found her.

217
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:41,501
If so,
a little too easily.

218
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:43,903
You think
she wants to be found?

219
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:46,773
I think she wants
to destroy our lives,

220
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,741
mine and Debra's both.

221
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:51,244
Debra's very fragile
right now.

222
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:52,979
Even the threat
of Hannah coming after her

223
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,381
could derail all the progress
she's making.

224
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,083
I won't let that happen.

225
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:59,719
So what's your plan?

226
00:12:59,753 --> 00:13:01,421
Slip 23.

227
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:03,089
You have her number.
You could call.

228
00:13:03,123 --> 00:13:07,360
I don't want to let her know
I've found her yet.

229
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:11,030
Why do you seem
less scared than excited?

230
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:13,099
Because Hannah
doesn't scare me.

231
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:16,603
Maybe you need
to rethink that.

232
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,407
They all look
like nice apartments,

233
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:23,576
but I think you should work
things out with your brother.

234
00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:24,978
Angel and I
are gonna be fine.

235
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,446
I've just had it

236
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,415
with the whole "big brother
ruling over the roost" routine.

237
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,418
And the thing is...

238
00:13:35,122 --> 00:13:37,023
What?

239
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:38,124
Well, just,
most of these places,

240
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:39,993
I have to sign
a one-year lease,

241
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,562
and I wasn't sure
about...

242
00:13:42,596 --> 00:13:45,531
About what?

243
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:48,601
Okay, I'm definitely not
pushing you, okay?

244
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:50,470
I'm just trying
to be practical here.

245
00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:54,073
If our relationship
keeps moving forward,

246
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:58,211
we might want to eventually get
a place together.

247
00:13:58,245 --> 00:13:59,846
Yeah, eventually.

248
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,414
You don't have to decide now.

249
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:02,915
It's just something
to think about.

250
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,387
Yeah, I'll totally think
about it.

251
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:09,522
Okay.

252
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:12,859
I'm so sorry.

253
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,662
I-I blew that whole thing
out of proportion, I think.

254
00:14:15,696 --> 00:14:16,763
I just felt like
you were trying

255
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:19,265
to, like, get rid of me
with a check.

256
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,136
I was just trying to be
a good, you know, father.

257
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,137
That was really sweet
of you.

258
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:26,372
But it's my problem,

259
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,607
and I want
to take care of it.

260
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:31,277
Well, I can respect that.
So we're cool?

261
00:14:31,312 --> 00:14:32,412
Cool.

262
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:34,147
How about you and I
do dinner tonight?

263
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:35,315
I can't.

264
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:37,750
I have to work
right after class.

265
00:14:37,785 --> 00:14:39,452
You know,
pay off the debts.

266
00:14:39,486 --> 00:14:41,120
Wow, well,
good for you.

267
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:43,489
Where are you working?

268
00:14:43,524 --> 00:14:46,359
It's a sports bar
called Lucky Pete's.

269
00:14:46,393 --> 00:14:49,295
I can, uh, call you, though,
when I'm free.

270
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,296
We can get together.

271
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:52,899
Okay.
Sounds great.

272
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:16,022
The Hannah McKay I know
hated the ocean.

273
00:15:16,056 --> 00:15:18,491
But it does make
for an easy escape

274
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:22,895
into international waters.

275
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,566
Brave of her to be walking
around Miami like that.

276
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,703
Or maybe she's found someone
to protect her.

277
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:31,431
- May I help you?
- I'm just meeting some friends.

278
00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:33,900
I'm sorry, sir.
Members only.

279
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:35,034
Oh, but I'm a friend of--

280
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:38,037
Even so, sir,
we have a strict dress code.

281
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:53,786
Call it a night,
Dexter.

282
00:16:53,821 --> 00:16:56,422
You don't want to go in there.
I do want to go in there.

283
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:57,523
It's their territory.

284
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,259
You'll be
at a disadvantage.

285
00:17:00,294 --> 00:17:03,963
I need to know
what she's up to.

286
00:17:12,673 --> 00:17:14,607
Dexter.

287
00:17:14,641 --> 00:17:17,710
Is your father a member
at the Red Coral Club?

288
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:18,811
Yeah.

289
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:21,080
It's full of old farts in suits.
Why?

290
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:23,716
Can you get me in there?
Tonight?

291
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,586
Yeah.
Sure.

292
00:17:41,535 --> 00:17:46,405
Good to see you,
Mr. Hamilton.

293
00:17:50,077 --> 00:17:52,445
So what are we doing here?

294
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:54,013
Looking for someone.

295
00:17:54,047 --> 00:17:56,983
I thought we weren't
supposed to be seen together.

296
00:17:57,017 --> 00:17:59,585
This is different.

297
00:18:03,223 --> 00:18:05,858
You know her?

298
00:18:07,928 --> 00:18:10,329
That's my ex-girlfriend.

299
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:15,134
Nice.
Who's the guy?

300
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:17,803
I'm gonna find out.

301
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:19,906
All right,you keep an.

302
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,341
You text me
when he's coming back.

303
00:18:22,376 --> 00:18:24,076
Got it.

304
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,289
Hannah.

305
00:18:40,827 --> 00:18:43,963
It's Maggie now.

306
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,598
You shouldn't be here,
Dexter.

307
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:47,833
Well, I'm not leaving
until you tell me

308
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:49,902
why you drugged me and left me
on the side of the road.

309
00:18:49,937 --> 00:18:51,137
Well,
after what you did to me,

310
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,806
I'm not sure
that you get to ask questions.

311
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,441
But here I am,
asking.

312
00:18:55,475 --> 00:18:56,943
What are you doing
back in Miami?

313
00:18:56,977 --> 00:19:01,113
Well, I was
about to enjoy a Martini.

314
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:02,415
You should probably leave,
though,

315
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:04,150
before my husband returns.

316
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,919
Your husband?

317
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:12,291
You're married
to that guy?

318
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,365
Yes.
I'm very lucky.

319
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:21,934
Yeah, well, he seems rich.

320
00:19:21,969 --> 00:19:23,269
You were always
a pragmatist.

321
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:26,105
Well, the money's nice,
I have to admit, but...

322
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:29,809
He has other talents.

323
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:32,845
Miles is
the adventurous type.

324
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:37,650
What are you doing here,
Hannah?

325
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:39,652
My husband will be back
any minute,

326
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:41,153
and it's probably
in your best interest

327
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:42,321
that he not see us
together.

328
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:43,656
Well, I told you,
I'm not leaving

329
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,424
until you tell me
why you did what you did to me.

330
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:47,259
I see
you've made a friend.

331
00:19:47,294 --> 00:19:51,397
This is my husband,
Miles Castner.

332
00:19:51,431 --> 00:19:53,132
Dexter Morgan.

333
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,967
Dexter Morgan.

334
00:19:55,002 --> 00:19:56,602
Maggie has told me
about you.

335
00:19:56,637 --> 00:19:58,938
Oh?

336
00:19:58,972 --> 00:20:00,239
How you were
her boyfriend,

337
00:20:00,273 --> 00:20:01,273
until you betrayed her,

338
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:03,442
turning her in
to the police.

339
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:06,112
Quite a predicament
you left her in.

340
00:20:06,146 --> 00:20:09,815
Shall we finish
our drinks?

341
00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:12,818
I think it's time
for us to go.

342
00:20:12,853 --> 00:20:15,254
Well,
that's an excellent idea.

343
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:18,190
Make sure Mr. Morgan is given
whatever he needs.

344
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:28,434
Didn't you get
my texts?

345
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:30,036
I warned you
that guy was coming.

346
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,270
I know.

347
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:33,806
So why didn't you
walk away?

348
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,241
I mean, I watched him.
I stayed on him.

349
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,242
I didn't fuck up in there.

350
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,544
I screwed up, not you.

351
00:20:38,578 --> 00:20:41,647
You did exactly
as I asked you to.

352
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,286
So what now?

353
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,422
Nothing.

354
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,857
I'll call you.
We'll talk tomorrow.

355
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:54,560
So that guy,
are we--

356
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:59,665
are you gonna
kill him?

357
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:03,369
I only kill people
who deserve it.

358
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:06,238
You here,

359
00:21:06,273 --> 00:21:08,107
'cause something
sure ain't right.

360
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,643
While them orphans
was camping in the woods,

361
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:13,379
something gave them
a proper fright.

362
00:21:13,413 --> 00:21:14,480
Miles Castner

363
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:17,550
made his fortune
in international casinos.

364
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:19,051
He has the power
and the reach

365
00:21:19,086 --> 00:21:21,887
to get Hannah
a new name, new passport,

366
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:25,057
but if she's as happy
as she seems in her new life,

367
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:29,662
then why is she here,
messing with mine?

368
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:31,197
Miles Castner--

369
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:33,733
what kind of name
is Miles, anyway?

370
00:21:35,102 --> 00:21:38,170
Don't be a chump, zoomer!

371
00:21:38,205 --> 00:21:39,271
Ain't no such thing as...

372
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:42,141
- Hey.
- Hey.

373
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,009
Hey.

374
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:45,811
Hello.

375
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,981
Harrison, hello.

376
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:52,118
That's it?

377
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:54,854
I remember
when I used to get a hug.

378
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:56,822
Even I don't matter
when <i>rastamouse</i> is on.

379
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,125
I checked in
with Marshals, FBI,

380
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,693
fucking Homeland Security.

381
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:03,362
There hasn't been a single
sighting of Hannah McKay.

382
00:22:03,396 --> 00:22:04,463
I'm hoping
you've had better luck.

383
00:22:04,498 --> 00:22:07,900
Yeah.
I found her.

384
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:10,569
She's married.

385
00:22:10,604 --> 00:22:14,240
Well, there's someone
for everyone, I guess.

386
00:22:14,274 --> 00:22:17,376
I hope he's sleeping
with one eye open.

387
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,044
What's her married name?

388
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,580
The guy she's married to
is worth $700 million.

389
00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:23,916
He owns casinos.

390
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,919
The name, Dex.

391
00:22:26,953 --> 00:22:29,922
Castner.

392
00:22:29,956 --> 00:22:31,957
Miles Castner.

393
00:22:31,992 --> 00:22:34,894
They're staying
on his yacht.

394
00:22:34,928 --> 00:22:36,262
I don't know what they're doing
in Miami.

395
00:22:36,296 --> 00:22:39,532
Maybe he has business here
or something.

396
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:43,369
But he seems to know
who she is,

397
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,337
even knows
about her and me.

398
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:47,807
And she...

399
00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:50,342
Seems to like him,

400
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:52,478
or maybe she just
feels obligated to him.

401
00:22:52,512 --> 00:22:55,514
I doubt Hannah McKay
feels obligated to anyone.

402
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:57,316
It's got
to be operational.

403
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,617
She needs
a cover life.

404
00:22:58,652 --> 00:23:01,787
It's not like
it's a real marriage.

405
00:23:01,822 --> 00:23:05,491
She can't actually
love this guy.

406
00:23:05,525 --> 00:23:07,693
Oh, my God.

407
00:23:10,697 --> 00:23:12,031
You're still in love
with her, aren't you?

408
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:14,533
What?
No.

409
00:23:14,568 --> 00:23:17,536
She's probably trying
to kill me.

410
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:24,176
Trust me,

411
00:23:24,211 --> 00:23:25,511
no one knows
what it's like

412
00:23:25,545 --> 00:23:27,079
to fall in love
with the wrong person

413
00:23:27,113 --> 00:23:30,182
more than I do.

414
00:23:30,217 --> 00:23:33,652
But you better get
your fucking head on straight.

415
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:37,556
She is everything
that is wrong with our lives.

416
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:40,125
She is a vortex.
She is a black hole.

417
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,361
She sucks everything
into her being,

418
00:23:42,395 --> 00:23:46,932
leaving nothing behind.

419
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,301
We have got to get her
out of our lives.

420
00:23:49,336 --> 00:23:52,771
I'm working on a plan.

421
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,411
Are you sure
you can be objective?

422
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:01,947
One little toss
of Hannah's pretty blonde hair,

423
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:06,118
and you turn
into a fucking moron.

424
00:24:06,152 --> 00:24:07,553
Hannah?

425
00:24:07,587 --> 00:24:10,589
Hannah is here?

426
00:24:10,624 --> 00:24:12,157
Both of you?
Jesus.

427
00:24:12,192 --> 00:24:13,158
Really?

428
00:24:13,193 --> 00:24:15,628
Deb, I'm on top of it.

429
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,630
I'm gonna figure out
exactly what she's up to.

430
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,733
Are you?

431
00:24:22,736 --> 00:24:25,604
Where is Hannah?

432
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:29,108
Right now,
she's on a very big boat

433
00:24:29,142 --> 00:24:31,076
with her husband.

434
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,392
Niki?

435
00:24:46,426 --> 00:24:48,894
Hey.
Hey, what are you doing here?

436
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:50,296
I came here
to see you.

437
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,565
I didn't realize
this place was a breastaurant.

438
00:24:56,102 --> 00:24:58,137
I mean, it is a sports bar.
It's just topless.

439
00:24:58,171 --> 00:24:59,838
And I make
really good money here.

440
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:03,142
Are you really okay
doing this?

441
00:25:03,176 --> 00:25:04,810
Yeah, it's not the best job
in the world,

442
00:25:04,844 --> 00:25:06,145
but it's also not forever.

443
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:07,780
I'm fine with it.

444
00:25:07,814 --> 00:25:08,981
I can tell
that you're not.

445
00:25:09,015 --> 00:25:11,283
Me?
Oh.

446
00:25:11,318 --> 00:25:14,019
Look, I go to places like this
all the time.

447
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,387
- See?
- I--

448
00:25:15,422 --> 00:25:16,689
look, I've stared
at a million boobs.

449
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,757
But until now,
I never considered them

450
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:21,627
to be...
daughter boobs.

451
00:25:23,463 --> 00:25:24,930
Daughter boobs?

452
00:25:24,965 --> 00:25:26,832
Well, come on.
You know what I mean.

453
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:29,301
Guy, hey.
Her face is up here, okay?

454
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:30,302
Come on.

455
00:25:30,337 --> 00:25:32,471
It's so sweet
that you care.

456
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:33,605
I'm just gonna stay here

457
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,474
until something better
comes along, okay?

458
00:25:35,508 --> 00:25:38,310
Yeah, I'll, uh--
I'll let you do your thing.

459
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:39,979
Do you want to have dinner
on my next free night?

460
00:25:40,013 --> 00:25:42,581
Yeah.

461
00:25:42,615 --> 00:25:45,517
That's great.

462
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,154
It actually makes sense,
in a way,

463
00:25:49,189 --> 00:25:51,857
that Dexter would have been
involved with another killer.

464
00:25:51,891 --> 00:25:54,360
- Well, she's back.
- Mm.

465
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:55,494
And she poisoned us.

466
00:25:55,528 --> 00:25:56,862
Who knows what the fuck else
she has planned?

467
00:25:56,896 --> 00:25:58,297
What does Dexter say?

468
00:25:58,331 --> 00:26:00,099
He's trying to figure out
what else she's up to,

469
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:02,468
but I'm afraid he's thinking
with the wrong head right now.

470
00:26:02,502 --> 00:26:03,669
You're concerned
for your safety.

471
00:26:03,703 --> 00:26:05,304
And for Dexter's.

472
00:26:05,338 --> 00:26:07,439
Let's take a step back.

473
00:26:07,474 --> 00:26:09,108
From what you've told me,

474
00:26:09,142 --> 00:26:11,810
if she wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead by now.

475
00:26:11,845 --> 00:26:12,811
Well, maybe she just wants
to prove

476
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:13,979
that she has control,

477
00:26:14,014 --> 00:26:15,881
that she can kill us
whenever she wants to.

478
00:26:15,915 --> 00:26:17,516
It's a very unsettling
feeling, isn't it?

479
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,550
Yeah, it is.

480
00:26:18,585 --> 00:26:20,019
So what is it
you'd like to do?

481
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:22,521
I would like to take her
to Marshal Services

482
00:26:22,555 --> 00:26:23,689
and have her
the fuck arrested.

483
00:26:23,723 --> 00:26:27,793
- But Hannah knows too much.
- Yeah.

484
00:26:27,827 --> 00:26:29,094
But at least
I wouldn't have to worry

485
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,464
about what might or might not be
in my morning coffee.

486
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:36,001
When the brain surgeon
was out there,

487
00:26:36,036 --> 00:26:37,970
a threat to me,

488
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:40,272
I-I could hardly sleep.

489
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:42,641
I trusted Dexter
to solve the problem,

490
00:26:42,675 --> 00:26:46,412
and he did.

491
00:26:49,282 --> 00:26:50,482
And if I can't?

492
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:53,118
Before you take matters
into your own hands,

493
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,255
be sure to consider all the
consequences of those actions.

494
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:01,994
The husband is a complication
I don't need.

495
00:27:02,028 --> 00:27:05,631
I have to get Hannah alone,
in a situation I control.

496
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:10,035
Have you done the blood work
on the triple in Lummus Park?

497
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,737
Not yet.

498
00:27:11,771 --> 00:27:14,573
There's the prints on the
pesticide bottle still to run

499
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:15,774
and the decomp
over in Coconut Grove

500
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:18,077
we still have to process.
Yep.

501
00:27:18,111 --> 00:27:22,214
Whew, we could use
an extra set of hands, right?

502
00:27:22,248 --> 00:27:24,049
Someone lower level,

503
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:25,851
an extra warm body
to offset all the cold ones.

504
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:27,086
Don't you think?

505
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,721
I mean, at least to make a dent
in the paperwork.

506
00:27:29,756 --> 00:27:30,856
Sure, I guess.

507
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,859
Excellent idea.

508
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:43,035
Zach...
What's he doing here?

509
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:51,543
Quinn.

510
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,418
Okay.

511
00:27:59,452 --> 00:28:02,454
My client requests
that you cease and desist

512
00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:05,390
this 24-hour watch
you have on him.

513
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:06,492
He requests it.

514
00:28:06,526 --> 00:28:09,561
I'd like you
to back the fuck off.

515
00:28:21,374 --> 00:28:22,941
You took these photos,
Zach?

516
00:28:22,976 --> 00:28:25,944
Yeah, and those
are just the best ones.

517
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:27,513
Quinn, do you have
anything to say?

518
00:28:27,547 --> 00:28:28,680
Yeah, I think
the kid's guilty.

519
00:28:28,715 --> 00:28:30,816
I'll answer for you,
Detective Quinn.

520
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,217
On behalf
of the entire department,

521
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,886
I can assure you
that we will--

522
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,454
well, how did you
put it, Zach?

523
00:28:35,488 --> 00:28:36,655
"Back the fuck down."

524
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:39,091
- "Off."
- Yeah that too.

525
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:40,659
Right,
Detective Quinn?

526
00:28:40,693 --> 00:28:43,362
- Right.
- That's right.

527
00:28:43,396 --> 00:28:46,999
Gentlemen,
let me show you out.

528
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:54,673
What the fuck
were you thinking?

529
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:56,208
That rich asshole
is walking around, free.

530
00:28:56,242 --> 00:28:57,509
We have nothing
on this kid.

531
00:28:57,544 --> 00:28:58,944
That's why I was
following him.

532
00:28:58,978 --> 00:29:00,179
Yeah, if this was
any other case,

533
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:02,214
I would personally sign off
on the overtime.

534
00:29:02,248 --> 00:29:05,617
But this one...

535
00:29:05,652 --> 00:29:06,685
Let it go.

536
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:09,021
That's an order.

537
00:29:11,591 --> 00:29:14,660
By the way, me and Jamie
are moving in together.

538
00:29:14,694 --> 00:29:16,395
You're what?
You're doing what?

539
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:17,462
Hey, uh,
you got a minute?

540
00:29:17,497 --> 00:29:19,097
Uh, make it fast.

541
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,366
Okay, well, Dexter and I
are buried in that glass box.

542
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:22,701
We need an assistant.

543
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:23,769
I don't know about that.

544
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:24,970
Wait, hold on,
we've been under budget

545
00:29:25,004 --> 00:29:26,471
the last three quarters.

546
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:28,473
It was Dexter's idea.
Okay.

547
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:31,877
Part-time.

548
00:29:31,911 --> 00:29:34,913
You're one hell
of a lieutenant.

549
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:47,793
The photos
we a nice touch.

550
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,932
Thanks.
I thought so.

551
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:56,101
Well,
now he's off my tail.

552
00:29:56,135 --> 00:29:58,804
We can get down
to business.

553
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:01,206
Find someone to...
You know.

554
00:30:01,241 --> 00:30:03,442
Eventually.

555
00:30:03,476 --> 00:30:05,510
What do you mean,
"eventually"?

556
00:30:05,545 --> 00:30:09,047
I mean...

557
00:30:09,082 --> 00:30:12,284
Long before my father taught me
how to do what I do,

558
00:30:12,318 --> 00:30:15,621
he taught me
how not to do it.

559
00:30:15,655 --> 00:30:18,056
Why would I want
to not do it?

560
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:20,659
Timing is everything.

561
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:21,960
One thing
you need to learn--

562
00:30:21,995 --> 00:30:24,896
the first thing
that I had to learn--

563
00:30:24,931 --> 00:30:26,898
is to wait.

564
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:29,201
Control your urges.

565
00:30:29,235 --> 00:30:32,204
Channel them appropriately.

566
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:34,840
Dexter, I can't wait.

567
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,708
I can't control it.

568
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:39,911
Yes, you can.

569
00:30:39,946 --> 00:30:42,848
You're gonna get your chance,
Zach, I promise.

570
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,816
But the only way I've survived
as long as I have

571
00:30:44,851 --> 00:30:46,518
is by being careful.

572
00:30:46,552 --> 00:30:49,054
I'm gonna teach you
how to do that.

573
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,656
And then?

574
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:53,925
And then you'll be able
to do what I do

575
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,629
and get away with it.

576
00:31:24,657 --> 00:31:25,624
What do you want?

577
00:31:25,658 --> 00:31:27,392
I saw you
with your son.

578
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:31,129
Maggie never mentioned him.

579
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:32,464
Hard to picture her
as the family type.

580
00:31:32,498 --> 00:31:34,900
There's nothing going on
between Hannah and me.

581
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,201
Good.
Then listen.

582
00:31:36,235 --> 00:31:38,437
I'd sooner see her in prison
than lose her.

583
00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:40,605
Do you understand?

584
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,574
Because I could call
a few people

585
00:31:42,608 --> 00:31:43,709
and ruin your life.

586
00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:45,911
And being a family man,

587
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:49,014
I'm sure
that's not what you'd want.

588
00:31:52,185 --> 00:31:56,655
People are so impatient.

589
00:32:05,264 --> 00:32:06,665
Dexter,
what are you doing?

590
00:32:06,699 --> 00:32:09,735
This is something you don't want
to get in the middle of.

591
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:17,275
He said he'd sooner see her
in prison than lose her.

592
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,910
If that's what he thinks
this is about,

593
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:20,445
she's the one in danger.

594
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,847
I thought you were going
to find out

595
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:24,449
if Hannah was a threat
to you and Debra,

596
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,751
not if Miles was a threat

597
00:32:25,785 --> 00:32:28,487
to Hannah.

598
00:32:30,223 --> 00:32:32,624
Why can't I do both?

599
00:33:05,591 --> 00:33:08,927
Your flowers.

600
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:10,228
That's the thing
about plants.

601
00:33:10,263 --> 00:33:13,865
You don't look after 'em,
they die.

602
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,039
So...What's up?

603
00:33:21,073 --> 00:33:24,943
Miles just confronted me
at a gas station.

604
00:33:24,977 --> 00:33:28,680
God.
He likes to be dramatic.

605
00:33:28,714 --> 00:33:30,148
Is he a threat?

606
00:33:30,183 --> 00:33:33,952
A "chop you up and toss you
in the ocean" kind of threat?

607
00:33:33,986 --> 00:33:36,021
No.

608
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,789
But he could
make your life miserable,

609
00:33:37,824 --> 00:33:39,191
have people look into you

610
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:42,227
and follow you around 24/7.

611
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:43,995
He sounds
like a great guy.

612
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,365
And you're really
in a position to judge?

613
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,567
Why did you marry him?

614
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:53,605
Because he was there
when you weren't.

615
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:56,174
I needed him, Dexter.

616
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:57,943
I met him
a few years ago

617
00:33:57,977 --> 00:34:00,145
when I did some flowers for him
at an event,

618
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:03,915
and he found
my background intriguing.

619
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,851
I could tell that he had
a bit of a crush on me,

620
00:34:05,885 --> 00:34:08,053
so when I made my little escape
and when I had nothing

621
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,287
and when I was desperate,

622
00:34:09,322 --> 00:34:11,590
I knew that he could give me
a whole new life,

623
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:12,891
a new identity,

624
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:16,361
money.

625
00:34:16,395 --> 00:34:20,398
Plus, he makes me happy.

626
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,399
Bullshit.

627
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,935
If you're so damn happy,

628
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,237
what are you doing
back here?

629
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,239
Why did you
drug Debra and me?

630
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,240
You know,
I think you should go.

631
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,374
No, answer me.

632
00:34:29,408 --> 00:34:31,009
I wanted to make sure

633
00:34:31,043 --> 00:34:32,410
that you weren't gonna
put me in jail.

634
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,145
I had to see
if you would come to me.

635
00:34:35,815 --> 00:34:38,049
Because it doesn't matter why
anymore.

636
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:39,050
I changed my mind.

637
00:34:39,085 --> 00:34:41,453
About what?

638
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:46,458
I wanted you
to kill Miles for me.

639
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:53,231
You what?

640
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:55,767
He's possessive
and controlling

641
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:57,168
and obsessed with me
to the point

642
00:34:57,203 --> 00:34:58,403
where he follows me
everywhere.

643
00:34:58,437 --> 00:35:01,873
I might as well be
in prison.

644
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:02,941
If I were to try
and leave him,

645
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,544
he would--
he would just turn me in.

646
00:35:05,578 --> 00:35:07,579
Why haven't you dealt
with this in your usual way?

647
00:35:07,613 --> 00:35:08,680
Because his family
already thought

648
00:35:08,714 --> 00:35:10,115
that I was some kind
of gold digger

649
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,149
when we got married.

650
00:35:11,183 --> 00:35:12,651
If he was gonna
drop dead suddenly,

651
00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:13,919
for no reason,

652
00:35:13,953 --> 00:35:15,420
I would be the first person
that they would turn to.

653
00:35:15,454 --> 00:35:17,088
And once the cops get
a good look at me--

654
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:20,258
You wanted me
to make him disappear.

655
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:24,763
I thought you might feel
like you owed me.

656
00:35:24,797 --> 00:35:27,265
- Owed you?
- You didn't have to turn me in.

657
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,100
You ruined my life.
I did-

658
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:31,036
You know, it doesn't even
matter anymore,

659
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,404
because like I said,
I changed my mind.

660
00:35:32,438 --> 00:35:33,672
And this is my problem,

661
00:35:33,706 --> 00:35:35,040
and I'm gonna find
a way to deal with it.

662
00:35:35,074 --> 00:35:38,109
Why did you
change your mind?

663
00:35:38,144 --> 00:35:40,679
Because the moment that
I saw you there, unconscious,

664
00:35:40,713 --> 00:35:41,813
I realized that,

665
00:35:41,847 --> 00:35:43,615
despite the shitty way
that it all ended,

666
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:46,618
you were it
for me, Dexter.

667
00:35:48,988 --> 00:35:53,592
I've never felt that way
about anyone before or since.

668
00:35:54,994 --> 00:35:59,097
You're the only person
that I can be that honest with.

669
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:03,501
And I didn't want
to ruin that

670
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,538
by manipulating you
into doing something

671
00:36:06,572 --> 00:36:09,174
that might be bad
for you.

672
00:36:15,147 --> 00:36:18,116
It was the same
for me.

673
00:36:20,953 --> 00:36:22,420
No, just leave it
at that.

674
00:36:22,455 --> 00:36:24,556
I have to go before Miles
finds out where I've gone.

675
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,726
- Hannah...
- Good-bye.

676
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:36,568
Hey.

677
00:36:36,602 --> 00:36:40,872
Um, can I borrow that
high-tech G.P.S. tracker thingy

678
00:36:40,906 --> 00:36:42,607
that you have?

679
00:36:42,642 --> 00:36:45,443
Please?

680
00:36:45,478 --> 00:36:46,578
Yeah.

681
00:36:46,612 --> 00:36:48,747
Being nice
when you need something, huh?

682
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:51,783
I'm not surprised.

683
00:36:55,554 --> 00:36:58,757
Sorry
that I overreacted earlier.

684
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:02,827
I know
that you're interested.

685
00:37:02,862 --> 00:37:04,629
You act like you are.

686
00:37:04,664 --> 00:37:07,666
But, Jake, you don't want
to get involved with me.

687
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,634
You have no idea
who I really am.

688
00:37:09,669 --> 00:37:13,104
I just want a chance
to find out.

689
00:37:33,392 --> 00:37:35,894
Can I help you?
Is that your car?

690
00:37:35,928 --> 00:37:39,431
Um, it--
it's my brother's car.

691
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,733
I think I left my sunglasses
in the passenger seat,

692
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:43,168
and he's not answering
his phone.

693
00:37:43,202 --> 00:37:44,369
Your brother is...

694
00:37:44,403 --> 00:37:46,037
Dexter Morgan.
He lives in the building.

695
00:37:46,072 --> 00:37:47,972
Oh.
Oh, you're Dexter's sister.

696
00:37:48,007 --> 00:37:50,275
I'm Cassie, his neighbor.
Debra.

697
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,944
Oh, fuck, you're Cassie
who went out with him, right?

698
00:37:52,978 --> 00:37:55,013
Really?
He mentioned me?

699
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:56,214
You look surprised.

700
00:37:56,248 --> 00:37:57,382
I am.

701
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:59,284
I, uh, I guess I figured

702
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,585
he thought
I was the worst date ever.

703
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:01,986
He didn't exactly
follow up.

704
00:38:02,021 --> 00:38:03,154
But he's always nice to me
when I see him.

705
00:38:03,189 --> 00:38:05,123
He's kind of impossible
to read.

706
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,192
Yeah,
that would be Dexter.

707
00:38:07,226 --> 00:38:08,760
Oh, okay, good, I was starting
to think it was me.

708
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:11,196
Nope,
definitely not you.

709
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,865
Hey, um,
since I've got you here,

710
00:38:13,899 --> 00:38:15,233
what's his deal?

711
00:38:15,267 --> 00:38:17,602
Jamie seems to think
he's not over his ex-girlfriend,

712
00:38:17,636 --> 00:38:19,471
which totally makes him
more attractive to me,

713
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,273
'cause apparently, I have
a thing for unavailable men.

714
00:38:22,308 --> 00:38:23,575
Sorry.
That was an overshare.

715
00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:25,276
That's all right.
I get it.

716
00:38:25,311 --> 00:38:26,277
It's so crazy, right?

717
00:38:26,312 --> 00:38:27,278
I meet
this totally nice guy

718
00:38:27,313 --> 00:38:29,114
who's completely
into me,

719
00:38:29,148 --> 00:38:30,448
and I'm still hung up

720
00:38:30,483 --> 00:38:34,152
on the mysterious man next door
who hasn't called.

721
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,789
I don't know you...
At all, actually.

722
00:38:37,823 --> 00:38:40,425
But you seem
like a normal girl, you know?

723
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:41,960
If I were you,
I would probably stick

724
00:38:41,994 --> 00:38:46,331
with the guy
that's obviously interested.

725
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,899
Trust me,
Dexter is not a mystery

726
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:50,769
that you want to solve.

727
00:38:52,738 --> 00:38:53,872
Okay.

728
00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:55,340
Yeah.
Sorry about all that.

729
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,341
It's all right.
Have a good one.

730
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,409
See you.

731
00:39:03,783 --> 00:39:05,150
- Hey!
- Hey.

732
00:39:05,184 --> 00:39:07,285
You could've come inside.
I just got your text.

733
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:08,486
Oh, well,
you know,

734
00:39:08,521 --> 00:39:10,989
I think I've seen enough
of that place, you know.

735
00:39:11,023 --> 00:39:13,358
So...
What brings you by?

736
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,059
I wanted
to let you know

737
00:39:15,094 --> 00:39:18,062
that a lab assistant position
just opened up at Miami Metro,

738
00:39:18,097 --> 00:39:20,064
and it's yours
if you want it.

739
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:21,065
What does it pay?

740
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,903
$13.75 an hour,
plus dental.

741
00:39:24,937 --> 00:39:26,604
I make a lot more money
than that here.

742
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:28,973
You did say that
this wasn't your first choice

743
00:39:29,008 --> 00:39:30,809
as a line of work.
Yeah.

744
00:39:30,843 --> 00:39:32,076
I figured
you'd jump at the chance

745
00:39:32,111 --> 00:39:33,178
for a future that didn't
include pole dancing.

746
00:39:33,212 --> 00:39:36,748
I'm not gonna
be a stripper, Dad.

747
00:39:36,782 --> 00:39:38,550
Whoa.

748
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,952
Hey, it just slipped out.

749
00:39:40,986 --> 00:39:43,454
That's okay.

750
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:44,789
Well, listen,
just do me a favor.

751
00:39:44,824 --> 00:39:45,924
Just think about it,
okay?

752
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:48,259
I think it would be good
for the both of us.

753
00:39:48,294 --> 00:39:50,328
Okay.
All right.

754
00:39:52,198 --> 00:39:55,066
- Bye.
- Bye.

755
00:39:56,635 --> 00:39:59,871
Well, that's probably best
for all involved.

756
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:02,807
Two psychopaths together--

757
00:40:02,842 --> 00:40:03,808
never a good mix.

758
00:40:03,843 --> 00:40:06,911
Hannah's not a psychopath.

759
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,112
She has feelings.

760
00:40:08,147 --> 00:40:09,547
I'll have to take
your word for that.

761
00:40:09,582 --> 00:40:11,382
Anyway, I called you
over here tonight

762
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:13,518
because I'm concerned
about Zach.

763
00:40:13,552 --> 00:40:16,454
He came to me today
in a very agitated state.

764
00:40:16,488 --> 00:40:18,523
I know, I didn't let him
kill his father,

765
00:40:18,557 --> 00:40:20,458
and now he's feeling the urge
more than ever.

766
00:40:20,492 --> 00:40:24,362
And how do you plan
to handle it?

767
00:40:24,396 --> 00:40:25,463
I was ten years old

768
00:40:25,497 --> 00:40:27,432
when Harry told me
what my future would be.

769
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:31,369
I didn't kill
until I was 19.

770
00:40:31,403 --> 00:40:32,370
Zach can wait.

771
00:40:32,404 --> 00:40:36,608
He just doesn't know
he can.

772
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:40,144
- Apples and oranges, Dexter.
- Sorry?

773
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:42,046
You thought you had no choice
but to wait

774
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:44,883
because your father
told you to.

775
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:49,387
But you were just a boy
who'd never taken a human life.

776
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:51,990
- Zach has already killed.
- Don't get me wrong.

777
00:40:52,024 --> 00:40:54,158
I'm glad you took him
off your table.

778
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:56,728
But the moment you did,

779
00:40:56,762 --> 00:41:00,665
Zach became
your responsibility.

780
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:03,735
He's relying on you,
Dexter.

781
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:08,172
You need to take this
very seriously.

782
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,310
Hi, you've reached
Zach Hamilton.

783
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,345
Please leave a message.

784
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,581
Hey, Zach.
It's Dexter.

785
00:41:16,615 --> 00:41:19,350
Let's meet tomorrow afternoon,
2:00 p.m.

786
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:21,386
I'll come
to your studio.

787
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,729
It's good
that Hannah's leaving.

788
00:41:31,764 --> 00:41:32,931
I have enough on my plate

789
00:41:32,965 --> 00:41:36,901
trying to turn a young killer
into...

790
00:41:36,936 --> 00:41:39,137
Someone like me.

791
00:42:15,274 --> 00:42:18,509
Miles knows that Hannah and I
saw each other yesterday.

792
00:42:20,612 --> 00:42:24,248
If Miles
will do this to me,

793
00:42:24,283 --> 00:42:27,785
what will he do
to her?

794
00:42:29,321 --> 00:42:31,556
So who are you tracking?

795
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,691
I'm just kidding,
obviously.

796
00:42:33,726 --> 00:42:34,859
I don't want
to invade your privacy.

797
00:42:34,893 --> 00:42:36,027
I just want to see
if you need anything.

798
00:42:36,061 --> 00:42:37,729
No, I'm good.

799
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:40,031
Okay.

800
00:42:40,065 --> 00:42:42,433
Jake.

801
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:49,273
I know I can be
kind of a dick sometimes.

802
00:42:49,308 --> 00:42:51,943
You don't deserve that.

803
00:42:51,977 --> 00:42:53,578
It's okay,
most people think

804
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,947
I'm a dick too,
so I guess we're even.

805
00:42:55,981 --> 00:42:59,150
This past year
hasn't been my best.

806
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:01,819
The truth is,
I wouldn't be surviving it

807
00:43:01,854 --> 00:43:05,990
if it weren't for you,
so thank you.

808
00:43:06,025 --> 00:43:08,159
You're welcome.

809
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:28,613
Dexter?

810
00:43:35,521 --> 00:43:37,221
Come on, what the fuck?
Dexter!

811
00:43:37,256 --> 00:43:40,725
It looks
like he's not home.

812
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,367
Can I give him
a message?

813
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:52,904
Yeah.
Fuck him.

814
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:03,815
Hey, babe.

815
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,583
Good hunting?

816
00:44:05,617 --> 00:44:06,884
Yeah, I found
a couple dresses.

817
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:08,820
I think
you'll really like them.

818
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,488
Nice.

819
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:14,125
I'm guessing today's shopping
went better than yesterday's.

820
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:16,360
- About the same.
- Really?

821
00:44:16,395 --> 00:44:18,529
That's surprising,
considering there probably isn't

822
00:44:18,564 --> 00:44:23,167
much of a selection
at your old greenhouse.

823
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,936
What are you
talking about?

824
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:29,273
You were
with your friend...

825
00:44:29,308 --> 00:44:31,109
Dexter Morgan.

826
00:44:33,445 --> 00:44:35,847
Well, he a--
he asked to see me.

827
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,849
He wanted to make sure
that I was all right

828
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,517
after you confronted him,

829
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,619
and I told him
that everything was fine,

830
00:44:41,653 --> 00:44:43,554
that we were
very happy together,

831
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:44,689
end of story.

832
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,891
Don't lie to me.
I know the truth.

833
00:44:46,925 --> 00:44:49,227
Oh, Miles, I told you,
I don't care about him anymore.

834
00:44:49,261 --> 00:44:50,895
So you won't be
too upset then.

835
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:52,096
About what?

836
00:44:52,131 --> 00:44:53,898
About what
yesterday's excursion

837
00:44:53,932 --> 00:44:55,133
is going
to cost your friend.

838
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,767
Miles,
that's unnecessary.

839
00:44:56,802 --> 00:45:00,004
- You've made it necessary.
- No, please, don't hurt him.

840
00:45:00,038 --> 00:45:01,873
"Don't hurt him"?
Why, because you love him?

841
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,040
No, I promise you.

842
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,876
I'm not ever gonna
see him again.

843
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,210
He's the reason
you insisted...

844
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,478
- Stop it.
- On coming with me to Miami,

845
00:45:07,513 --> 00:45:08,946
returning to a place where...

846
00:45:08,981 --> 00:45:10,314
- Ouch!
- You're a wanted criminal.

847
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:11,716
Miles, ow!

848
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,752
He's the unfinished business
you mentioned.

849
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:21,859
I want you to know
I forgive you.

850
00:45:21,894 --> 00:45:23,294
We're going
to make a new beginning.

851
00:45:23,328 --> 00:45:25,062
I've already told the crew
we're leaving tonight.

852
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,465
We'll sail up the coast,
then cross the Atlantic,

853
00:45:27,499 --> 00:45:30,234
just the two of us,
for the rest of our lives.

854
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,869
That's how much
I care about you.

855
00:45:31,904 --> 00:45:33,171
No, Miles.
Stop it, please.

856
00:45:33,205 --> 00:45:35,339
You'll never have
to leave this boat.

857
00:45:35,374 --> 00:45:37,508
Stop

858
00:45:38,844 --> 00:45:42,113
I've given you everything!
You belong to me.

859
00:45:42,147 --> 00:45:44,982
No, stop it.
Get off me!

860
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,158
I-I tried to run,

861
00:46:27,192 --> 00:46:28,859
but...

862
00:46:28,894 --> 00:46:30,962
He just grabbed me.

863
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:38,803
I didn't mean for it
to happen this way.

864
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:42,673
Are you hurt?

865
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:45,009
I'm okay.

866
00:46:48,447 --> 00:46:50,615
We need bleach, bags,

867
00:46:50,649 --> 00:46:53,150
something to cut with--

868
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:56,487
an Axe or a saw
or something like that.

869
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:58,923
You think
you can get me those things

870
00:46:58,957 --> 00:47:01,926
without letting the crew know
that anything's wrong?

871
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:06,664
Yeah, I think so.
Yes.

872
00:47:08,233 --> 00:47:12,670
Wait, you need
to change.

873
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,672
- All right.
- Hannah.

874
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:21,746
It's gonna be okay.

875
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,749
I'll take care
of everything.

876
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:33,624
I believe you.

877
00:47:50,108 --> 00:47:54,412
So that's how
you make people disappear.

878
00:47:54,446 --> 00:47:57,948
Give or take a plastic room
and a kill table, yeah.

879
00:47:57,983 --> 00:48:01,085
Yeah, I remember
that part.

880
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:25,976
Do you ever wish
that you had followed through?

881
00:48:26,011 --> 00:48:28,713
With killing me?

882
00:48:30,315 --> 00:48:33,384
No.

883
00:48:35,687 --> 00:48:38,456
Ever wish you had?

884
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:42,126
I was never going
to kill you, Dexter.

885
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,930
It's just--

886
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,499
well, I knew I couldn't
live with Miles for much longer,

887
00:48:48,533 --> 00:48:51,936
and...

888
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,339
Unlike you, I don't
actually enjoy any of this.

889
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,244
So what's next?

890
00:49:00,278 --> 00:49:04,181
I told the crew
that Miles was going

891
00:49:04,216 --> 00:49:05,449
to New York
for a few days,

892
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:08,252
so that should
buy me some time.

893
00:49:20,966 --> 00:49:24,268
What's wrong?

894
00:49:24,302 --> 00:49:27,371
I have to go
to a crime scene...

895
00:49:27,406 --> 00:49:28,773
At my apartment building.

896
00:49:28,807 --> 00:49:31,609
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

897
00:49:31,643 --> 00:49:33,711
I have to go.

898
00:49:35,947 --> 00:49:39,383
Please don't leave town
before we talk again.

899
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,022
I won't.

900
00:50:06,011 --> 00:50:09,013
This could be
my apartment.

901
00:50:24,996 --> 00:50:26,997
Cassie.

902
00:50:28,133 --> 00:50:31,535
Dexter?

903
00:50:34,506 --> 00:50:37,575
W-what happened?

904
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:39,944
I don't know.
I just got here.

905
00:50:39,978 --> 00:50:41,712
Cassie and I,

906
00:50:41,746 --> 00:50:45,182
we were supposed
to have a date tonight.

907
00:50:45,217 --> 00:50:46,383
I'm sorry.

908
00:50:50,856 --> 00:50:53,390
I know you were friends.
You okay to work this?

909
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,626
Yeah.
Yeah.

910
00:50:59,998 --> 00:51:03,067
What do you see?

911
00:51:04,836 --> 00:51:07,204
She was bludgeoned.

912
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:08,405
See those marks
on her neck?

913
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,574
Someone held her down
and beat her to death.

914
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,409
God.

915
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,018
Norma Rivera
was bludgeoned.

916
00:51:21,052 --> 00:51:22,887
Is it possible
Zach did this

917
00:51:22,921 --> 00:51:25,923
when I was
with Hannah?

918
00:51:26,925 --> 00:51:28,659
Harry was
a good teacher to me

919
00:51:28,693 --> 00:51:32,663
because he
was normal, human.

920
00:51:32,697 --> 00:51:34,498
But can anything good come

921
00:51:34,533 --> 00:51:37,735
from putting
two killers together,

922
00:51:37,769 --> 00:51:39,503
whether it be
student and teacher

923
00:51:39,538 --> 00:51:44,308
or whatever
Hannah and I have?

924
00:51:44,342 --> 00:51:47,545
Or will it always end
the same way,

925
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:49,747
like this?

926
00:51:49,772 --> 00:51:54,772
