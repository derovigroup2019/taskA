00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:43,621
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

4
00:01:43,656 --> 00:01:46,491
Harrison and I are
leaving Miami with Hannah.

5
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:48,026
You act like
this doesn't even affect me.

6
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,427
You can visit.

7
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:51,763
Okay, I'll look you up
the next time I'm in Argentina.

8
00:01:51,797 --> 00:01:54,966
So you any closer
in your search for Saxon?

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,402
I wish we could just leave.

10
00:01:57,436 --> 00:01:59,003
I still have feelings
for you.

11
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:00,805
I used to feel like something
was holding me back.

12
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:04,242
- Now?
- Now, I--

13
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:06,444
I want you to help me
like you helped Dexter.

14
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:07,679
I'll find a way.

15
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:09,347
What about Dexter?
He's still after me.

16
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:10,615
I'll talk to Dexter.

17
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,250
You don't think
he likes killing.

18
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:14,819
Let me show you how much
he doesn't like killing.

19
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:16,654
No!

20
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:19,157
That's Zach's head
he's sawing into.

21
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:21,259
I'd actually like to be
a part of the team on this one.

22
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:22,827
Thanks,
but the Marshal service

23
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:24,295
doesn't really
take on partners.

24
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,130
You looking
for a new forensic tech?

25
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:28,499
- Dexter's moving on.
- Really?

26
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:31,369
It just struck me as odd
that he's leaving town

27
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:32,704
at the exact same time

28
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:34,172
Hannah McKay
is rumored to be here.

29
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:35,707
If Dexter were dating
Hannah McKay,

30
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:37,108
I would fucking know
about it.

31
00:02:37,142 --> 00:02:39,711
Deputy Marshal Clayton
thinks Dexter's hiding you.

32
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:41,679
Oh, God.

33
00:02:41,714 --> 00:02:43,581
- What happened?
- He fell and hit his chin.

34
00:02:43,615 --> 00:02:47,185
It's a pretty deep cut.
It won't stop bleeding.

35
00:02:48,487 --> 00:02:51,689
Hello, Dexter.
Mother chose the wrong son.

36
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:59,097
Evelyn?

37
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,468
Oh, no, no, no.

38
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:24,055
Vogel warned me I've been
straddling two worlds,

39
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:26,524
and I ignored her.

40
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:30,361
For that, she paid the price
with her life.

41
00:03:31,597 --> 00:03:35,299
Now, I have to remove myself
from her life.

42
00:03:58,957 --> 00:04:01,426
I never imagined
the last homicide I'd work

43
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,529
would be one
I'm now a part of.

44
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:07,999
I have to call this in.

45
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:12,637
I can't be seen leaving
the scene of the crime.

46
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:24,749
The last time I was in a pool
of my mother's blood,

47
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:27,418
I was too young to do anything
about it,

48
00:04:27,453 --> 00:04:29,153
but I'm no longer
a child.

49
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:37,261
She didn't say
why she wanted me to stop by.

50
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:38,496
The two of you
are friends?

51
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,665
Your father knew her, right?

52
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:43,534
Yeah, she reached out
to both Deb and me.

53
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:45,069
She was a good person.

54
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:47,338
So you pull up
to the house.

55
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:48,539
You see the door
kicked in...

56
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:50,541
And I ran in.
That's when I found her.

57
00:04:50,576 --> 00:04:53,111
You moved the body?

58
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:55,046
Yes.

59
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,049
I tried to stem the bleeding,
but she was already gone.

60
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,750
Did you see
anybody suspicious?

61
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:01,853
Miller was talking
to the neighbors.

62
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:04,555
One of them saw a white male
in his 40s take off

63
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,425
in a white or gray pickup.

64
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,393
- Which is it?
- It was dark.

65
00:05:09,428 --> 00:05:12,663
That's the best
they could make out.

66
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:15,433
Give Miller a hand,
and canvass the whole block.

67
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:17,201
Updates every half hour.

68
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:19,003
The media's gonna be
all over this.

69
00:05:19,037 --> 00:05:20,605
Okay.

70
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,473
- You should go.
- No, I can help.

71
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:24,075
Dex.

72
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:25,810
As much as I could use
the hand,

73
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:27,178
a defense attorney
would have a field day

74
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:30,181
with a forensic tech
who not only found a murder

75
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:32,283
but knew the victim
and then worked it.

76
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:36,654
We gotta protect
the case here.

77
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:39,590
So I'll see you
first thing in the morning.

78
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,125
Last day on the job.

79
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,127
Last day.

80
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:44,562
I should--
go.

81
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:46,097
We got this.
All right.

82
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:49,467
Saxon may have a head start,
but I intend to catch up.

83
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:57,975
Jesus, what are you doing here
so early?

84
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,777
Is Harrison with Hannah?

85
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:01,679
Yeah, she's helping him
get dressed in my room.

86
00:06:01,713 --> 00:06:03,414
That kid wakes
before the fucking sun.

87
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:10,154
You all right?

88
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:12,890
Evelyn's dead.

89
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:16,294
Saxon killed her last night
in front of me.

90
00:06:16,328 --> 00:06:18,930
He got away.

91
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:20,031
Fuck.

92
00:06:20,065 --> 00:06:21,265
I wanted you to hear it
from me.

93
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,401
Miami Metro
is working the case.

94
00:06:23,435 --> 00:06:26,003
It's all over the news.

95
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:28,940
Jesus Christ.
You all right?

96
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:36,113
Evelyn was...

97
00:06:36,148 --> 00:06:38,149
I know.

98
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:41,185
If it weren't for her--

99
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,123
We might not have found
our way back to each other.

100
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:51,162
If Saxon's out there,

101
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:55,199
Harrison needs to be
with Jamie.

102
00:06:55,234 --> 00:06:57,902
She's back at Batista's.
He'll be safe there.

103
00:06:57,936 --> 00:07:01,205
Are you gonna go
after Saxon?

104
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,507
Yes.

105
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:06,544
Then I will too.
I'll call Batista.

106
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:09,146
I'll go back to work today.

107
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:11,048
She was important
to me too, Dex.

108
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,750
Deb, you're putting yourself
in the same position

109
00:07:12,784 --> 00:07:13,985
you've been trying
to avoid.

110
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,387
Understand this:
If I get Saxon my way,

111
00:07:16,421 --> 00:07:19,590
I'm not handing him
over to you.

112
00:07:22,594 --> 00:07:25,363
Daddy, I combed
my hair.

113
00:07:25,397 --> 00:07:26,364
Wow.

114
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:28,199
I see that.

115
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:29,634
He insisted.

116
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:31,936
I think Jamie's gonna be
really impressed with that.

117
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,170
You should go grab
your backpack.

118
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:34,705
She's waiting for us
back at the apartment.

119
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,907
I'll help you.

120
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:41,679
Don't tell her
I already had a doughnut.

121
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:46,284
- What's this?
- I booked our itinerary.

122
00:07:46,318 --> 00:07:47,485
The three of us
fly to Rio.

123
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,586
When we get
to South America,

124
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,689
we catch a flight
to Buenos Aires.

125
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:53,557
And no one can trace us.

126
00:07:53,592 --> 00:07:57,228
That's still
the plan, right?

127
00:07:57,262 --> 00:07:58,729
Yeah.

128
00:07:58,764 --> 00:08:02,033
But, um...
What?

129
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:05,036
Dr. Vogel's dead.
Saxon killed her.

130
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,539
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.

131
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:10,341
This doesn't change anything
for us,

132
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,143
but I need to make sure
it's taken care of

133
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:13,377
before we leave.

134
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:17,214
You think you can
take care of it that fast?

135
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:19,283
Yes.

136
00:08:24,456 --> 00:08:26,891
Two days left in Miami.

137
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:29,527
Two days to find Saxon.

138
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:31,962
Two days until I start
a new life with Hannah.

139
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:33,497
Good news.

140
00:08:33,532 --> 00:08:35,533
I already have five people
coming by

141
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:36,934
to see your place today.

142
00:08:36,968 --> 00:08:39,236
Wow.
That was fast.

143
00:08:39,271 --> 00:08:40,271
Market's coming back.

144
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:42,440
And with a location
like yours,

145
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:45,509
I wouldn't be surprised
if we end up with five offers.

146
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:47,011
I really appreciate
you taking the listing

147
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:49,480
on such short notice, Syl.
Course.

148
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:52,183
I was happy to get the call.

149
00:08:52,217 --> 00:08:55,386
Oh, Harrison's gotten
so big.

150
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,388
Yeah.

151
00:08:58,957 --> 00:09:01,525
So why the sudden move?

152
00:09:05,397 --> 00:09:07,765
Too many memories.

153
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,433
Mm, I understand.

154
00:09:09,468 --> 00:09:12,737
After Miguel...

155
00:09:12,771 --> 00:09:13,804
I downsized.

156
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,873
Focused on the kids.

157
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:20,344
Oh, make that six people
coming by.

158
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:22,012
I should take this.

159
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:24,014
Okay.

160
00:09:29,388 --> 00:09:31,822
You put monkey
in a box.

161
00:09:31,857 --> 00:09:33,891
Oh, sorry about that.

162
00:09:33,925 --> 00:09:36,327
God, seeing your place
all boxed up

163
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:39,296
is making this so real.

164
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:40,831
Hmm.

165
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:43,200
You guys are really going.

166
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:45,636
Harrison is gonna
miss you.

167
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,305
Monkey's gonna
miss you too.

168
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,841
Hey, what don't you take
Harrison overnight?

169
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:52,410
Deb's place is so cramped,

170
00:09:52,444 --> 00:09:53,978
and people are gonna be
in and out of here.

171
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:55,646
And that way, you can--

172
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,915
Hug my favorite person
in the whole wide world

173
00:09:57,949 --> 00:09:59,250
all night long!

174
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:00,951
Stop!

175
00:10:00,986 --> 00:10:04,021
All right.

176
00:10:06,124 --> 00:10:08,459
- This one.
- This one, oh.

177
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:11,595
Oh, yeah.
Looks pretty.

178
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,166
Um, I'd like to get her inland
before Laura hits.

179
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,567
Laura?

180
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:18,102
Tropical storm Laura.

181
00:10:18,136 --> 00:10:21,138
They say she'll make landfall
in a few days.

182
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:23,507
Ah.

183
00:10:26,111 --> 00:10:29,547
She's a 2001 Century 2901
center console.

184
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:31,949
I had this custom rail
put in.

185
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:33,884
New paint.

186
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,353
Has a radar, GPS,

187
00:10:36,388 --> 00:10:38,489
fish-finder, autopilot,

188
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:40,558
emergency life raft.

189
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:45,362
And I had these twin Yamaha 250
four stroke motors put in.

190
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:47,498
They got
just over 400 hours,

191
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:52,803
and when you open them up
and you're out there...

192
00:10:52,838 --> 00:10:53,904
There's nothing like it.

193
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:54,905
Check it out.

194
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,740
Eh.

195
00:10:56,775 --> 00:11:00,678
Hoping she'd have
a bigger beer cooler.

196
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:06,283
Maybe she's not
the boat for you.

197
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:14,925
Saxon moves
from city to city,

198
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,393
but his job
never changes.

199
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:19,330
He inspects buildings.
It's a place to start.

200
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:22,533
Good morning.

201
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:24,068
Easy for you to say.

202
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:25,870
You didn't spend the whole night
scouring Vogel's place

203
00:11:25,904 --> 00:11:28,539
with nothing to show for it
except a big, fat goose egg.

204
00:11:28,573 --> 00:11:30,174
Nothing?

205
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,376
See for yourself.

206
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:38,782
No prints, no trace.

207
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:40,584
Oh, man, I could go
for some hookers

208
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:41,886
and some blow right now.

209
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,221
But since this
isn't the '90s,

210
00:11:44,256 --> 00:11:45,523
caffeine it is.

211
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:46,524
Want anything?

212
00:11:46,558 --> 00:11:48,692
No, I'm good.

213
00:11:55,534 --> 00:11:57,468
This hospital,
closed for years.

214
00:11:57,502 --> 00:12:00,437
Saxon issued
a demolition permit,

215
00:12:00,472 --> 00:12:01,772
but it's still standing.

216
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:04,008
The perfect place to cut

217
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:05,643
into your victims' skulls.

218
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:10,214
Hey, Dexter,
Quinn is looking for you.

219
00:12:11,383 --> 00:12:13,217
- Because?
- Oh, yeah.

220
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:16,053
Uh, the swab thing
in the interrogation room.

221
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:18,389
Okay.

222
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:25,696
Dex, come in.

223
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:29,300
Hi, Dexter.

224
00:12:32,304 --> 00:12:35,906
He came in to clear his name
on the Cassie case.

225
00:12:35,941 --> 00:12:37,474
I see.

226
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:40,511
I had no idea
I was a suspect.

227
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:43,948
We got to your apartment,
and it was totally cleaned out.

228
00:12:43,982 --> 00:12:48,085
You can appreciate
how that looks.

229
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:50,321
I couldn't stay
at my old place.

230
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:53,791
I spent so much time there
with Cassie.

231
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:58,262
Everywhere I looked,
something reminded me of her.

232
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:00,030
You can understand that.

233
00:13:00,065 --> 00:13:03,534
You knew Cassie.
She was a great person.

234
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:07,037
Yes, she was.

235
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:09,473
For a while, uh...

236
00:13:09,507 --> 00:13:12,943
I was even thinking
of leaving Miami.

237
00:13:12,978 --> 00:13:16,380
But my business is here,

238
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:19,450
my friends, family.

239
00:13:21,753 --> 00:13:24,622
When I heard there was
an alert out for me, I...

240
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:28,792
I couldn't believe it.

241
00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:31,028
I thought we already
resolved this.

242
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:32,463
We appreciate you
coming in.

243
00:13:32,497 --> 00:13:34,665
Like you said,
I just wanna clear my name.

244
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:35,833
Good.

245
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:38,302
This will help
towards that.

246
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:40,037
What's this?

247
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:42,139
- DNA sample.
- Is that really necessary?

248
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:44,041
You said you wanted
to cooperate.

249
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:45,409
Open.

250
00:13:58,723 --> 00:14:01,692
Thanks.
We're done here for now.

251
00:14:06,665 --> 00:14:09,033
Hey, you plan
on any more moves...

252
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:10,601
I'll be sure
to let you know.

253
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:12,202
Good.

254
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:26,684
Saxon was just here,

255
00:14:26,718 --> 00:14:28,752
trying to clear his name
for Cassie's murder.

256
00:14:28,787 --> 00:14:31,655
He had an answer for everything
Quinn threw at him.

257
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,124
Well, he's got balls,
I'll give him that.

258
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,760
Masuka find anything to tie him
to Vogel's crime scene?

259
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:39,129
He came up empty, but...

260
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:40,330
What?

261
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:43,333
- Saxon agreed to a standard.
- Well, so what?

262
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:47,171
It's not gonna tie him
to Cassie's murder.

263
00:14:48,606 --> 00:14:50,474
But it'll give us
a matri-fucking-lineal match

264
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:51,975
to his mother.

265
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,610
Yeah, suddenly he's no longer
Oliver Saxon.

266
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:56,380
He's Daniel Vogel,
Dr. Vogel's psychopathic son

267
00:14:56,414 --> 00:14:59,316
who died in a fire
at a psychiatric hospital.

268
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,286
Let him try to explain that
away with my boot up his ass.

269
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:08,726
Let me ask you a question.

270
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,663
Why are you helping us
get Saxon?

271
00:15:12,697 --> 00:15:14,298
Don't you want him
for yourself?

272
00:15:14,332 --> 00:15:17,935
I just want him
taken care of.

273
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:23,249
Well, that's new
coming from you.

274
00:15:24,685 --> 00:15:26,686
I'm gonna go
get started on this.

275
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:29,889
I'm gonna go find
some pens.

276
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:45,538
Hi.

277
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:48,375
The thin mints
are in the bottom drawer.

278
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:50,143
It takes supply requisition,

279
00:15:50,177 --> 00:15:52,045
like, a week
to come through, so...

280
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,046
- Right.
- You mind?

281
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,748
By all means, go ahead.

282
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:57,017
Thanks.

283
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:05,558
What the fuck is this?

284
00:16:07,695 --> 00:16:10,497
Uh, I kept it around
just in case I decided

285
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:12,599
to marry somebody else
from work.

286
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:17,604
You've had this in here
the whole time?

287
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:25,111
Keep my stapler
away from Soderquist.

288
00:16:25,146 --> 00:16:27,280
Guy's a fucking klepto.

289
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,937
Is this old hospital
Saxon's private sanitarium?

290
00:18:12,786 --> 00:18:15,388
Saxon's kill room.

291
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:19,926
Zach died here.

292
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,896
And who knows
how many others?

293
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,965
Doesn't look like
Saxon's been living here.

294
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,734
But he'll be back.

295
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:29,769
This is clearly
a special place for him.

296
00:18:29,803 --> 00:18:32,205
You can stake out the building,
wait for him.

297
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:34,073
I don't have time
to wait.

298
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:36,075
Hannah and I
don't have time to wait.

299
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,012
I want him dead.
By your hand.

300
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:41,381
Anyone's hand,
as long as he's dead.

301
00:18:41,415 --> 00:18:45,718
That doesn't sound
like the old Dexter.

302
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:48,655
Maybe I'm not
the old Dexter.

303
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:12,946
Everything Saxon downloaded
about me from Vogel's computer

304
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,748
is on this.

305
00:19:22,423 --> 00:19:25,525
He recorded all his kills.

306
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,193
They're all here.

307
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:31,965
But you still don't know
where he is.

308
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:35,301
Maybe this is exactly
what I need.

309
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:37,604
I can bring him to me.

310
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:39,906
Hey.

311
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,542
You, uh,
calling it quits soon?

312
00:19:42,576 --> 00:19:44,177
Yeah, I will soon.

313
00:19:44,211 --> 00:19:46,446
I just wanna get up to speed
on a couple things.

314
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,481
You going to
Dr. Vogel's memorial tomorrow?

315
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:50,016
I know she helped you
get through a lot.

316
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,553
- Yeah, I'll be there.
- Need a ride, let me know.

317
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:02,095
Swung by Elway's.

318
00:20:02,129 --> 00:20:04,497
He said you were back
on the force.

319
00:20:04,531 --> 00:20:06,799
Yeah.
It's my first day back.

320
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,368
I'm kinda swamped.

321
00:20:08,402 --> 00:20:09,502
What can I help you with,
Deputy Marshal?

322
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:10,670
Well, I was hoping
you could possibly

323
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:12,038
clear something up for me.

324
00:20:12,072 --> 00:20:13,406
I'm just following up
on a lead.

325
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,407
Shoot.

326
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:15,642
Okay, seems like
a blonde woman

327
00:20:15,676 --> 00:20:17,176
matching
Hanna McKay's description

328
00:20:17,211 --> 00:20:18,778
walked into urgent care

329
00:20:18,812 --> 00:20:20,813
with a young boy
named Harrison Morgan,

330
00:20:20,848 --> 00:20:22,482
said she was his mother.

331
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:25,952
The weird part is,
she gave your name and address.

332
00:20:28,022 --> 00:20:29,622
My nephew's
been staying with me

333
00:20:29,657 --> 00:20:31,958
since Dexter put his condo
on the market.

334
00:20:31,992 --> 00:20:33,293
He busted his chin,

335
00:20:33,327 --> 00:20:35,828
and I took him in
to get him stitched up.

336
00:20:35,863 --> 00:20:37,997
So you took him
to urgent care?

337
00:20:38,032 --> 00:20:40,099
I told the woman at the desk
that I was his aunt,

338
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:41,501
but maybe
she didn't hear me.

339
00:20:41,535 --> 00:20:44,070
Still, she looked right
at my photo of Hannah McKay

340
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:45,672
and swore
that's who brought him in.

341
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:48,007
Well, then she needs to get
her fucking eyes checked,

342
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:52,545
'cause I haven't been blonde
since a very bad freshman year.

343
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:53,713
Right, okay.

344
00:20:53,747 --> 00:20:55,481
Well, look,
you know what it's like.

345
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:57,817
I gotta check out all the leads,
even the crazy ones, right?

346
00:20:57,851 --> 00:20:59,986
Sure.

347
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,854
All right,
welcome back, Detective.

348
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:02,989
I'll be in touch.

349
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:05,325
I'll be here.

350
00:21:15,936 --> 00:21:17,136
Not much of a turnout.

351
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:18,805
I guess she didn't have
many family or friends.

352
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,374
Yeah, just the son
who slit her throat.

353
00:21:21,408 --> 00:21:23,409
Think Saxon's watching?

354
00:21:23,444 --> 00:21:25,445
I would be.

355
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:28,815
Thank you, everyone,
for coming.

356
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:33,119
I know most of you didn't know
Evelyn very well, but...

357
00:21:33,153 --> 00:21:35,988
- It was a nice service.
- Yeah.

358
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:38,024
It's important to remember
those no longer with us.

359
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:40,126
Yeah.

360
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,529
Now who wants a drink?

361
00:21:51,672 --> 00:21:54,474
Christ.
I'll be right back.

362
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:07,353
You know they're really
gonna miss you, right?

363
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:09,555
I know.

364
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,957
Maybe you should
go in there

365
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:13,459
and pretend you're gonna
miss them too.

366
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:16,529
It's your last day,
you know?

367
00:22:16,563 --> 00:22:18,197
It's no longer pretend.

368
00:22:18,232 --> 00:22:22,034
Well, gain a Morgan,
lose a Morgan.

369
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:24,771
Harry would have been proud
of the two of you.

370
00:22:24,805 --> 00:22:27,206
Thank you, sir.

371
00:22:27,241 --> 00:22:32,712
I want you to know both of you
have been like family to me.

372
00:22:32,746 --> 00:22:34,547
And, Dexter,
if you ever need anything

373
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:37,049
or decide
you wanna come back,

374
00:22:37,084 --> 00:22:38,785
this will always be
your home.

375
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:42,054
I appreciate that.

376
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:44,223
So let me buy you
another round.

377
00:22:44,258 --> 00:22:45,792
I should
probably get going.

378
00:22:45,826 --> 00:22:47,493
Oh, nonsense.

379
00:22:47,528 --> 00:22:49,695
For the next six hours,
you're still working for me.

380
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,898
You're not going anywhere.
That's an order.

381
00:22:51,932 --> 00:22:53,199
Come on.

382
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:56,702
Okay, Missy,
what's your poison?

383
00:22:56,737 --> 00:22:59,071
I'll have a diet coke.

384
00:22:59,106 --> 00:23:01,107
A beer for me.
Thanks.

385
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:05,211
Well, that's--
that's a little tame.

386
00:23:05,245 --> 00:23:07,447
Really?
Are you gonna go there?

387
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:09,415
Well,
if you put it that way, no.

388
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,970
Okay, you were, like,
all up in my shit

389
00:23:10,984 --> 00:23:12,151
about a bong rip,

390
00:23:12,186 --> 00:23:13,653
but I don't know
if you've noticed,

391
00:23:13,687 --> 00:23:15,421
but we're in a bar.

392
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,523
Look, I'm sorry
about the whole pot thing.

393
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:19,091
You know, this whole
father-daughter thing

394
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:22,261
is still kind of new,
you know?

395
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:24,564
Yeah, I know.
It's cool.

396
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:27,500
Everybody's really excited

397
00:23:27,534 --> 00:23:31,170
about your sister
being back on the force.

398
00:23:31,205 --> 00:23:33,973
Yeah, she told me
that you two might be

399
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:35,908
back in each other's lives.

400
00:23:35,943 --> 00:23:38,478
You okay with that?

401
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,447
Deb likes you,

402
00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:45,051
and with me gone...

403
00:23:45,085 --> 00:23:47,987
I don't want her
to be alone.

404
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:49,655
I want her to be
with someone

405
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,425
who makes her happy.

406
00:23:54,495 --> 00:23:58,197
That's all
I ever wanted to do.

407
00:23:58,232 --> 00:24:01,367
I'm okay with that.

408
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:08,207
I gotta take this.

409
00:24:08,242 --> 00:24:09,942
Hey, Syl, what's up?

410
00:24:09,977 --> 00:24:11,277
Dex, I'm so glad
I caught you.

411
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:12,712
Listen, I know
it's last-minute,

412
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:14,714
but I've got somebody
who wants to see the place,

413
00:24:14,748 --> 00:24:16,082
wants to meet the seller,

414
00:24:16,116 --> 00:24:20,853
and he's ready
to make an offer, cash.

415
00:24:20,888 --> 00:24:22,321
Give me half an hour.

416
00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:24,624
Perfect.

417
00:24:28,462 --> 00:24:31,497
You remember
the first case we worked?

418
00:24:31,532 --> 00:24:34,100
Uh, husband, wife,
lots of blood.

419
00:24:34,134 --> 00:24:36,068
I'd never seen
anything like it.

420
00:24:36,103 --> 00:24:37,136
The strings.

421
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,639
The look on your face.

422
00:24:39,673 --> 00:24:41,173
You were like
a pig in shit.

423
00:24:42,643 --> 00:24:44,610
Thanks, I think.

424
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,315
Not sure what this place
is gonna be like without you.

425
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:54,887
You're a good friend,
Angel.

426
00:24:54,922 --> 00:24:57,957
I'm glad to hear you
say that.

427
00:24:57,991 --> 00:24:59,759
So you'll forgive me
for this.

428
00:24:59,793 --> 00:25:00,860
All right, everybody!

429
00:25:00,894 --> 00:25:02,662
Everybody, come on,
gather around.

430
00:25:02,696 --> 00:25:03,763
Gather around.

431
00:25:03,797 --> 00:25:08,134
I know that this is
a solemn occasion.

432
00:25:08,168 --> 00:25:12,071
But since somebody didn't
let me throw him a party,

433
00:25:12,105 --> 00:25:15,708
let's let this be it.

434
00:25:15,742 --> 00:25:21,314
Dexter Morgan may be leaving
the Miami Metro <i>familia,</i>

435
00:25:21,348 --> 00:25:25,217
but he will always be
right here in our hearts.

436
00:25:25,252 --> 00:25:28,254
To Dexter.

437
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:32,959
We wish you and Harrison luck
in whatever comes next.

438
00:25:32,993 --> 00:25:33,960
To Dexter.

439
00:25:33,994 --> 00:25:35,227
- To Dexter.
- <i>Salud.</i>

440
00:25:35,262 --> 00:25:37,029
Thank you.

441
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:39,865
Thank you.

442
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,068
Um...

443
00:25:45,305 --> 00:25:48,374
I'll miss you guys too.

444
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,950
Dexter.

445
00:25:57,985 --> 00:26:00,519
This is Oliver Saxon.

446
00:26:00,554 --> 00:26:02,722
Again.

447
00:26:02,756 --> 00:26:04,523
He really responded
to the listing,

448
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:06,692
and he was hoping to take
a quick look at the place.

449
00:26:06,727 --> 00:26:07,727
Pleasure.

450
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:09,095
Likewise.

451
00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:10,663
You'll have
to excuse the mess.

452
00:26:10,697 --> 00:26:12,064
No problem.

453
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:13,933
They say that moving's
one of the big causes of stress.

454
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:15,034
Almost as much
as divorce.

455
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:17,570
And death.

456
00:26:17,604 --> 00:26:20,072
Why don't you follow me?

457
00:26:20,107 --> 00:26:22,475
So it's a one bedroom,
one bathroom,

458
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:23,709
but it has an attached--

459
00:26:23,744 --> 00:26:25,211
Actually, would you mind
if Dexter showed me?

460
00:26:25,245 --> 00:26:27,380
I like to hear directly
from the owner.

461
00:26:27,414 --> 00:26:30,549
No sales pitch.

462
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:31,984
Sure.

463
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:33,719
I have a few phone calls
to return.

464
00:26:33,754 --> 00:26:36,255
I'll be outside.

465
00:26:40,827 --> 00:26:43,863
I always did
like this place.

466
00:26:43,897 --> 00:26:45,564
You have the same view
of the water Cassie did.

467
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,633
What are you doing here?

468
00:26:47,668 --> 00:26:49,635
I have a proposal.

469
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,303
Figured the safest way
to deliver it

470
00:26:51,338 --> 00:26:53,939
was to bring a referee.

471
00:26:53,974 --> 00:26:56,075
I'm listening.

472
00:26:56,109 --> 00:26:58,344
We walk away.

473
00:26:58,378 --> 00:26:59,345
Walk away?

474
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:01,447
Both of us.

475
00:27:01,481 --> 00:27:03,315
From each other.

476
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,085
Go our separate paths,
live our separate lives.

477
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:08,654
I forget about you.

478
00:27:08,689 --> 00:27:11,490
You forget about me.

479
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:12,491
You went out of your way

480
00:27:12,526 --> 00:27:14,093
to kill your mother
in front of me,

481
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:16,228
and you just expect me
to forget?

482
00:27:16,263 --> 00:27:18,264
May have been
a little bit over the top,

483
00:27:18,298 --> 00:27:20,332
but I was only trying
to make a point.

484
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:23,302
I missed the point.

485
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:27,907
It was a test to see if,
given the chance,

486
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:30,009
she would finally
choose me.

487
00:27:30,043 --> 00:27:34,780
Well, we both know
how that turned out.

488
00:27:34,815 --> 00:27:37,683
Yeah, so naturally,
you had to cut her throat.

489
00:27:37,718 --> 00:27:39,852
You know what it's like.

490
00:27:39,886 --> 00:27:41,987
The kill.

491
00:27:42,022 --> 00:27:44,724
It can be...cathartic.

492
00:27:44,758 --> 00:27:46,759
And it was.

493
00:27:46,793 --> 00:27:49,328
That's why
I'm giving you a choice.

494
00:27:49,362 --> 00:27:52,531
Go on with your life,
or come after me.

495
00:27:54,234 --> 00:27:58,070
But choose poorly,
like mom,

496
00:27:58,105 --> 00:28:01,674
and you will lose.

497
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:04,477
You seem pretty sure
of yourself.

498
00:28:06,513 --> 00:28:10,449
You have a lot more
to lose than I do.

499
00:28:10,484 --> 00:28:13,385
You've created
the perfect cover life.

500
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,755
Cute little son,

501
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:16,922
your sister.

502
00:28:16,957 --> 00:28:19,892
Stepkids even.

503
00:28:19,926 --> 00:28:21,193
And now you have
a girlfriend.

504
00:28:21,228 --> 00:28:24,764
It's, um, Hannah, right?

505
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29,101
They're not a cover.
They're real to me.

506
00:28:29,136 --> 00:28:30,836
Something Saxon
can't understand.

507
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:34,306
All very lovely.

508
00:28:34,341 --> 00:28:38,410
And all very easy
to remove from your life.

509
00:28:38,445 --> 00:28:41,580
I mean, you've already had
one wife murdered.

510
00:28:41,615 --> 00:28:43,849
That must be
an interesting story.

511
00:28:47,254 --> 00:28:49,755
But it's gonna put you
in a very awkward position

512
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:54,293
if everyone else starts
disappearing from your life.

513
00:28:54,327 --> 00:28:57,029
The choice is yours.

514
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,372
Yeah, I think
I can live with that.

515
00:29:09,342 --> 00:29:10,976
I'll let Mrs. Prado know

516
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:14,013
I've put an offer
on the table.

517
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:21,020
He wants me to walk away

518
00:29:21,054 --> 00:29:25,191
without realizing he's just
reminded me why I can't.

519
00:29:27,027 --> 00:29:30,162
So...What's so urgent?

520
00:29:30,197 --> 00:29:32,164
I've got a line
on Hannah McKay,

521
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:34,900
but I'm gonna need your help
reeling her in.

522
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:36,256
I thought
you didn't want my help.

523
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:38,070
We've been looking
at the wrong Morgan.

524
00:29:38,104 --> 00:29:41,440
I think your former employee
has her holed up in her place.

525
00:29:41,474 --> 00:29:43,809
Deb is no fan of Hannah McKay.

526
00:29:43,844 --> 00:29:45,611
Yeah, but you said she'd
do anything for her brother.

527
00:29:45,645 --> 00:29:48,214
Helping McKay
is helping him.

528
00:29:48,248 --> 00:29:49,548
I just need you
to talk to her,

529
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:51,717
take a look around.

530
00:29:54,888 --> 00:29:56,522
Look, Deb and I
didn't exactly part

531
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:58,424
on the best of terms.

532
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,025
If you're still interested
in that reward,

533
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,828
I suggest you find a way
to patch things up with her.

534
00:30:10,971 --> 00:30:12,304
Hey.

535
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:14,974
Just trying to make our last
few days in Miami special,

536
00:30:15,008 --> 00:30:17,109
you know?

537
00:30:17,143 --> 00:30:19,612
I hope you like dolmas.

538
00:30:19,646 --> 00:30:22,281
I'm just trying
to keep myself busy.

539
00:30:22,315 --> 00:30:24,984
You should go on one of
those cooking shows, you know?

540
00:30:25,018 --> 00:30:28,120
The competition ones.
You'd win.

541
00:30:28,154 --> 00:30:30,022
Oh, I'd make sure
that I did.

542
00:30:37,898 --> 00:30:40,599
- It's Elway.
- Bedroom.

543
00:30:48,174 --> 00:30:49,508
What's up, elway?

544
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:52,244
Security left a couple
of your personal items

545
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:53,979
back in the office--

546
00:30:54,014 --> 00:30:55,514
just a couple pictures
and a hat.

547
00:30:55,548 --> 00:30:56,582
Oh, well, you didn't have

548
00:30:56,616 --> 00:30:57,583
to bring them
all the way over here.

549
00:30:57,617 --> 00:30:59,218
I could've picked them up.

550
00:30:59,252 --> 00:31:01,720
Well, I actually
wanted to talk to you.

551
00:31:01,755 --> 00:31:02,922
May I?

552
00:31:02,956 --> 00:31:04,557
Uh, actually now is not
a very good time.

553
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:06,558
Ah, it'll just take
a minute.

554
00:31:06,593 --> 00:31:09,194
I wanted to apologize
about the way I behaved

555
00:31:09,229 --> 00:31:10,863
when you left.

556
00:31:10,897 --> 00:31:12,331
Don't worry about it.

557
00:31:12,365 --> 00:31:14,300
No, no,
I was a real asshole.

558
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:15,868
I let my ego
get the best of me,

559
00:31:15,902 --> 00:31:17,937
and I certainly don't want
to leave it like that.

560
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:20,272
I--well, I want us
to be friends, you know?

561
00:31:20,307 --> 00:31:22,408
Great.
Well, then we're good.

562
00:31:22,442 --> 00:31:24,109
And who knows, you know,
now you're back on the force.

563
00:31:24,144 --> 00:31:26,645
Maybe you and I can do
each other the occasional favor.

564
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,514
Yeah, we'll keep in touch.

565
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:30,582
You, uh--

566
00:31:30,617 --> 00:31:32,184
you expecting company?

567
00:31:32,218 --> 00:31:33,352
I sure am,

568
00:31:33,386 --> 00:31:34,687
and I actually
need to get ready.

569
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:37,156
So...

570
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,490
Well, I guess
the police department

571
00:31:38,525 --> 00:31:40,159
is paying a lot better
than I remember, huh?

572
00:31:40,193 --> 00:31:42,294
Hey, Elway, I really
appreciate that apology,

573
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:43,729
but I've got a lot
of shit to do.

574
00:31:43,763 --> 00:31:45,731
So could you kindly get
the fuck out of my house?

575
00:31:45,765 --> 00:31:47,866
Yeah.

576
00:31:56,743 --> 00:31:59,244
He's gone,
but he's onto you.

577
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,579
Oh, shit.

578
00:32:00,613 --> 00:32:02,014
Which means the Deputy Marshal
won't be far behind.

579
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,048
You've gotta move fast.

580
00:32:09,489 --> 00:32:10,522
Hello?

581
00:32:10,557 --> 00:32:12,658
Dex, we have a problem.

582
00:32:12,692 --> 00:32:13,926
Elway was just here.

583
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,260
Elway?

584
00:32:15,295 --> 00:32:16,762
He acted like he was
dropping by to talk with Deb,

585
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:18,664
but she's pretty sure
that he was here looking for me.

586
00:32:18,698 --> 00:32:20,733
She thinks that he knows
that I'm here.

587
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:22,801
Stay there.

588
00:32:22,836 --> 00:32:24,770
Okay.

589
00:32:32,846 --> 00:32:34,146
I tried to get
an earlier flight,

590
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,248
but it's booked solid
'cause of the storm.

591
00:32:36,282 --> 00:32:38,050
I'm getting out of here
right now.

592
00:32:38,084 --> 00:32:39,118
She's gonna stay
at a hotel near the airport

593
00:32:39,152 --> 00:32:40,119
until your flight.

594
00:32:40,153 --> 00:32:41,820
Saxon came to my apartment.

595
00:32:41,855 --> 00:32:43,789
What? Why the fuck
didn't you call me?

596
00:32:43,823 --> 00:32:45,457
It happened very fast.

597
00:32:45,492 --> 00:32:47,426
He said he wanted
to offer me a truce.

598
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,594
A truce?

599
00:32:48,628 --> 00:32:50,062
Really it was just
a veiled threat.

600
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:53,499
He threatened you, Harrison,
Astor and Cody, and you.

601
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:55,467
I can handle
whatever he throws at me.

602
00:32:55,502 --> 00:32:57,669
You should go with Hannah.

603
00:32:57,704 --> 00:32:59,538
Yes, I deposited my money
into an offshore account.

604
00:32:59,572 --> 00:33:00,773
We can access it
immediately.

605
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:02,007
The fucking storm
that's coming

606
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:03,342
is gonna ground
all the flights.

607
00:33:03,376 --> 00:33:04,777
Saxon isn't gonna
follow us.

608
00:33:04,811 --> 00:33:07,346
What if he does?

609
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,347
I get it.

610
00:33:08,381 --> 00:33:09,515
I get that this is something

611
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:10,870
that you feel
like you have to do,

612
00:33:10,884 --> 00:33:11,917
that this is who you are,
but--

613
00:33:11,951 --> 00:33:13,118
It's not who I wanna be.

614
00:33:13,153 --> 00:33:15,454
I have to do this first.

615
00:33:15,488 --> 00:33:18,724
There's no other way.
I will be there.

616
00:33:31,137 --> 00:33:33,672
I guess this is good-bye.

617
00:33:33,706 --> 00:33:37,242
For now.

618
00:33:37,277 --> 00:33:41,580
I can't not see my brother
and my nephew.

619
00:33:41,614 --> 00:33:43,982
Now you're a part
of that package.

620
00:33:44,017 --> 00:33:48,353
Not anything
I ever saw coming.

621
00:33:48,388 --> 00:33:50,022
For what it's worth,
I think Dexter's

622
00:33:50,056 --> 00:33:51,990
making a huge mistake
going after Saxon.

623
00:33:52,025 --> 00:33:56,095
I think he should be here
with you now.

624
00:33:56,129 --> 00:33:58,464
Have you ever known him
to be able to walk away

625
00:33:58,498 --> 00:34:02,034
from something
once he's started it?

626
00:34:02,068 --> 00:34:05,270
That's life with Dexter.
That's who he is.

627
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:06,839
It's like having
a whole other person

628
00:34:06,873 --> 00:34:09,041
in the relationship.

629
00:34:09,075 --> 00:34:12,077
I must really love
this man.

630
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,281
Me too.

631
00:34:16,316 --> 00:34:18,517
Even when I don't want to.

632
00:34:21,421 --> 00:34:23,856
Take care of him.

633
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,091
Yeah, I will.

634
00:34:45,311 --> 00:34:48,080
Saxon wants to make Miami
his home.

635
00:34:48,114 --> 00:34:50,983
Little does he know
how hot the summers can get.

636
00:34:58,158 --> 00:35:00,125
And once everyone
sees the footage of him

637
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,227
as the brain surgeon,

638
00:35:02,262 --> 00:35:04,196
the heat will be unbearable.

639
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,965
You know, he's not just gonna
walk away from that.

640
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,567
Exactly.

641
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:10,869
I'm drawing him to me.

642
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:14,339
So I guess you're not gonna
accept his offer.

643
00:35:14,374 --> 00:35:15,741
You believe him,

644
00:35:15,775 --> 00:35:18,810
that he's willing
to disengage?

645
00:35:18,845 --> 00:35:21,013
You clearly don't.

646
00:35:21,047 --> 00:35:25,117
He came into my house
and threatened my family.

647
00:35:25,151 --> 00:35:29,955
Now you're sounding like
the old Dexter again.

648
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:32,124
No, this is
a different kind of kill.

649
00:35:32,158 --> 00:35:35,360
Dead is dead, Dex.

650
00:35:35,395 --> 00:35:37,496
It didn't used to matter
who was on my table,

651
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,698
as long as someone was,
but now--

652
00:35:40,232 --> 00:35:42,567
It's personal.

653
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:47,505
It's been personal
for a long time.

654
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,109
And that need
you used to feel?

655
00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:55,780
It's still there,
somewhere.

656
00:35:55,815 --> 00:35:58,316
But since Hannah
came into my life,

657
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:01,052
it's lessened.

658
00:36:01,087 --> 00:36:03,555
What I need...

659
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:06,224
Is her.

660
00:36:06,258 --> 00:36:11,029
So when you get to Argentina,
what happens?

661
00:36:11,063 --> 00:36:12,630
I don't know.

662
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:16,201
But I can't wait
to find out.

663
00:36:18,771 --> 00:36:20,538
Sorry.

664
00:36:20,573 --> 00:36:23,808
Dad said you were
waiting for this DNA stuff?

665
00:36:23,843 --> 00:36:25,477
Tell your dad thanks.

666
00:36:25,511 --> 00:36:27,679
It's so weird
Masuka's your father.

667
00:36:27,713 --> 00:36:29,814
Weird awesome.

668
00:36:32,084 --> 00:36:35,186
You're not gonna fucking
believe this.

669
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:38,656
Saxon is related to Vogel.
He's her son.

670
00:36:38,691 --> 00:36:41,025
You're kidding me.

671
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,727
I thought all her family
was dead.

672
00:36:42,762 --> 00:36:46,831
You think this fucker killed
his mother along with Cassie?

673
00:36:51,337 --> 00:36:52,637
What are you doing here?

674
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:55,440
Starving.

675
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:57,108
Saxon's DNA came back,

676
00:36:57,143 --> 00:36:59,744
so they put out a warrant
for his arrest.

677
00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:02,981
Miami Metro knows
that Saxon is Vogel's son,

678
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:05,884
and Elway and Clayton
have no idea where Hannah is.

679
00:37:05,918 --> 00:37:07,552
This is your last night
in Miami,

680
00:37:07,586 --> 00:37:10,421
and we are having
dinner together.

681
00:37:10,456 --> 00:37:12,690
Even though you've already
packed up your fucking kitchen.

682
00:37:12,725 --> 00:37:14,726
You wanna help me find
a plate and some pans?

683
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,661
I'm really not hungry.

684
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:17,862
Dexter, the next time
we do this,

685
00:37:17,897 --> 00:37:20,198
it's gonna be
fucking tacos and Tequila.

686
00:37:20,232 --> 00:37:22,500
Or whatever the fuck they eat
in Argentina.

687
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:23,902
Yeah,
it'll probably be steaks.

688
00:37:23,936 --> 00:37:26,237
It's Argentina,
not Mexico.

689
00:37:26,272 --> 00:37:28,206
Deb, you shouldn't be here.

690
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,274
Bullshit.

691
00:37:29,308 --> 00:37:30,475
Do you remember
where you put the pans?

692
00:37:30,509 --> 00:37:34,012
Listen to me,
you can't be here.

693
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:35,013
Why?

694
00:37:37,783 --> 00:37:39,284
What the fuck is going on?

695
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:41,586
I'm expecting company.

696
00:37:44,657 --> 00:37:46,624
Saxon.

697
00:37:47,793 --> 00:37:49,260
Just leave him to me.

698
00:37:49,295 --> 00:37:51,663
And I mean leave.

699
00:37:51,697 --> 00:37:53,264
After everything
you've been through,

700
00:37:53,299 --> 00:37:54,933
I don't want--
listen to me.

701
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:58,570
Nothing,
and I mean nothing,

702
00:37:58,604 --> 00:37:59,838
is gonna stand in the way

703
00:37:59,872 --> 00:38:02,807
of me having one more night
with my brother.

704
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:09,814
Now are you gonna help me find
the fucking skillet or what?

705
00:38:32,471 --> 00:38:34,272
This place
has been wiped clean.

706
00:38:34,306 --> 00:38:36,608
Almost clean.
Look at this.

707
00:38:36,642 --> 00:38:38,476
The last site someone
visited on this computer

708
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,378
was for an Aero Sudamerica.

709
00:38:40,412 --> 00:38:43,481
Any specific details?
Did she book a flight?

710
00:38:43,515 --> 00:38:45,183
If she did,
it's not here.

711
00:38:45,217 --> 00:38:46,517
But I'll tell you
what I can do.

712
00:38:46,552 --> 00:38:47,785
I can access the manifests

713
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,120
for the flights
in the next few days,

714
00:38:49,154 --> 00:38:51,122
then cross-check those names
with passport photos.

715
00:38:51,156 --> 00:38:52,557
Not exactly legal.

716
00:38:52,591 --> 00:38:54,058
Okay, are you saying
don't do it?

717
00:38:54,093 --> 00:38:55,426
I'm not saying anything.

718
00:38:55,461 --> 00:38:57,061
But while you do
whatever it is you're gonna do,

719
00:38:57,096 --> 00:38:58,263
I'm gonna tail the Morgans,

720
00:38:58,297 --> 00:38:59,731
see if they'll
lead me to her.

721
00:38:59,765 --> 00:39:02,000
Done and done.

722
00:39:02,034 --> 00:39:06,204
How are Astor and Cody
doing with the move?

723
00:39:06,238 --> 00:39:08,306
They're better
now that I told them

724
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,408
they could come down
for Christmas

725
00:39:10,442 --> 00:39:13,745
and that Astor
could have my SUV.

726
00:39:13,779 --> 00:39:15,647
You think you could
drive it up to her?

727
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:17,749
She asked about you.

728
00:39:17,783 --> 00:39:21,185
Yeah, as soon
as the storm passes.

729
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,655
They're saying it might
turn into a hurricane.

730
00:39:23,689 --> 00:39:28,526
It's one of the few things
I won't miss about Florida.

731
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,163
God, this is
such a mindfuck.

732
00:39:32,197 --> 00:39:33,898
After tomorrow,
you're not gonna be here.

733
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:37,702
What the fuck
does that look like?

734
00:39:37,736 --> 00:39:41,072
We both start over.

735
00:39:41,106 --> 00:39:43,775
Is that even possible?

736
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:47,679
Yeah, I think so.

737
00:39:47,713 --> 00:39:50,548
Don't you?

738
00:39:50,582 --> 00:39:54,485
It's just
every fucked up--

739
00:39:59,258 --> 00:40:01,092
every time I've been
a complete mess,

740
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:04,595
you've been there for me.

741
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,098
Even when it was your fault
that I was fucked up,

742
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:08,566
you've never
given up on me.

743
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,603
So if I can't
make this work...

744
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,174
Going back to being
a cop again,

745
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:17,809
then who the fuck
is gonna help me

746
00:40:17,843 --> 00:40:19,110
pick up the pieces of that?

747
00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:22,380
You're not
that person anymore.

748
00:40:22,414 --> 00:40:24,382
You're stronger than that.

749
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:27,018
You're stronger
than I'll ever be.

750
00:40:27,052 --> 00:40:30,355
I'm not.

751
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:32,924
Deb, Dad and Vogel
gave me the code,

752
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:34,225
so I'd know
the right thing to do,

753
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:37,628
but you've always...

754
00:40:37,663 --> 00:40:40,898
Just known.

755
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:43,968
It's the compass
I always wished I had.

756
00:40:44,003 --> 00:40:47,805
And as long
as you listen to that,

757
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,675
you won't need me.

758
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:52,944
You'll be fine.

759
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,981
Maybe.

760
00:40:59,685 --> 00:41:02,620
But don't ever think
that it was the code

761
00:41:02,654 --> 00:41:05,089
that made you
a good brother.

762
00:41:05,124 --> 00:41:08,426
There's a human being
in there.

763
00:41:10,462 --> 00:41:12,697
There always has been.

764
00:41:16,201 --> 00:41:19,170
Even if you can't see it.

765
00:41:20,406 --> 00:41:21,967
Miami Metro is seeking
the public's help

766
00:41:21,974 --> 00:41:24,742
in locating a local man,
Oliver Saxon,

767
00:41:24,777 --> 00:41:27,145
in connection with a string
of grisly recordings

768
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:29,781
that were recently obtained
by channel eight news.

769
00:41:29,815 --> 00:41:30,948
Miami--

770
00:41:33,986 --> 00:41:39,057
Did you help them
recently obtain that footage?

771
00:41:39,091 --> 00:41:41,325
I needed him
to be a wanted man

772
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,528
and force his hand.

773
00:41:43,562 --> 00:41:45,563
If he wants to take
a last stab at me,

774
00:41:45,597 --> 00:41:49,267
now he has
to do it tonight.

775
00:41:49,301 --> 00:41:53,037
Which I why I need you
to get out of here, Deb.

776
00:41:53,072 --> 00:41:54,772
Please.

777
00:41:58,377 --> 00:41:59,811
Bringing him in
for questioning

778
00:41:59,845 --> 00:42:03,548
is still
the department's top priority.

779
00:42:03,582 --> 00:42:05,349
Miami Metro is seeking
the public's help

780
00:42:05,384 --> 00:42:08,653
in locating a suspect,
Oliver Saxon,

781
00:42:08,687 --> 00:42:10,721
in connection with a string
of gruesome videos.

782
00:42:10,756 --> 00:42:13,491
The footage we received
from this anonymous source

783
00:42:13,525 --> 00:42:16,027
details the extreme nature
of the murders,

784
00:42:16,061 --> 00:42:17,161
allegedly committed by--

785
00:42:17,196 --> 00:42:20,164
Fucking Dexter.

786
00:43:13,752 --> 00:43:15,520
Freeze, motherfucker.

787
00:43:22,327 --> 00:43:25,530
I'll take it from here.

788
00:43:25,564 --> 00:43:27,532
Thanks, Deb.

789
00:43:41,847 --> 00:43:45,016
Welcome home.

790
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:48,853
I guess this means you've
decided against the truce.

791
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:51,222
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

792
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:53,591
It's your own fault.

793
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:56,961
You should've walked away,
left Miami when you could.

794
00:43:56,995 --> 00:43:59,564
Mm, I like this place.

795
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:01,899
Miami's a great city.

796
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:03,901
I love the Cuban food.

797
00:44:03,936 --> 00:44:05,303
Nice weather.

798
00:44:05,337 --> 00:44:07,872
Murder solve rate
at about 20%.

799
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:11,876
Yeah.

800
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,178
I understand.

801
00:44:16,181 --> 00:44:18,282
There was a time I wasn't
willing to leave either.

802
00:44:18,317 --> 00:44:23,020
I didn't want
to give up anything.

803
00:44:23,055 --> 00:44:26,857
Sounds like
something's changed.

804
00:44:26,892 --> 00:44:28,826
It has.

805
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,662
Your girlfriend?

806
00:44:31,697 --> 00:44:32,863
Yeah, that's part of it.

807
00:44:32,898 --> 00:44:34,632
Ah.

808
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:36,968
I've never been good
at relationships.

809
00:44:37,002 --> 00:44:39,036
Longest was
a couple of weeks,

810
00:44:39,071 --> 00:44:40,705
and she was chained
to my radiator,

811
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:42,206
so I guess
that doesn't much count.

812
00:44:42,241 --> 00:44:44,642
Not really, no.

813
00:44:44,676 --> 00:44:47,712
Too much anger
towards women, I suppose.

814
00:44:47,746 --> 00:44:50,548
I can thank my mother
for that.

815
00:44:50,582 --> 00:44:53,551
No, that's all on you.

816
00:45:00,726 --> 00:45:02,727
Well, I wish you luck.

817
00:45:02,761 --> 00:45:06,264
Hope you don't stab her
in the heart while she sleeps.

818
00:45:06,298 --> 00:45:10,134
No, Oliver,
I like her.

819
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:15,806
I love her.

820
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:18,709
I think about her
all the time.

821
00:45:18,744 --> 00:45:22,713
I'm thinking
about her right now.

822
00:45:22,748 --> 00:45:26,917
How I'd rather be with her
than here with you.

823
00:45:29,254 --> 00:45:31,289
What?

824
00:45:35,193 --> 00:45:37,428
This is usually
my favorite moment,

825
00:45:37,462 --> 00:45:40,331
the kill.

826
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:42,767
The moment before the kill,
the kill itself,

827
00:45:42,801 --> 00:45:45,469
the moment right after.

828
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:52,510
But now I don't even
want to be here.

829
00:45:54,846 --> 00:45:57,848
I'm feeling
a much stronger pull.

830
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:07,058
I don't need to kill you.

831
00:46:09,695 --> 00:46:12,330
Then don't.

832
00:46:12,364 --> 00:46:14,332
Walk away.

833
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:18,536
I will.

834
00:46:20,706 --> 00:46:22,707
I guess I'll live
to see another day.

835
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:25,910
Oh, no,
you're still gonna die.

836
00:46:25,944 --> 00:46:28,746
Just gonna be
in the electric chair.

837
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,825
Hey, Deb,
change of plans.

838
00:47:12,491 --> 00:47:13,557
Dex.

839
00:47:13,592 --> 00:47:15,826
Saxon's in here.

840
00:47:15,861 --> 00:47:18,696
Arrest him.
Take him in.

841
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:21,866
Arrest him?
He's still alive?

842
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,201
Say you were looking into
the buildings he was inspecting.

843
00:47:24,236 --> 00:47:25,736
You subdued him.

844
00:47:25,771 --> 00:47:28,339
You'll be the hero
of Miami Metro.

845
00:47:28,373 --> 00:47:31,075
I guess I fucking will.

846
00:47:34,312 --> 00:47:36,046
What about your knives?

847
00:47:36,081 --> 00:47:39,350
I've got a plane to catch.

848
00:47:40,952 --> 00:47:42,620
Do you want me
to send them to you?

849
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,288
Leave them as evidence.

850
00:47:44,322 --> 00:47:46,323
Say you found them
in the cabinet.

851
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:47,958
People will think
they're Saxon's.

852
00:47:47,993 --> 00:47:49,193
Let them.

853
00:47:49,227 --> 00:47:52,029
Give him even more credit
than he deserves.

854
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,431
But once I get settled,

855
00:47:53,465 --> 00:47:55,132
I'm gonna figure out a way
to get in touch with you.

856
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:56,200
Dexter--

857
00:47:56,234 --> 00:47:57,468
My car, I'll leave it
at the airport.

858
00:47:57,502 --> 00:48:01,005
- Dexter.
- And Astor--

859
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:02,339
What?

860
00:48:04,342 --> 00:48:07,344
You could at least
fucking hug me.

861
00:48:13,652 --> 00:48:16,253
This is just for right now.
It's not forever.

862
00:48:16,288 --> 00:48:19,457
I know that, fuckface.

863
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:28,599
Go get on a plane.

864
00:48:28,633 --> 00:48:30,634
I will.

865
00:48:36,074 --> 00:48:38,709
Are you sure
about this, Dexter?

866
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:42,980
I am.

867
00:48:43,014 --> 00:48:46,617
I never thought
this day would come.

868
00:48:50,522 --> 00:48:53,357
You don't need me anymore.

869
00:49:15,313 --> 00:49:17,748
This is Debra Morgan
requesting backup

870
00:49:17,782 --> 00:49:21,619
at the Rendell Psychiatric
Hospital in Allapattah.

871
00:49:33,064 --> 00:49:37,902
What the fuck
is going on here?

872
00:49:37,936 --> 00:49:39,603
Help me, please!

873
00:49:39,638 --> 00:49:41,672
I was abducted by the man
who was just here.

874
00:49:41,706 --> 00:49:42,673
Did you see him?

875
00:49:42,707 --> 00:49:44,008
I didn't see anybody.

876
00:49:44,042 --> 00:49:46,644
Get me out of here, please,
before he comes back.

877
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:52,149
I thought I was gonna die.

878
00:49:52,183 --> 00:49:55,786
Thank God you came here.

879
00:49:58,557 --> 00:50:00,724
Don't move.

880
00:50:05,063 --> 00:50:07,331
Aah!

881
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:24,214
This is detective Debra Morgan.
I've been shot.

882
00:50:24,249 --> 00:50:27,284
Please send help.

883
00:50:34,759 --> 00:50:38,963
I used to live my life
at night.

884
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:42,333
In the shadow
of my dark passenger.

885
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:46,537
I lived in shadows
for so long,

886
00:50:46,571 --> 00:50:50,708
until the dark
became my world.

887
00:50:50,742 --> 00:50:52,910
But over time,
the people in my life

888
00:50:52,944 --> 00:50:55,746
flipped on a light.

889
00:50:57,482 --> 00:51:00,918
At first I was blinded,
it was so bright.

890
00:51:05,724 --> 00:51:07,992
But over the years,
my eyes adjusted,

891
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:11,762
and I could see.

892
00:51:11,796 --> 00:51:14,732
And now what's in focus
is my future.

893
00:51:14,766 --> 00:51:16,567
Bright.

894
00:51:16,601 --> 00:51:19,570
Brighter than it's ever been.

895
