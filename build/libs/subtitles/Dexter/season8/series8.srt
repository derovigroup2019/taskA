00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:50,194
Remember me?

6
00:01:50,298 --> 00:01:51,538
What are you doing here,
Hannah?

7
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:53,834
Should probably leave
before my husband returns.

8
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:56,075
- Your husband?
- Oh, my God.

9
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,477
You're still in love with her,
aren't you?

10
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:58,611
No.

11
00:01:58,646 --> 00:02:00,947
We have got to get her
out of our lives.

12
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:02,615
So what is it you'd like to do?

13
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,617
I would like to take her
to Marshal Services

14
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:05,678
and have her the fuck arrested.

15
00:02:05,798 --> 00:02:07,620
When the brain surgeon
was out there,

16
00:02:07,655 --> 00:02:10,590
I trusted Dexter to solve
the problem, and he did.

17
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,525
Before you take matters
into your own hands,

18
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:14,556
be sure to consider
all the consequences

19
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,547
of those actions.

20
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:19,365
Can I borrow that
high-tech GPS tracker?

21
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:23,326
Zach Hamilton killed
Norma Rivera.

22
00:02:23,446 --> 00:02:26,906
What if you were to teach
Zach the code?

23
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:31,177
Am I ready to be
a spiritual father?

00:02:31,212 --> 00:02:32,479

Hi, Dexter!

27
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:36,613
Going for a little night swim.

28
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:38,051
Enjoy.

29
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:39,586
What the fuck
were you thinking?

30
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,855
That rich asshole
is walking around free.

31
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:43,049
We have nothing on this kid.

32
00:02:43,057 --> 00:02:44,123
That's why I was following him.

33
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:45,391
Let it go.
That's an order.

34
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:47,927
By the way, me and Jamie
are moving in together.

35
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:48,928
What?

36
00:02:48,963 --> 00:02:50,196
Why did you marry him?

37
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:52,165
Because he was there
when you weren't.

38
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,280
No, Miles, stop it, please.

39
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,635
You'll never leave this boat.

40
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,339
I told the crew

41
00:02:59,373 --> 00:03:01,741
that Miles was going to New York
for a few days.

42
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:04,244
Please don't leave town
before we talk again.

43
00:03:04,278 --> 00:03:06,546
I won't.

44
00:03:10,217 --> 00:03:11,618
Come on, what the fuck?
Dexter!

45
00:03:11,652 --> 00:03:14,354
It looks like he's not home.

00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:18,224
Cassie.

47
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:21,261
Norma Rivera was bludgeoned.

48
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:24,097
Is it possible Zach did this?

49
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:42,476
Every contact leaves a trace.

50
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,143
That idea is the foundation
of all crime scene analysis.

51
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:54,341
I should be focused on
who bludgeoned Cassie and why.

52
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,146
But instead...

53
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,851
ever since Hannah came back
into my orbit,

54
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:06,086
she's all I can think about.

55
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,833
Manner of death?

Swan.

57
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:25,272
Killer didn't plan this.
It was impulsive.

58
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,142
This is just how Zach Hamilton
killed Norma Rivera.

59
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:30,911
She was killed pretty deep
in her apartment.

60
00:04:30,945 --> 00:04:33,280
Like she let
the killer in herself.

61
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,249
So she knew him.

62
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:37,584
That guy she was dating.

63
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:40,654
You said you were coming here
to pick Cassie up for a date.

64
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:42,923
Yes, I was late.

65
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:45,225
Where were you coming from?

66
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,829
I had a...
the building inspection.

67
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:50,130
I'm a structural engineer.

68
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:53,367
Okay, well, maybe I was wrong.

69
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:55,035
Maybe it was the repair man
or the delivery guy.

70
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:56,603
Or Zach Hamilton.

71
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:58,172
If I'd paid
more attention to Zach

72
00:04:58,206 --> 00:04:59,406
instead of being with Hannah...

00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:01,542
[Sobs]

74
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:04,545
Would Cassie still be alive?

75
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:16,089
Is that Zach's blood?

76
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:17,491
Zach knew Cassie.

77
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,294
He met her once, here with me.

78
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:23,630
Cassie was a good person.

79
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:25,966
You're sure there was no one
else she was having issues with?

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,534
Just try and think.

81
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,336
I can't think right now.
Can you just--please--

82
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,705
It's okay, it's okay.

83
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,211
Hey, Deb, how are you?

84
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:38,545
I'm okay.

85
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,347
It's good to see you,
you know, at a crime scene.

86
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,249
I'm gonna talk to Dex.

87
00:05:42,283 --> 00:05:44,451
Go ahead.

88
00:05:48,122 --> 00:05:50,824
Harrison's asleep.

89
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:52,192
Thanks.

90
00:05:55,497 --> 00:05:57,431
That's a break.

91
00:05:57,465 --> 00:05:59,099
Could that be
the killer's blood?

92
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:02,069
Here's hoping.

93
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:06,440
Are you okay?

94
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:08,442
Sure.

95
00:06:08,476 --> 00:06:11,411
Why the fuck do I even ask?

96
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:13,881
What about Hannah?

97
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,449
What about her?

98
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:16,650
Is she still here?

99
00:06:16,684 --> 00:06:17,718
Hey, Deb.

100
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,653
Hey.

101
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:21,588
Who would want to kill Cassie?

102
00:06:21,623 --> 00:06:23,090
She owe people money?

103
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:24,458
We're looking into that.

104
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:27,661
What about customers
or a vendor?

105
00:06:27,695 --> 00:06:28,929
Sorry.

106
00:06:28,963 --> 00:06:31,899
I have no fucking business
being here.

107
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,767
Anytime you wanna come back,
the door's always open.

108
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:37,337
Maybe I'll put an application
in the mail.

109
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:41,074
I'll come back to finish
this conversation, yeah?

110
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,877
Okay.

111
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:45,746
Can't wait.

112
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:54,288
I would give everything
to feel nothing again.

113
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,333
[Both sigh]

114
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:10,804
We need to get you out of town
as soon as possible.

115
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:12,940
I need a new passport.

116
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,214
I have a guy that can do that.

117
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:15,609
I'll find out what he needs.

118
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,278
That's just a phone call.

119
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,480
You could have phoned me,

120
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:23,450
rather than driving
all the way down here.

121
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,620
This was on the way to the lab.

122
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,590
This marina is not
on the way to the lab.

123
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,429
You know, we, um...

124
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:39,366
we missed a spot of blood
cleaning up.

125
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,467
No, we didn't.

126
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,661
Edge of the whiskey bottle.

127
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,937
I noticed it this morning.

128
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:48,475
I was so glad to see it

129
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,311
because it reminded me of you.

130
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:55,916
Did you clean it up?

131
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,718
Yes, I cleaned it up.

132
00:07:57,752 --> 00:07:59,186
With bleach?

133
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,990
Yes.

134
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,593
Miami is not the place
for you to be right now.

135
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:11,365
The sooner we get you
out of here, the better.

136
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,401
I completely agree.

[Beep]

139
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,787
It is Zach's blood
under Cassie's nails.

140
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:36,723
He killed another
innocent woman.

141
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:38,225
What a waste.

142
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:40,060
He could have had
a great future.

143
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:42,362
Miami Metro can never know.

144
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,998
It's one small step
from Zach to me.

145
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:46,333
Hey, Dex.

146
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:48,068
Hey, remember Niki,

147
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:49,636

too far from my tree?

148
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:51,171
- Hi.
- Hi.

149
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:54,875
Around here we call Dexter
"The King of Spatter."

150
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,976
We do?

151
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,246
I do, in private.

152
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,582
Hey, feel free to send
any and all paperwork her way.

153
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:05,619
Here you go.

154
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:08,689
Oh, uh, the blood
under Cassie's nails?

155
00:09:08,723 --> 00:09:10,657
No luck.
It was hers.

156
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:14,227
From a transfer
after her head started to bleed.

157
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,764
"The victim collapsed
into a pool of her own blood."

158
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:20,367
Hey, are you--
are you okay with all this?

159
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:23,003
I mean,
I am a little bit worried

160
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:25,072
about the energy around here.

161
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,474
Well, then maybe we can hang
a crystal in the corner.

162
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:30,477
Yeah, we should sage
the place first.

163
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,648
Hey, could I talk to you
for a sec?

164
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:36,717
- Actually, I'm--
- Real quick.

165
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:39,686
You recognize these?

166
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:40,987
Yeah, I took them.

167
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:42,422
Yeah, now look at these.

168
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,791
Norma Rivera,
Cassie Jollenston.

169
00:09:44,826 --> 00:09:47,794
Are they fucking similar,
or what?

170
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:49,296
They were both bludgeoned.

171
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,299
Bludgeonings can look
pretty fucking similar.

172
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,736
Do you think Zach Hamilton
could have done this?

173
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,404
Zach knew Norma.

174
00:09:57,438 --> 00:09:59,172
How could he have possibly
known Cassie?

175
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:00,474
I know,
it's crazy, I--

176
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:03,110
Yeah, what's crazy
is Batista and Matthews

177
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,878
wanted you to lay off
looking into this Hamilton kid.

178
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:06,046
What are you doing?

179
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,381
This Hamilton kid
is a fucking monster.

180
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,449
You know it too.

181
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,784
Not really.

182
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,720
I think you should drop this.
Think about your career.

183
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:15,088
Why? It's not like
I'm gonna make sergeant.

184
00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:16,389
Just do me a favor.

185
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:18,191
You see any of Zach's DNA
at the crime scene,

186
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:19,926
just let me know.

187
00:10:19,961 --> 00:10:22,729
Absolutely.

188
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:26,133
He hasn't returned my calls.

189
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,902
I tried to reach him too.

190
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:32,172
I spoke to his parents,
they haven't seen him.

191
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:35,242
He could be on the run,
hiding out somewhere.

192
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:38,712
Were you with at Hannah person?

193
00:10:38,746 --> 00:10:41,348
Is that why this woman is dead?

194
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:44,351
She's dead because you
talked me out of killing Zach

195
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:46,186
in the first place.

196
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:52,025
He showed real potential.
You saw that.

197
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:55,428
I thought you were having
an impact on him.

198
00:10:55,463 --> 00:10:58,498
Zach spoke to me of trying
to live up to your rules,

199
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,167
your standards.

200
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,135
[Sighs]

201
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,138
I thought he was
processing it all.

202
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:07,574
Yeah, Zach's smart,
but he can't control himself.

203
00:11:07,608 --> 00:11:09,209
We both should have seen that.

204
00:11:09,243 --> 00:11:13,046
Zach's just a boy.

205
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,882
A boy who knows
too much about me,

206
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:19,886
about you, who's killed
two innocent women.

207
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:25,492
No, I guess you don't have
many options, do you?

208
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:29,129
No.

209
00:11:29,163 --> 00:11:32,699
I wonder if it will be
different for you,

210
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,502
because of what
could have been.

211
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:36,603
I doubt it.

212
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:40,340
But surely there have been...

213
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:42,876
people that were
more difficult for you to--

214
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,980
how do you like to say it?
...take care of.

215
00:11:47,014 --> 00:11:52,252
Zach Hamilton
is not one of them.

216
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:55,622
I'm not sure I believe you.

217
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:06,399
Zach rented a room
in Fiesta Key.

218
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,436
He's on the run,
and using his own credit card.

219
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,838
Rookie mistake.

220
00:12:16,844 --> 00:12:21,381
I forget the impact murder has
on real people.

221
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:24,351
[Knocking at the door]

222
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,090
Deb.

223
00:12:32,026 --> 00:12:33,693
Any luck?

224
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:36,263
With what?

225
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,732
Cassie's case?

226
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:41,868
- Is that why you're here?
- No.

227
00:12:41,903 --> 00:12:45,138
Hey, Jaime.
How are you doing?

228
00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:48,275
I don't know how you two
do this every day.

229
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,976
I don't.
[Chuckles]

230
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:52,479
Right.

231
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:03,857
On a scale of one to ten,

232
00:13:03,891 --> 00:13:07,327
ten being
out of our lives forever,

233
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:08,695
where the fuck is Hannah McKay?

234
00:13:08,729 --> 00:13:09,863
She's not a threat, Deb.

235
00:13:09,897 --> 00:13:11,458
The last time we talked
on this subject,

236
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:13,033
- you said, "I'm on top of it."
- And I am.

237
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:15,568
Are you on top of it,
or are you on top of her?

238
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:17,837
- Deb--
- Is she in Miami?

239
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:20,573
[Sighs]

240
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:21,708
What the fuck
is she doing here?

241
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:23,910
It has to do with her husband.

242
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:25,278
The casino guy?

243
00:13:25,313 --> 00:13:27,981
Yeah, he's abusive,
verbally and physically.

244
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,483
They seem perfect.

245
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,721
- What about him?
- She wanted me to--

246
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:37,257
Why didn't she do it herself?

247
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,694
Too much scrutiny.

248
00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:43,463
Did you do it?

249
00:13:43,497 --> 00:13:45,865
No.

250
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,335
Well, that must have
pissed her off.

251
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,870
What's to keep her
from trying to kill us again?

252
00:13:50,905 --> 00:13:53,907
She didn't try to kill us.
She wanted to get my attention.

253
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:55,275
By poisoning me and leaving you

254
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:57,544
on the side
of the fucking road?

255
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:02,582
You have the fucking altitude
to see all of this,

256
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:06,920
that she's using you, and you
still want to protect her?

257
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:09,322
[Sighs]
When she gets her passport,

258
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:13,660
she'll be out of our lives
forever.

259
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:15,528
- You believe that?
- I do.

260
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,130
Okay, well, that's the thing
that you can't see,

261
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:20,066
that you're lying to yourself.

262
00:14:20,101 --> 00:14:24,237
She's a murderer.
She needs to be locked up.

263
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:26,006
She could talk.
After LaGuerta,

264
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,208
I can't afford another round
of questions from anyone.

265
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,378
She's a fugitive.
She's a poisoner.

266
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:35,115
She's easily discredited.

267
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:38,818
Enough already.

268
00:14:38,853 --> 00:14:40,420
[Door closing]

269
00:14:40,454 --> 00:14:42,455
[Sighs]

270
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,966
We were supposed
to have lunch together,

271
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,435
Cassie and me.

272
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:57,704
Jaime, I'm sorry.

273
00:14:57,738 --> 00:15:00,807
I can't be here right now.

274
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:03,543
I can take Harrison with me.

275
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:06,413
I moved in with Joey.

276
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,514
Oh.

277
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:09,616
I thought we'd go there,

278
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,885
since you're on
the next few days.

279
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,087
I mean,
if that's okay with you.

280
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:17,123
Yeah, that's okay with me.

281
00:15:24,432 --> 00:15:27,000
Don't smile?

282
00:15:31,238 --> 00:15:35,475
Just send this
to the passport guy.

283
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:39,846
He'll have a new identity
and all the paperwork for you

284
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,347
by tomorrow.

285
00:15:41,382 --> 00:15:44,184
Do I get to pick my name?

286
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:46,920
I doubt it, but I'll ask.

287
00:15:46,954 --> 00:15:49,656
So does he drop it off,
or--

288
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,624
No, I will.

289
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,529
Okay, so just wait here?

290
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:59,365
- Maybe you should come with me.
- Where?

291
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,101
I have to go to the Keys
tonight.

292
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:03,269
The Keys?

293
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:05,738
It would just be for the night.

294
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,644
Besides, it's not safe
for you to be here.

295
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,948
- Safe?
- You know, alone.

296
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:17,617
I only sent the crew away
for a few hours

297
00:16:17,651 --> 00:16:19,586
because I knew
that you were coming.

298
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,655
They can protect me
from almost anything.

299
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:27,861
It's the "almost"
that concerns me.

300
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:30,196
So what's in the Keys,

301
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:32,232
or should I say
who is in the Keys?

302
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:35,001
I'll tell you on the way down.

303
00:16:36,837 --> 00:16:40,507
How would you like to make
a boatload of cash?

304
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,509
I'm assuming that's
a rhetorical question.

305
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,712
U.S. Marshal Service
is offering $25,000

306
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:47,947
for information leading
to the arrest of Hannah McKay.

307
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:50,650
Sal price's publisher
is offering another 125,000,

308
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:53,386
his family another 100,000.
Put that together, and you get--

309
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,355
250,000.
Yeah, I can do math.

310
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,291
I think Hannah McKay
is back in Miami.

311
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:00,226
And you think this because?

312
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:03,396
Are you interested or not?

313
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,299
Very.

314
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:13,740
No fucking way.
They're gone.

315
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:15,508
You sure this is
the Castner slip?

316
00:17:15,543 --> 00:17:16,910
I'm sure.

317
00:17:16,944 --> 00:17:18,678
You sure Hannah McKay
was going under the alias

318
00:17:18,712 --> 00:17:22,081
- of Maggie Castner?
- Yes.

319
00:17:22,116 --> 00:17:24,951
What, you don't believe me?

320
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:27,220
Lot of pretty, blonde girls
in Miami.

321
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,721
You sure Hannah McKay was here?

322
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,757
I know for a fucking fact
that she was.

323
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,892
How?

324
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,562
I just do.

325
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,464
You really don't like her,
do you?

326
00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:40,533
Nope.

327
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:43,203
I'm just saying, emotions
cloud your judgment, you know?

328
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:44,737
You keep it about the money,

329
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,272
someday, you may have
one of these yachts.

330
00:17:46,307 --> 00:17:48,007
I don't want a fucking yacht.

331
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:52,779
Well, I do, so let's keep it
about my money, all right?

332
00:17:52,813 --> 00:17:54,414
Okay, so the yacht may be gone,

333
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,051
but we don't know
if they were fucking on it.

334
00:17:58,085 --> 00:17:59,886
Maybe the dock master
knows something.

335
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,154
I'll see
if he's bribe-able.

336
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:04,157
I'll meet you
back at the office, all right?

337
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:11,331
Joey, I don't want
to be here alone.

338
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:13,066
You're not alone,
you got the kid.

339
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,202
My name is Harrison.

340
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:17,837
And a fine name that is.

341
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:21,140
Don't you got
some cartoons to watch?

342
00:18:21,175 --> 00:18:25,778
Joey, I am freaking out.
My friend was murdered.

343
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:30,450
I--look, I know,
but once I catch the killer,

344
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,786
you're not gonna have to be
scared anymore, okay?

345
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,456
You know, if it were Deb
asking you to stay,

346
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,891
you wouldn't even
put up a fight.

347
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:41,294
Deb wouldn't ask me to stay.

348
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,463
She'd want to catch the killer
as bad as I do.

349
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,499
Sorry I'm not Deb.

350
00:18:48,602 --> 00:18:50,503
Hey, hey, hey, come here.

351
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:55,241
You need me to stay here,
I'll stay here, okay?

352
00:19:08,222 --> 00:19:11,991
- Fuck-bucket.
- Moth

353
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,128
[phone ringing]

354
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:16,396
Hey, Deb, what's up?

355
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,932
Hey, just checking in...
about Hannah.

356
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:22,201

00:30:14,955 --> 00:30:17,056
and then bragged about it.
Is she cool?

533
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,459
Yes, she's cool.

534
00:30:20,493 --> 00:30:22,061
Where were you two days ago?

535
00:30:22,095 --> 00:30:24,163
I stopped by your place
right after you blew me off,

536
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,764
and then I came straight here.
I--

537
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,666
I met your neighbor,
the hot one.

538
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,569
That was Cassie.

539
00:30:30,603 --> 00:30:33,339
She--she was alive
when I left.

540
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,207
I've been on Shawn
the whole time.

541
00:30:35,241 --> 00:30:38,243
I'll show you on my camera.

542
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:43,248
How did you--
how did you find me?

543
00:30:43,283 --> 00:30:45,184
I tracked your credit card.

544
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,186
Right.

545
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,688
Shouldn't use my own card,
total fuck-up on my part.

546
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,156
What'd you think of the room?

547
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:52,891
Wait, did you
do something to it?

548
00:30:52,926 --> 00:30:55,761
- Just show me the pictures.
- Sorry.

549
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:59,264
This is Shawn Decker.

550
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:02,267
He lives here.

551
00:31:02,302 --> 00:31:05,938
You can see by the time stamp,
I've been hunting him.

552
00:31:05,972 --> 00:31:11,510
So I decided
to go after a killer.

553
00:31:11,544 --> 00:31:14,213
Someone who deserves it.

554
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:18,317
He was following the code
without even knowing it.

555
00:31:18,351 --> 00:31:20,919
Do you have proof
that Shawn killed someone?

556
00:31:20,954 --> 00:31:23,288
Yeah, he pulled me aside
at a party,

557
00:31:23,323 --> 00:31:26,291
showed me this video of this
redhead he met in Daytona.

558
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:31,430
He "accidentally" strangled her
while they were having sex.

559
00:31:31,464 --> 00:31:36,168
Believe me, the world's
better off without him.

560
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,272
Where is Shawn now?

561
00:31:46,312 --> 00:31:47,679
[Scoffs]

562
00:31:47,714 --> 00:31:50,916
It--it didn't go
exactly as I planned.

563
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,419
I thought I could just
knock him out.

564
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,721
You sedated me, didn't you?
What did you use?

565
00:31:55,755 --> 00:31:57,222
Tell me what happened
with Shawn.

566
00:31:57,257 --> 00:31:59,425
I hit him over the head,
but it wasn't hard enough.

567
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:03,529
He barely went down,
so I just kept hitting him,

568
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:05,464
like, a lot.

569
00:32:05,498 --> 00:32:06,832
Did anyone see you?

570
00:32:06,866 --> 00:32:08,534
No, we were alone.

571
00:32:08,568 --> 00:32:10,836
What were you planning
on doing with the body?

572
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,540
I didn't totally know.
I...was gonna come back here,

573
00:32:14,574 --> 00:32:17,342
get my camera, my knives, and--
I don't know.

574
00:32:17,377 --> 00:32:18,877
Guess I just thought,
drop him off in the Everglades

575
00:32:18,912 --> 00:32:20,412
- on the way back.
- So you didn't have a plan?

576
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:22,347
I did have a plan.
I was gonna do it here.

577
00:32:22,382 --> 00:32:24,383
I mean,
this place isn't bad, is it?

578
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:26,585
You see that second floor?

579
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:29,321
Anyone could see you
moving the body.

580
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:32,191
- That wasn't on the website.
- Then pick a different place.

581
00:32:32,225 --> 00:32:33,992
I'd already paid for the room.

582
00:32:34,027 --> 00:32:38,030
You need to have a plan
and a backup plan, always.

583
00:32:38,064 --> 00:32:41,066
Driving around with a dead body
in your trunk in this heat

584
00:32:41,101 --> 00:32:42,234
is no plan at all.

585
00:32:42,268 --> 00:32:44,036
You didn't even
put plastic in your car.

586
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,805
Oh, okay, that would've been
a good idea, yeah.

587
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,273
[Sighs]

588
00:32:48,308 --> 00:32:50,175
All right, you and I
are gonna deal with this body

589
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,111
and then scrub the car
clean of DNA,

590
00:32:52,145 --> 00:32:55,581
because one drop of blood,
a single hair could lead

591
00:32:55,615 --> 00:32:57,916
straight back to you.

592
00:32:57,951 --> 00:33:00,686
Then after that,
we're gonna dump the car.

593
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,621
Well, how am I gonna get home?

594
00:33:02,655 --> 00:33:05,090
We'll take you.

595
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:07,092
Awesome.

596
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:08,594
Can you deal with the room?

597
00:33:08,628 --> 00:33:10,108
We shouldn't be
more than a few hours.

598
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,098
Yeah, drive safe.

599
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,369
Dude.

600
00:33:17,403 --> 00:33:21,073
Do not "dude" me.
Get in the car.

601
00:33:21,107 --> 00:33:22,908
Watch yourself
on the door handle.

602
00:33:22,942 --> 00:33:25,944
I cut myself on that
piece of shit a few days ago.

603
00:33:28,314 --> 00:33:30,616
Have you cut yourself
on this handle before?

604
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,218
No.

605
00:33:33,253 --> 00:33:36,054
Is that somehow
how Zach's blood

606
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:39,191
ended up under Cassie's nails?

607
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:42,694
I bled all over the place.

608
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,730
Look.

609
00:33:46,866 --> 00:33:49,568
Fuck me, gloves!

610
00:33:49,602 --> 00:33:51,069
Just put your seat belt on.

611
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,105
[Engine starting]

612
00:34:09,189 --> 00:34:11,590
Hannah fucking McKay.

613
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:14,092
Don't even think about it.
Where's Dexter?

614
00:34:14,127 --> 00:34:15,827
- Out.
- Great, that'll make this

615
00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:17,062
- a lot easier.
- [Scoffs]

616
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,264
I'm supposed to just
put those on?

617
00:34:19,299 --> 00:34:20,699
- You're under arrest.
- I don't believe

618
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:22,000
that you're a police officer
anymore.

619
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:24,303
- Citizen's arrest.
- Oh, right, really?

620
00:34:24,337 --> 00:34:25,370
Well, how about I arrest you

621
00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:27,105
for aiding and abetting
a serial killer?

622
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,807
You really want that information
getting out?

623
00:34:28,841 --> 00:34:30,309
Talk all you fucking like.

624
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:31,610
You don't have evidence
of anything,

625
00:34:31,644 --> 00:34:32,945
plus, no one would
fucking believe you.

626
00:34:32,979 --> 00:34:35,180
Trust me, better people
than you have tried it.

627
00:34:35,215 --> 00:34:36,481
- Go ahead.
- No!

628
00:34:36,516 --> 00:34:38,116
The only way I'm leaving
is if you shoot me,

629
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:40,686
and we both know
you're not gonna do that.

630
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,621
[Sighs]

631
00:34:42,655 --> 00:34:45,624
You know, I have done
some terrible things in my past,

632
00:34:45,658 --> 00:34:47,392
but I have come to realize
that as people,

633
00:34:47,427 --> 00:34:50,128
we're all horribly flawed,
some more than others.

634
00:34:50,163 --> 00:34:51,196
I'm not interested.

635
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:53,665
But we all have
a will to survive,

636
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,670
and when in extreme situations,
people do extreme things.

637
00:34:58,705 --> 00:35:00,639
That doesn't make it right.

638
00:35:00,673 --> 00:35:01,974
Sometimes, right or wrong

639
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:03,175
doesn't even make it
into the equation.

640
00:35:03,209 --> 00:35:05,310
Sometimes, there are
other forces driving us.

641
00:35:05,345 --> 00:35:07,079
What's driving you?

642
00:35:07,113 --> 00:35:09,681
Dexter.

643
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,858
The passing of the torch.

644
00:35:19,892 --> 00:35:22,828
I taught you the code.

645
00:35:22,862 --> 00:35:24,730
Now, he's learning it from you.

646
00:35:24,764 --> 00:35:27,799
And look at him.

647
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,603
You used to feel like that
after a kill.

648
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:32,938
At peace.

649
00:35:32,972 --> 00:35:35,774
Life was so simple then.

650
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:39,978
Killing consumed you,
crept into everything you did.

651
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:43,081
It was all you had.

652
00:35:43,116 --> 00:35:45,417
But now?

653
00:35:45,451 --> 00:35:47,486
Now, I have Harrison.

654
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,656
He isn't a complication.

655
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,225
Hannah is.

656
00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:57,929
She's more of a...
distraction.

657
00:35:57,964 --> 00:36:02,334
Or is it possible there's
a stronger desire in you now?

658
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,337
Stronger than the need to kill?

659
00:36:13,146 --> 00:36:15,480
I don't enjoy killing.

660
00:36:15,515 --> 00:36:17,049
Why do you do it?

661
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,843
Because sometimes,
it's the only way I know

662
00:36:18,851 --> 00:36:20,719
how to solve a problem.
When somebody comes at me

663
00:36:20,753 --> 00:36:22,621
or threatens me, my life--

664
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:23,722
Like me?

665
00:36:23,756 --> 00:36:25,390
I could've killed you
the other day,

666
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:26,858
and it would've made my life
a hell of a lot easier,

667
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,794
- but I didn't.
- Why?

668
00:36:28,828 --> 00:36:31,997
Because I love your brother,
and I--and I've learned

669
00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:34,833
how much he cares about you,
and I didn't want to hurt him.

670
00:36:38,871 --> 00:36:42,741
He loves me too.
Do you really want to hurt him?

671
00:36:42,775 --> 00:36:44,743
Fuck.

672
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:51,850
My brother screws up
everything.

673
00:37:02,795 --> 00:37:04,529
Oh, you're both
still breathing.

674
00:37:04,564 --> 00:37:06,498
That's a good sign.

675
00:37:06,532 --> 00:37:07,999
What are you doing here?

676
00:37:08,034 --> 00:37:09,434
I came here for her.

677
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:10,702
- But how did you--
- GPS.

678
00:37:10,737 --> 00:37:12,371
I put it
under your fucking car.

679
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:13,805
- You what?
- I knew you wouldn't

680
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,674
stay away from her.

681
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:17,042
Who the fuck are you?

682
00:37:17,076 --> 00:37:20,679
Who the fuck are <i>you?</i>

683
00:37:20,713 --> 00:37:22,814
F--

684
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:24,049
Fuck it, I don't want to know.

685
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:25,851
I don't want to know
anything else ever.

686
00:37:25,885 --> 00:37:28,520
She's your problem now.

687
00:37:28,554 --> 00:37:30,555
[Door opening]

688
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,758
Dude.

689
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,761
I'm sorry, you got girls
fighting over you?

690
00:37:39,365 --> 00:37:41,733
Let's get out of here.

691
00:37:52,011 --> 00:37:55,013
Are we there yet?

692
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,421
Zach.

693
00:38:02,455 --> 00:38:04,623
Hey.

694
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,625
Zach, it turns out,

695
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,128
is a fast learner.

696
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,831
Well, I'm very relieved
to hear that.

697
00:38:12,865 --> 00:38:14,733
Why don't you come in,
have some dinner?

698
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:17,769
- I'm starving.
- I can't.

699
00:38:19,439 --> 00:38:22,841
Who is that in the car?

700
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,843
That's Hannah.

701
00:38:24,877 --> 00:38:27,913
Hannah McKay?

702
00:38:27,947 --> 00:38:29,481
And you weren't
going to introduce us?

703
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,716
Well, we've had
a really long drive,

704
00:38:31,751 --> 00:38:33,785
and she's leaving
early tomorrow.

705
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,521
- I think we're tired.
- Surely, you must be hungry.

706
00:38:36,556 --> 00:38:38,190
She can join us for dinner.

707
00:38:38,224 --> 00:38:39,958
- No, that's not--
- I insist.

708
00:38:39,992 --> 00:38:43,128
Either you invite her in
or I will.

Dr. Vogel, uh...this is Hannah.

710
00:39:14,594 --> 00:39:17,729
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

711
00:39:17,763 --> 00:39:19,531
Call me Evelyn.

712
00:39:23,536 --> 00:39:26,471
I trust there are
no vegetarians here.

713
00:39:26,506 --> 00:39:29,508
Hand me your plate.

714
00:39:30,776 --> 00:39:32,344
It looks delicious.

715
00:39:32,378 --> 00:39:36,047
An old family recipe.
Hope it holds out.

716
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,583
I can pass it along to you
if you'd like.

717
00:39:38,618 --> 00:39:41,319
I'm guessing you know your way
around the kitchen.

718
00:39:41,354 --> 00:39:42,654
I'm an okay cook.

719
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:45,290
You're better than okay.

720
00:39:45,324 --> 00:39:47,192
Well, I prefer gardening.

721
00:39:47,226 --> 00:39:52,063
Bringing things to life.
Perfect.

722
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,099
The best hobbies
are the ones that take us

723
00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:56,801
furthest from our primary
occupation.

724
00:39:58,971 --> 00:40:01,540
So you have
a fascinating field.

725
00:40:01,574 --> 00:40:05,544
How did you
get interested in it?

726
00:40:05,578 --> 00:40:10,181
Oh, an incident long
ago that I won't bore you with.

727
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:15,554
As to what keeps me
interested, well...

728
00:40:15,588 --> 00:40:18,156
look around the table.

729
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:22,093
Elbows.

730
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:25,096
I've always maintained that
the greatest obstacle in life

731
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:28,433
isn't danger, it's boredom.

732
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:31,069
- Boredom?
- Mm, the battle against it

733
00:40:31,103 --> 00:40:33,572
is responsible for most
of the events in the world,

734
00:40:33,606 --> 00:40:35,073
good or ill.

735
00:40:35,107 --> 00:40:36,474
I'm convinced of it.

736
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:40,245
Anyway, my patients
never fail to surprise.

737
00:40:40,279 --> 00:40:44,082
They make life interesting,
thus, worth living.

738
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,055
For example,
I would never have imagined

739
00:40:50,089 --> 00:40:54,559
that the affection you two share
could be possible...

740
00:40:54,594 --> 00:40:57,228
for people like yourselves.

741
00:40:57,263 --> 00:41:01,166
You are obviously
quite taken with each other.

742
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,237
You both have
a healthy blush response.

743
00:41:06,272 --> 00:41:07,672
I'm embarrassing you.

744
00:41:07,707 --> 00:41:09,841
Gee, you think?

745
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:13,845
The truth is,
you make a good couple.

746
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:15,814
And probably a bad one too.

747
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,317
Bon appetit.

Yeah, there is.

No, it's perfect.

752
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:33,932
Dexter, you haven't said much.

753
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:36,668
Something on your mind?

754
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:40,872
It's Cassie's murder.

755
00:41:40,906 --> 00:41:43,742
I doubt there's anything
this table can't handle.

756
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:51,349
The scene,
it doesn't make sense.

757
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:54,953
Did you take any pictures?

758
00:41:57,356 --> 00:42:02,293
Whoa.
It's just like Norma Rivera.

759
00:42:02,328 --> 00:42:05,463
Look at the blood.

760
00:42:05,498 --> 00:42:07,699
When someone's
bludgeoned to death,

761
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,968
blood is no longer just blood.

762
00:42:10,002 --> 00:42:14,305
It's cast-off blood,
atomized blood, pooled blood.

763
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:18,476
Different first names
but same family...

764
00:42:18,511 --> 00:42:23,081
with one story to tell.

765
00:42:23,115 --> 00:42:25,984
I found your blood
underneath Cassie's fingernails.

766
00:42:26,018 --> 00:42:29,020
But Zach had nothing to do
with Cassie's murder.

767
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:30,622
So how'd my blood end up there?

768
00:42:30,656 --> 00:42:33,892
I'm wondering if it came
from your car door handle.

769
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:36,094
You think someone could have
done that to your car

770
00:42:36,128 --> 00:42:37,429
on purpose?

771
00:42:37,463 --> 00:42:39,931
To set you up for her murder?

772
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:42,534
Well, if so, they went to
a lot of trouble to frame you.

773
00:42:42,568 --> 00:42:44,335
And why would someone do that?

774
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:47,372
- [Sighs]
- Money?

775
00:42:47,406 --> 00:42:51,676
[Chuckles] You see?
Never a dull moment.

Hey, buddy, what's that?

779
00:43:03,656 --> 00:43:06,458
- A zombie.
- Nice.

780
00:43:06,492 --> 00:43:08,493
I hope you don't mind
that we're here.

781
00:43:08,527 --> 00:43:10,428
Not at all.

782
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,564

783
00:43:12,598 --> 00:43:14,632
No, we're fine,

You're still shaken up
about Cassie.

785

Is it okay if we stay
with you tonight?

786

You two can stay here
as long as you want.

Does it look like
she's handcuffed to my desk?

792
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:53,238
It does not.

793
00:43:53,272 --> 00:43:58,476
You couldn't find her,
so we will--we'll keep looking.

Aw, fuck that,
Hannah's probably

795
00:43:59,779 --> 00:44:01,780

796
00:44:01,814 --> 00:44:03,114

and let it go.

are you doing here then?

803
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:22,700
I don't know.
I've been asking myself

804
00:44:22,735 --> 00:44:24,369
the same question, actually.

805
00:44:24,403 --> 00:44:28,106
Okay, is there something
you want to say to me?

806
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,975
I'm not sure I'm cut out
to be a private investigator.

that we do,

that I want it on my tombstone.

throwing away this opportunity.

00:49:47,426 --> 00:49:52,864
? sings along ?

883
00:49:52,898 --> 00:49:55,967
? you're gonna be knowing ?

884
00:49:56,001 --> 00:49:58,970
[Music fades out]

885
00:50:02,808 --> 00:50:07,078
Every contact leaves a trace.

886
00:50:07,112 --> 00:50:10,882
Everything
and everyone we touch...

887
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,858
is changed in some way.

888
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:23,461
[Sighs]

889
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,601
But the changes...

890
00:50:37,009 --> 00:50:41,012
they are never
what we anticipate.

891
00:50:44,149 --> 00:50:47,051
That's right,
I believe Hannah McKay

892
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:51,088
was just in Miami going under
the alias of "Maggie Castner."

893
00:50:57,796 --> 00:50:59,797
Hannah.

894
00:51:08,574 --> 00:51:11,842
Don't go.

895
00:51:11,877 --> 00:51:14,845
Stay with me.

896
00:51:22,142 --> 00:51:32,661
