3
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:48,286
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

4
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,455
I should be focused on
who bludgeoned Cassie and why.

5
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,024
But instead,

6
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:54,258
ever since Hannah came back
into my orbit,

7
00:01:54,293 --> 00:01:57,795
she's all I can think about.

8
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:00,131
Have you seen that kid
around Cassie?

9
00:02:00,165 --> 00:02:01,198
I don't know him.

10
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,800
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:04,669
Joey, my friend was murdered.

12
00:02:04,703 --> 00:02:06,270
Once they catch the killer,

13
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:08,339
you're not gonna have
to be scared anymore, okay?

14
00:02:08,373 --> 00:02:09,507
You know if it were Deb
asking you to stay,

15
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,642
you wouldn't
even put up a fight.

16
00:02:11,677 --> 00:02:13,944
She'd want to catch the killer
as bad as I do.

17
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:15,680
Sorry I'm not Deb.

18
00:02:15,714 --> 00:02:17,448
I think Hannah McKay
is back in Miami.

19
00:02:17,482 --> 00:02:18,949
Are you interested or not?

20
00:02:18,984 --> 00:02:19,950
Very.

21
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:21,552
What are you doing here?

22
00:02:21,586 --> 00:02:24,155
I came here for her.

23
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:25,523
Who the fuck are you?

24
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:27,224
Who the fuck are you?

25
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:28,392
I don't wanna know.

26
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:30,161
I don't want to
know anything else ever.

27
00:02:30,195 --> 00:02:31,896
She's your problem now.

28
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,632
I can't go to jail, Hannah.

29
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,133
Lose my kids again?
I couldn't take it.

30
00:02:36,168 --> 00:02:39,370
We've always stuck together.

31
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:41,972
That's not gonna change now,
is it?

32
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:45,543
I found your blood
underneath Cassie's fingernails.

33
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:47,878
Zach had nothing to do
with Cassie's murder.

34
00:02:47,913 --> 00:02:49,246
So how did my blood
end up there?

35
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:51,215
Your plane leaves at 8:00.

36
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:54,018
27 minutes later
you'll land in Nassau.

37
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:55,986
From there, where you go
is up to you.

38
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:58,322
Where do you think you'll go?

39
00:02:58,357 --> 00:02:59,523
I haven't decided.

40
00:02:59,558 --> 00:03:00,758
Argentina?

41
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:10,434
Every contact leaves a trace.

42
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:13,371
But the changes--they're never
what we anticipate.

43
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:15,406
I believe Hannah McKay
was just in Miami

44
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,608
going under the alias
of Maggie Castner.

45
00:03:17,642 --> 00:03:20,644
Stay with me.

46
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,834
I just want to stay here
with you.

47
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:48,205
I know, but you can't.

48
00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:52,343
Dexter, I'm so sorry
about Zach.

49
00:03:52,377 --> 00:03:53,944
I know how much he meant
to you.

50
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:58,883
I need to see Dr. Vogel
and figure out our next move.

51
00:04:00,218 --> 00:04:03,020
You should stay here,
inside, out of view.

52
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:05,923
But I have to see Arlene
this afternoon after her shift.

53
00:04:05,957 --> 00:04:07,291
Why?

54
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:08,559
It's not safe for me
to draw money

55
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:10,828
out of Maggie Castner's
bank account anymore.

56
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:13,297
The only money I have is

57
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:15,633
what I've been sending away
to Arlene to hold for me.

58
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:18,169
And I'm gonna need
that money to...

59
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:21,505
Start a new life.

60
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,941
Okay.

61
00:04:23,975 --> 00:04:27,211
"Be careful."
I know.

62
00:04:31,516 --> 00:04:36,320
Actually I was gonna say,
"I love you."

63
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:39,623
I love you too.

64
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:47,731
Poor child.

65
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:50,734
I'm gonna have to find a way
to let the family know.

66
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:52,970
Just give me a little time

67
00:04:53,004 --> 00:04:55,639
before Miami Metro
gets brought in.

68
00:04:55,674 --> 00:04:57,341
I will.

69
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,144
This is the song
that was playing

70
00:05:00,178 --> 00:05:01,679
when I found Zach's body.

71
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:08,652
Do you know it?

72
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:10,387
Yes, of course.
I used to play it all the time.

73
00:05:10,422 --> 00:05:12,323
Still do.

74
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:13,858
Does it mean anything?

75
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:16,627
It's just a pleasant song.

76
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:19,196
But possibly some of my patients
heard me playing it.

77
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,865
? They may try and sell ya ?

78
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,272
There are some signs
of a struggle.

79
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:32,376
They fought here.

80
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,445
This table was out of place.

81
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,215
But whoever did this
cleaned up after himself.

82
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,451
There's no blood.

83
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:43,254
I wish I could understand
what this is all about,

84
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:44,788
why he's doing this.

85
00:05:44,823 --> 00:05:48,792
I mean, it's clearly not simply
to frighten me.

86
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:50,060
He's trying to send a message.

87
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:51,462
But what is the message?

88
00:05:51,496 --> 00:05:52,696
I don't care
what his message is.

89
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:54,031
He killed Zach.

90
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:56,400
He broke into my apartment
and dumped his body there.

91
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:57,635
What if Harrison
had been home?

92
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:01,872
I will find who did this,
and I will kill him.

93
00:06:01,907 --> 00:06:04,475
I'm sure you will, Dexter.

94
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:07,478
But you need
to remain focused.

95
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:10,848
I am focused.

96
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,021
Blood.

97
00:06:17,055 --> 00:06:18,522
He missed it.

98
00:06:18,557 --> 00:06:23,527
And a few hairs pulled out
by the roots.

99
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,500
There's a big fingerprint
in the middle of it all.

100
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:31,502
Zach's, most likely.

101
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:37,508
Almost like
it was put there deliberately.

102
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:39,510
Zach learned from me.

103
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:41,812
He knew the importance of DNA.

104
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:43,847
It's possible
that he ripped these hairs

105
00:06:43,882 --> 00:06:45,516
from whoever attacked him

106
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,217
and stuck them there
for me to find.

107
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:50,354
If this is a clue,
as you said,

108
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:51,522
then Zach acted

109
00:06:51,556 --> 00:06:56,694
with extraordinary calm,
rational thought.

110
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:58,562
Yes.

111
00:06:58,597 --> 00:07:01,298
Something I'm not sure
you're doing right now, Dexter.

112
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,133
What?

113
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:04,902
Your desire
to avenge Zach's death,

114
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:08,939
that's an emotional response,

115
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:13,010
possibly fueled by having to
say good-bye to Hannah.

116
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:15,546
I didn't say good-bye to her.

117
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,314
How do you mean?

118
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:20,484
We're going to make
a life together.

119
00:07:20,518 --> 00:07:23,087
Dexter, how?

120
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:24,121
I don't know.

121
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:27,825
We'll figure it out.

122
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:33,030
Over the time
I've spent with you,

123
00:07:33,064 --> 00:07:34,598
I've come to realize
that you're not

124
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:39,536
the perfect psychopath
I thought you were.

125
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:43,507
You have a depth of emotion
I never thought possible.

126
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,311
It's true.

127
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:49,446
I'll find the brain surgeon.

128
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:52,016
And I'll kill him.

129
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,987
But once I do I'm gonna
focus on a life with Hannah.

130
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:02,326
I think you
misunderstood my point.

131
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,929
Straddling two worlds
as you are, it's dangerous.

132
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:10,234
Killers cannot have
a full emotional life.

133
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:14,972
I think you
underestimate me.

134
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:22,813
So this is Maggie Castner's
passport photo.

135
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:24,214
That's Hannah McKay's.

136
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:25,349
I won't even ask
how you got those.

137
00:08:25,383 --> 00:08:27,351
Good. Please don't.

138
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:29,386
They look
pretty much the same.

139
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:30,921
Have you had contact?

140
00:08:30,955 --> 00:08:32,389
I have not.

141
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:33,691
Her boat left
for St. Kitt's yesterday,

142
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:35,793
but I don't think
she was on it.

143
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:38,328
What makes you think that?

144
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:39,630
Just a hunch.

145
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:41,965
A lot of good that does me.
What about her husband?

146
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,300
Supposedly in New York City,

147
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:44,802
but there's no record of
his jet ever landing there,

148
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:47,738
much less taking off from here,
so...don't know.

149
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:49,973
All right, then.
I'll look into this.

150
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:51,675
There's, uh...
There's one more thing.

151
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,711
I'd actually like to be a part
of the team on this one.

152
00:08:55,213 --> 00:08:57,981
Thanks, but the Marshal Service
doesn't really take on partners.

153
00:08:58,016 --> 00:09:00,517
- I understand, but--
- If I do happen to find her

154
00:09:00,552 --> 00:09:03,921
you'll get your reward money.

155
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:04,922
Fair enough.

156
00:09:04,956 --> 00:09:07,191
All right.

157
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:11,695
Deb.

158
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,898
Hey.

159
00:09:17,702 --> 00:09:21,038
I saw you from my car and I--
I had this moment

160
00:09:21,072 --> 00:09:24,141
where it was
just like old times.

161
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:26,710
Tell me you're here
to see me.

162
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:28,712
Quinn, actually.

163
00:09:28,747 --> 00:09:30,514
I meant what I said
the other day.

164
00:09:30,548 --> 00:09:32,382
We'd love you
to come back with us.

165
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:34,151
I just don't think
Matthews would go for it.

166
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:35,519
He was pissed that I left
so abruptly.

167
00:09:35,553 --> 00:09:39,189
You never know, Deb.

168
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:43,393
I'll leave you two be.

169
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:44,428
Thanks for coming.

170
00:09:44,462 --> 00:09:46,697
I need to, uh,
ask you for a favor.

171
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:47,931
Yeah. Anything.

172
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:49,733
I think I know
who Cassie's killer is,

173
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:51,401
but Matthews asked me
to lay off.

174
00:09:51,436 --> 00:09:52,870
The guy's from
this rich fuckin' family.

175
00:09:52,904 --> 00:09:55,272
So I was wondering if you could
look into him for me.

176
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:57,174
Sure. This all you have?

177
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,943
Yup. His info.

178
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:04,448
Social, address,
his name's Zach Hamilton.

179
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:06,216
Kid's a fucking serial killer
in the making.

180
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:10,521
I think Cassie's
the second person he killed.

181
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:13,724
Yeah, I will--
I'll get right on it.

182
00:10:13,758 --> 00:10:17,094
I'm gonna go
say hello to Dexter.

183
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:21,565
The sooner I can
identify Zach's killer

184
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,267
the sooner I can
be done with all this

185
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:26,737
and get back to Hannah.

186
00:10:28,807 --> 00:10:29,773
Excuse me,
you can't go in there.

187
00:10:29,808 --> 00:10:31,975
Sorry.
Who the fuck are you?

188
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,878
Hey, hey, hold it.

189
00:10:34,913 --> 00:10:37,147
Deb, this is
my daughter Niki.

190
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:41,451
Niki, this is
former Lieutenant Debra Morgan.

191
00:10:41,486 --> 00:10:43,921
Oh, shit. Sorry.

192
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:44,922
My dad says that
you're, like, a total rock star.

193
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:47,324
Why'd you leave?

194
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:49,593
She's a curious one.
Come on.

195
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:51,929
Let's go see someone else.
Nice to meet you.

196
00:10:57,802 --> 00:11:00,571
What the fuck are you doing
with Zach Hamilton?

197
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:01,572
Quinn called.

198
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:04,675
He thinks Zach killed Cassie.

199
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:10,647
I thought so too,
but I checked it out.

200
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:12,449
Zach didn't.

201
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:16,787
What was Zach doing
with you and Hannah in the keys?

202
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:18,989
Serial killers convention?

203
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:23,794
I was helping
Dr. Vogel out.

204
00:11:23,828 --> 00:11:27,764
I don't know why I even
ask you these questions.

205
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:33,770
No one else knows.

206
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:35,873
Zach's dead.

207
00:11:40,345 --> 00:11:44,114
Now I know.

208
00:11:44,148 --> 00:11:45,816
I don't want to know,
'cause now I'm gonna have to

209
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,217
explain how I know.

210
00:11:47,252 --> 00:11:50,153
Kind of, yes.

211
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:53,891
I was thinking
about coming back here.

212
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:55,826
About being a detective again,

213
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,831
doing something good
for a change.

214
00:12:00,865 --> 00:12:03,834
But it'll just lead me

215
00:12:03,868 --> 00:12:07,971
into another fucked up
situation, won't it?

216
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:27,491
A familial match.

217
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:31,929
...to Dr. Evelyn Vogel?

218
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:33,730
What?

219
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:36,600
The hairs we found
in Zach's studio--

220
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:38,669
I ran a mitochondrial DNA
match on them.

221
00:12:38,703 --> 00:12:41,238
It tests a person's mother line.
Yeah, I'm aware of this test.

222
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:43,707
Well, it's a direct
match to you.

223
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:47,177
Zach's killer
is related to you.

224
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:51,048
The brain surgeon
is related to you.

225
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:52,382
But how is that possible?

226
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:55,852
I have no family.

227
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:57,387
Well, not anymore.

228
00:12:57,422 --> 00:12:58,555
Anymore.

229
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:00,791
Well, I was married
and I had two sons.

230
00:13:00,825 --> 00:13:02,793
Daniel and Richard.

231
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:03,961
And now?

232
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:05,696
They're gone.

233
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,266
What happened to them?

234
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:14,271
One day I found Richard--
he was my youngest--

235
00:13:14,305 --> 00:13:16,373
at the bottom
of our swimming pool, dead.

236
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:18,542
At first I thought
it was an accident.

237
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:20,477
He wasn't a strong swimmer.

238
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,879
Then I realized the truth.

239
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:27,417
My older son Daniel,

240
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:29,853
he...

241
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:31,855
He killed Richard.

242
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:33,957
Yes.

243
00:13:33,992 --> 00:13:37,894
Daniel was--
Daniel was highly intelligent.

244
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:42,599
But he was
also very troubled.

245
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:45,268
Oh, it was
much more than that.

246
00:13:45,303 --> 00:13:48,372
He was devoid of empathy,

247
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:49,773
had a complete lack of fear,

248
00:13:49,807 --> 00:13:54,745
of the sense
of right and wrong.

249
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,580
He was a psychopath.

250
00:13:56,614 --> 00:14:00,417
Realizing this and wanting to

251
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:04,021
find a way to help Daniel
led me into this field.

252
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:15,799
I failed Daniel, I--

253
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:19,870
I was never
able to treat him.

254
00:14:19,904 --> 00:14:24,041
Maybe that's one reason
I was so determined to help you.

255
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:25,509
This is Daniel.

256
00:14:25,543 --> 00:14:29,546
My husband and I covered up his
involvement in Richard's death.

257
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,883
Said it was an accident,
and...

258
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:36,453
Then we put Daniel
into a mental health institute.

259
00:14:36,487 --> 00:14:39,056
He was only 14.

260
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,757
- Here in Miami?
- No.

261
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:44,661
No, I sent him
back to England.

262
00:14:44,695 --> 00:14:47,864
Three years later
he was dead.

263
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:50,467
How?

264
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:54,004
A fire broke out in the wing
where Daniel was living.

265
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:55,439
Some idiot nurse
had left the door locked

266
00:14:55,473 --> 00:14:57,941
to take a coffee break.

267
00:14:57,975 --> 00:14:59,643
The children
couldn't get out.

268
00:14:59,677 --> 00:15:00,877
Seven of them perished.

269
00:15:00,912 --> 00:15:03,880
One of them was Daniel.

270
00:15:03,915 --> 00:15:05,849
Did you see the body?

271
00:15:05,883 --> 00:15:08,685
No. My husband did.

272
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:13,457
He was horribly burned.

273
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:15,192
If it was his body.

274
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:17,394
That's preposterous,
Dexter.

275
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:18,929
He can't be alive.

276
00:15:18,963 --> 00:15:21,398
You said yourself
he's highly intelligent.

277
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:22,933
Could've faked his death.

278
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:24,901
But after all these years...

279
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:28,371
Why would he do
these terrible things now?

280
00:15:28,406 --> 00:15:31,608
The brain cores.

281
00:15:31,642 --> 00:15:34,244
Do they mean
anything to you?

282
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:37,647
Well...

283
00:15:37,682 --> 00:15:40,817
Well, even as a child,
Daniel was...

284
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:45,455
aware that he lacked empathy

285
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,793
and how I felt about it.

286
00:15:49,827 --> 00:15:54,798
It's possible he boxed some up
and left it at my door.

287
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:11,781
Daniel Vogel would be
in his mid-40s.

288
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:24,928
Anybody. Nobody.

289
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,110
That guy Cassie was dating.

290
00:16:40,144 --> 00:16:42,512
He was interviewed that night.

291
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:51,454
Oliver Saxon.

292
00:17:00,698 --> 00:17:03,533
Is it possible
this is Vogel's son?

293
00:17:13,344 --> 00:17:17,013
Daniel Vogel
is Oliver Saxon.

294
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:19,149
You created
half a dozen fake I.D.s.

295
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:20,617
He could've done the same.

296
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:25,622
The easiest way is to assume
the identity of a dead person.

297
00:17:28,626 --> 00:17:31,027
Oliver Saxon,
death certificate.

298
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:32,195
The guy's a fake.

299
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,431
Doesn't mean
he's your brain surgeon.

300
00:17:34,465 --> 00:17:38,268
I need to get
a DNA sample from him.

301
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:44,641
Dexter, this is
Deputy Marshal Clayton.

302
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:48,345
He's here on a tip that
Hannah McKay is back in Miami.

303
00:17:48,379 --> 00:17:50,814
Uh, sorry if I don't
seem glad to meet you.

304
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:52,782
This is kind of a shock.

305
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:54,150
I guess that means
you haven't talked to her.

306
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:56,052
Why would I?

307
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:57,520
I told him
that you dated Hannah

308
00:17:57,555 --> 00:18:00,657
before you turned her in
for the Sal Price murders.

309
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:02,626
Wasn't the smoothest
breakup.

310
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,195
I guess not.
And that makes you a target.

311
00:18:07,164 --> 00:18:10,667
Frankly,
the Hannah McKay I knew

312
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:13,069
would be too smart to risk
coming back to Miami.

313
00:18:13,104 --> 00:18:15,071
Could be.

314
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:16,673
Look, I got no definite
information she's here.

315
00:18:16,707 --> 00:18:18,174
I'm just
following up on a tip.

316
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:20,243
Yeah, but until
we know for sure,

317
00:18:20,278 --> 00:18:23,246
I think we should put unis
on you just till this plays out.

318
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:25,081
That's the last thing I need

319
00:18:25,116 --> 00:18:26,683
while I'm trying
to help Hannah stay hidden.

320
00:18:26,717 --> 00:18:28,952
On the other hand, the brain
surgeon's still out there.

321
00:18:28,986 --> 00:18:30,487
And he knows where I live.

322
00:18:30,521 --> 00:18:32,989
Yeah, but I don't
need unis to watch me,

323
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:35,358
just my apartment and my son
when he goes to school.

324
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:37,861
Don't worry. We're gonna
watch Harrison like a hawk.

325
00:18:37,895 --> 00:18:40,297
Deputy Marshal Clayton...

326
00:18:40,331 --> 00:18:42,932
How do you plan to find Hannah
even if she is here?

327
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:44,934
Well, I'm getting her picture
out with the local media

328
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:47,103
asking anyone to call us
if they spot her.

329
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:49,072
'Kay.

330
00:18:49,106 --> 00:18:50,840
But if by some chance
she decides

331
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,576
you two need
to talk things over,

332
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:55,178
be sure and give me a call,
won't you?

333
00:18:55,212 --> 00:18:56,513
Of course.

334
00:18:56,547 --> 00:18:58,381
Believe me, I want her
behind bars as much as you do.

335
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,084
Okay.

336
00:19:07,425 --> 00:19:10,226
This is exactly
what Vogel warned you about.

337
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:12,562
Trying to straddle
both worlds.

338
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:14,798
You should be following up
on Saxon right now.

339
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,600
Let Hannah handle
her own problems.

340
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:18,601
I can do both.

341
00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:25,375
Hey.

342
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:27,043
Have you gone
to see Arlene yet?

343
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:28,411
No, I was
just about to leave.

344
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:31,147
Don't. I just had
a federal marshal in my office.

345
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:33,083
They know you're here.

346
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:34,484
Oh, God.

347
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:36,886
You can't go to Arlene's.
You need to lay low.

348
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:40,657
Dexter, I can't start
a new life without that money.

349
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:44,361
- I can give you money.
- $1/2 million?

350
00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:46,129
Well, no.

351
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:49,999
Look, I'll drive you, I'm not
letting you go by yourself.

352
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:51,568
Okay, but hurry.

353
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:05,248
This marshal
changes everything.

354
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:07,283
We can never
be together here.

355
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:09,018
I know.

356
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:10,787
What are we gonna do?

357
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:15,225
Let's get your money,
and we'll figure that out later.

358
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:19,629
You were right.

359
00:20:19,663 --> 00:20:22,432
The hotel manager in Key West
positively I.D. Ed Zach.

360
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:23,867
He was down there
when she was killed.

361
00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:25,668
Where the fuck do you
get your information from?

362
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:28,905
I have my sources.

363
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:29,906
Wish I had your sources.

364
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,208
Thought I had
this one nailed.

365
00:20:32,243 --> 00:20:34,878
Well, you're at square one.
You've been there before.

366
00:20:34,912 --> 00:20:36,613
You'll close it.

367
00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:40,049
Just after the whole
Sergeant Dick dance, you know,

368
00:20:40,084 --> 00:20:41,251
I feel like I got
something to prove.

369
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:42,819
You're a good cop, Joe,

370
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:45,889
you don't have to
prove anything to anybody.

371
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:47,323
Then there's Jamie,
you know,

372
00:20:47,358 --> 00:20:49,826
I kind of want
to solve it for her.

373
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,128
She was really close
to Cassie.

374
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:53,430
Yeah.

375
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:55,865
And I just haven't
been there for her lately.

376
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,368
What do you mean?
I thought she moved in.

377
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:00,937
I mean, like, emotionally.

378
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:02,439
Come on, since when
are you Mr. Sensitive?

379
00:21:02,473 --> 00:21:03,606
Fuck you, okay?

380
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:05,275
God.

381
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:08,745
It pours right out of you.

382
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:10,914
You know,
she's always accusing me

383
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:13,616
of comparing you to her.

384
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:18,154
Oh. Um...

385
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:21,124
Well, I mean, I can't really
advise you on that.

386
00:21:21,158 --> 00:21:22,125
Puts me in
an awkward position.

387
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,293
Why is that?

388
00:21:23,327 --> 00:21:25,395
Because of our history,
asshole.

389
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:28,331
I mean, history is history,
right?

390
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:33,937
Jamie knew Cassie
better than anyone,

391
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:35,238
so maybe you should
question her again.

392
00:21:35,272 --> 00:21:37,040
Maybe something'll turn up.

393
00:21:37,074 --> 00:21:38,308
She's just been a wreck
about the whole thing.

394
00:21:38,342 --> 00:21:39,709
It's kind of hard
to walk the line

395
00:21:39,743 --> 00:21:41,211
between caring boyfriend
and hard-nosed cop.

396
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:42,779
I'll talk to her.

397
00:21:42,813 --> 00:21:44,781
- Really?
- Yeah.

398
00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:45,882
Be fun to play cop again.

399
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,650
That'd be great. Thanks.

400
00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:49,385
You can buy me lunch.

401
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,422
And two fuckin' desserts.

402
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:05,335
This is a nice place.

403
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:06,503
Yeah, I found that
when you're a fugitive

404
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:08,471
asking somebody to hold
$1/2 million for you,

405
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:09,906
incentives are helpful.

406
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,441
So Arlene gets a cut?

407
00:22:11,475 --> 00:22:14,277
She gets what she needs
to keep the kids off welfare,

408
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:15,445
and I get--
the Bank of Arlene.

409
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:16,813
Exactly.

410
00:22:16,847 --> 00:22:20,316
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, Arlene.

411
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:23,253
Aren't you
the asshole who turned her in?

412
00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:26,756
- That would be me.
- Long story.

413
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,757
Can we come in?

414
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:28,758
Yeah.

415
00:22:31,795 --> 00:22:35,098
So now we're
back together, huh?

416
00:22:35,132 --> 00:22:37,934
How's that gonna work out?

417
00:22:37,968 --> 00:22:40,904
We're figuring it out.

418
00:22:40,938 --> 00:22:42,438
I told the kids
there's snakes in here

419
00:22:42,473 --> 00:22:44,774
so they wouldn't go near it.

420
00:22:44,808 --> 00:22:46,743
There you go.

421
00:22:46,777 --> 00:22:48,144
Oh, shit.

422
00:22:48,178 --> 00:22:51,114
Who's that?

423
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:53,917
Federal marshal.

424
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:55,518
Stay here. I'll handle this.

425
00:22:55,553 --> 00:23:00,523
You answer the door.
Come with me.

426
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,327
Like you've got
nothing to hide.

427
00:23:14,638 --> 00:23:15,638
Can I help you?

428
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:16,673
Yeah, I'm Deputy
Marshal Clayton.

429
00:23:16,707 --> 00:23:19,442
You mind if I ask you
a few questions?

430
00:23:19,476 --> 00:23:22,145
Uh, yeah.

431
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:27,483
Dexter Morgan.

432
00:23:27,518 --> 00:23:30,153
What the hell
are you doing here?

433
00:23:30,187 --> 00:23:31,154
Arlene's a friend.

434
00:23:31,188 --> 00:23:33,957
We met through Hannah.

435
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:36,259
Really, now?

436
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:37,694
Yeah, I just stopped by
to tell her what you told me,

437
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,762
that Hannah might be
back in Miami.

438
00:23:39,797 --> 00:23:42,265
Yeah, I gotta keep
an extra eye on the kids.

439
00:23:44,535 --> 00:23:46,703
Looks like you, uh,
recently changed your address.

440
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:48,004
It seems like a step up.

441
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:50,707
Better school district.

442
00:23:50,741 --> 00:23:53,109
It says here you work part
time waiting tables at Denny's.

443
00:23:53,143 --> 00:23:54,677
That's right.

444
00:23:54,712 --> 00:23:55,878
That won't buy you
a doll's house,

445
00:23:55,913 --> 00:23:57,447
let alone pay the rent
on this place.

446
00:23:57,481 --> 00:24:00,083
You sure you haven't
gotten any help

447
00:24:00,117 --> 00:24:01,751
from your friend
Hannah McKay,

448
00:24:01,785 --> 00:24:03,086
who just happened
to have married a man

449
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,554
worth over $1/2 billion?

450
00:24:04,588 --> 00:24:06,723
Didn't even know
she was married.

451
00:24:06,757 --> 00:24:08,825
It says here
you got a record.

452
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:10,526
Do you have any idea
how many years

453
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:12,128
aiding and abetting
a fugitive will buy you?

454
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:16,132
Look, I'm the one
who's been...

455
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:19,068
helping out Arlene.

456
00:24:21,672 --> 00:24:26,509
Now I see
what you two really bonded over.

457
00:24:26,543 --> 00:24:29,846
You sure can pick 'em.

458
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,681
Listen, do me a favor.

459
00:24:31,715 --> 00:24:34,283
Either of you hear from
your old friend Hannah McKay,

460
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:35,852
you give me a call.

461
00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:37,487
- Of course.
- Yeah, we will.

462
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:55,371
Hey, Deb.
Dexter's not here.

463
00:24:55,406 --> 00:24:57,473
I know,
I was just driving by

464
00:24:57,508 --> 00:24:59,242
and I wanted to say hello
to the little man.

465
00:24:59,276 --> 00:25:00,343
Oh.

466
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:01,844
Look, Aunt Deb,
I can write my name.

467
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:05,114
That's awesome.

468
00:25:07,618 --> 00:25:11,087
I am so sorry about Cassie.

469
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:14,590
You doing okay
working here and everything?

470
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:17,627
Honestly, no.
Not really.

471
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:19,929
I mean, the cops are watching
the place, which helps.

472
00:25:19,963 --> 00:25:22,231
She have a lot of friends?

473
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:24,867
Yeah.
She's pretty popular.

474
00:25:24,902 --> 00:25:27,270
Everyone's just in shock,
you know?

475
00:25:27,304 --> 00:25:31,374
Especially Oliver.
Who's that?

476
00:25:31,408 --> 00:25:35,078
This guy Cassie was dating.

477
00:25:35,112 --> 00:25:37,013
Were they dating
for a long time?

478
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:38,915
Just a couple weeks.

479
00:25:38,949 --> 00:25:40,950
I guess it was love
at first sight.

480
00:25:40,984 --> 00:25:41,951
At least for him.

481
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:43,720
What do you mean,
"for him"?

482
00:25:43,754 --> 00:25:46,255
Between us, I think
Cassie was actually gonna

483
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,725
break it off with Oliver,
but then he was all,

484
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:50,626
"we should go to
the Bahamas for a week."

485
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:52,395
Bahamas after
two weeks of dating?

486
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:54,897
Yeah, he just kept
pushing her into it.

487
00:25:54,932 --> 00:25:56,065
He would not take no
for an answer.

488
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,101
You weren't a fan of his,
I take it.

489
00:25:58,135 --> 00:26:00,837
Sometimes I just thought
he could be a little clingy.

490
00:26:00,871 --> 00:26:04,574
But he was great to Cassie.

491
00:26:04,608 --> 00:26:06,743
Hey, we should all
have someone

492
00:26:06,777 --> 00:26:08,311
who worships us
like that, right?

493
00:26:11,248 --> 00:26:14,417
When was the trip to
the Bahamas supposed to happen?

494
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:17,453
This week, I think.

495
00:26:19,656 --> 00:26:23,292
Hey.

496
00:26:23,327 --> 00:26:24,994
Quinn, it's me.
I just talked to Jamie.

497
00:26:25,028 --> 00:26:27,230
I think we need
to revisit the boyfriend.

498
00:26:27,264 --> 00:26:28,965
Oliver Saxon.

499
00:26:33,203 --> 00:26:35,938
So you think Clayton
bought your little story?

500
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:37,673
I'm not sure.

501
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:40,042
Either way, he's got
your photo all over Miami.

502
00:26:40,077 --> 00:26:41,778
It's not safe for you
to go back to the hotel.

503
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:43,179
You need something private.

504
00:26:43,213 --> 00:26:45,114
Yeah, but where?

505
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:48,017
I do know of one place.

506
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:50,486
Something tells me it's
the last place I'll want to go.

507
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:53,456
Debra's, if I can
talk her into it.

508
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:56,626
I was right.

509
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,195
I can't think of a better
option, can you?

510
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:01,130
Unfortunately, I can't.

511
00:27:08,338 --> 00:27:10,673
You mind answering
a few more questions?

512
00:27:10,707 --> 00:27:11,741
Anything I can do
to help find

513
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:13,709
the guy who did this
to Cassie.

514
00:27:13,744 --> 00:27:15,511
This must be
really hard on you.

515
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:18,414
The last few days
have been a nightmare.

516
00:27:18,448 --> 00:27:21,417
I still can't even
believe it.

517
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:22,919
I just wish
I had time to breathe.

518
00:27:22,953 --> 00:27:24,353
I'm so busy at work.

519
00:27:24,388 --> 00:27:26,088
In fact, I'm already late
for an appointment.

520
00:27:26,123 --> 00:27:27,356
This won't take long.

521
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:29,392
What is it you do,
exactly?

522
00:27:29,426 --> 00:27:30,526
Building inspections.

523
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:31,561
And that's where you were

524
00:27:31,595 --> 00:27:32,695
at the time
of Cassie's death?

525
00:27:32,729 --> 00:27:33,963
Yes.

526
00:27:33,997 --> 00:27:35,298
You're welcome to take
a look at my workbook.

527
00:27:35,332 --> 00:27:37,733
I was in Sunny Isles,
inspecting a new condo.

528
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:39,735
Just a few minutes
away from here.

529
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:40,903
Yes.

530
00:27:40,938 --> 00:27:42,705
You must be pretty busy,
huh?

531
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:45,575
I'm booked wall to wall
for the next few weeks.

532
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:47,043
Oh, really?

533
00:27:47,077 --> 00:27:48,144
I thought you and Cassie

534
00:27:48,178 --> 00:27:50,880
were planning a trip
to the Bahamas.

535
00:27:50,914 --> 00:27:54,383
How were you gonna
work that in?

536
00:27:54,418 --> 00:27:55,718
I...

537
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:58,187
guess that was
a little crazy.

538
00:27:58,222 --> 00:27:59,722
Cassie kept pushing for it,

539
00:27:59,756 --> 00:28:01,224
and I didn't want
to disappoint her.

540
00:28:01,258 --> 00:28:02,358
Oh, it was her idea?

541
00:28:02,392 --> 00:28:03,459
Yeah.

542
00:28:03,493 --> 00:28:04,827
She really wanted
a romantic getaway.

543
00:28:04,862 --> 00:28:06,896
Seems a little fast,
don't you think?

544
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,732
After a few weeks of dating.

545
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:12,668
I know it's hard
for most people to understand,

546
00:28:12,703 --> 00:28:14,737
but we had
something special.

547
00:28:14,771 --> 00:28:17,740
And we both knew it.

548
00:28:20,043 --> 00:28:22,078
Look, I'm really sorry,
you guys.

549
00:28:22,112 --> 00:28:23,412
I've got to get going.

550
00:28:23,447 --> 00:28:24,747
Maybe we can
pick this up later?

551
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:27,016
Yeah, no.
We'll come back another time.

552
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,752
That would be great.
Thanks.

553
00:28:37,794 --> 00:28:39,395
He lied to us.

554
00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:41,130
About what?

555
00:28:41,164 --> 00:28:43,199
Jamie said that whole Bahamas
thing was his idea.

556
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:45,601
It was a way for Cassie
not to dump him.

557
00:28:45,636 --> 00:28:47,870
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
he's a killer, you know.

558
00:28:47,905 --> 00:28:50,606
I mean, he just could be
fuckin' obsessed with her.

559
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:52,308
Yeah, well, it wouldn't
hurt to look into it.

560
00:28:52,342 --> 00:28:54,710
You know, look a little deeper
into his alibi.

561
00:28:54,745 --> 00:28:56,078
I'll get on that.

562
00:28:56,113 --> 00:28:59,081
Feel that?

563
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:00,249
What?

564
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:03,319
Us, you know,
working together again.

565
00:29:03,353 --> 00:29:06,155
It's nice, you know?

566
00:29:06,189 --> 00:29:07,590
Yeah, I mean,
it's a lot better

567
00:29:07,624 --> 00:29:09,558
than doing background checks
for elway.

568
00:29:09,593 --> 00:29:13,829
- Yeah.
- I forgot how much I like it.

569
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,671
Shit.

570
00:29:21,705 --> 00:29:24,140
Ah...I'm sorry.

571
00:29:24,174 --> 00:29:25,675
I don't know why I did that.

572
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:32,148
Let's just pretend
you didn't.

573
00:29:32,182 --> 00:29:34,750
- Okay.
- Okay.

574
00:29:44,728 --> 00:29:46,295
What the fuck?

575
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:49,198
Sorry, we let ourselves in.

576
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:51,233
You two should talk alone.

577
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:12,154
I need a place
where Hannah can stay.

578
00:30:12,189 --> 00:30:16,192
And you want that to be
my place?

579
00:30:16,226 --> 00:30:20,396
There's a federal marshall
after her.

580
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,231
He knows she's in Miami.

581
00:30:22,265 --> 00:30:25,067
He's gonna do everything
he can to find her.

582
00:30:25,102 --> 00:30:27,403
It's the only move
I could think of.

583
00:30:27,437 --> 00:30:30,006
To bring Hannah
to my house?

584
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,874
I know.

585
00:30:31,908 --> 00:30:33,676
It's only for
a couple of nights.

586
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,211
Just...

587
00:30:35,245 --> 00:30:39,715
Until I can get her
out of Miami.

588
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,250
Please?

589
00:30:47,924 --> 00:30:49,458
A couple of nights,
that's it.

590
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:52,194
Thank you.

591
00:30:52,229 --> 00:30:53,863
You could also thank me
for getting Quinn

592
00:30:53,897 --> 00:30:56,232
off Zach's trail.

593
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:59,335
How?

594
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:02,872
Simple. Get him
to focus on the boyfriend.

595
00:31:02,906 --> 00:31:06,075
Oliver Saxon.

596
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:08,411
Saxon?
You think he did it?

597
00:31:08,445 --> 00:31:11,080
Well, he's a damn good
suspect.

598
00:31:11,114 --> 00:31:13,015
Quinn and I
talked to him today.

599
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:15,184
If Saxon thinks
the police are onto him,

600
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:16,886
he'll know
that I'm onto him.

601
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,888
You should stay away
from Saxon, Deb.

602
00:31:18,922 --> 00:31:22,224
He could be more dangerous
than you think.

603
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:23,893
What are you
talking about?

604
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:25,895
I can't go into it
right now,

605
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:28,264
but please just...

606
00:31:28,298 --> 00:31:30,066
do as I ask.

607
00:31:37,107 --> 00:31:38,674
I knew going back
to the force

608
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:41,877
would put me in
a fucked-up situation.

609
00:31:41,912 --> 00:31:44,346
Here it is,
ahead of schedule.

610
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:49,251
He's all yours.

611
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:08,170
You'll be okay here?

612
00:32:09,973 --> 00:32:11,941
Sure.

613
00:32:11,975 --> 00:32:13,442
We'll just hang.

614
00:32:21,852 --> 00:32:24,320
If Deb and Quinn
did anything to spook Saxon,

615
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:26,589
I have to act fast.

616
00:32:32,696 --> 00:32:35,798
I'm too late.
He's already moved out.

617
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,987
But if this has his DNA,

618
00:32:58,021 --> 00:33:02,925
I can check it against the hairs
I found at Zach's studio.

619
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,093
Here you go.

620
00:33:06,963 --> 00:33:09,665
Are we going to see
Hannah?

621
00:33:09,699 --> 00:33:11,500
Hannah? Why?

622
00:33:11,535 --> 00:33:12,568
I saw her on TV.

623
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:14,436
They said people
are looking for her.

624
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:17,206
Is she in trouble?

625
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,341
No, she's fine.
Hannah's...

626
00:33:19,376 --> 00:33:21,510
just popular.

627
00:33:23,146 --> 00:33:24,446
You miss her?

628
00:33:24,481 --> 00:33:26,282
Yeah.

629
00:33:26,316 --> 00:33:28,117
I liked playing with her.

630
00:33:28,151 --> 00:33:30,019
She was nice.

631
00:33:30,053 --> 00:33:34,757
I wish she could
be my mom.

632
00:34:00,784 --> 00:34:02,384
It's a match.

633
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:04,186
Saxon is Vogel's son.

634
00:34:12,996 --> 00:34:14,096
Daniel.

635
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,665
He's going by the name
of Oliver Saxon.

636
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,068
He was dating my neighbor
until he killed her

637
00:34:19,102 --> 00:34:21,570
in her apartment
two doors down from mine.

638
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:23,439
Do you have any idea
where he is?

639
00:34:23,473 --> 00:34:25,941
No, he cleared out
of his place.

640
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:28,510
He could be anywhere
right now.

641
00:34:28,545 --> 00:34:31,380
Suppose you do find him,
Dexter.

642
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:32,514
What are you going to do?

643
00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:34,683
What do you think?

644
00:34:34,718 --> 00:34:36,919
I don't know
how I feel about that.

645
00:34:36,953 --> 00:34:39,088
He's murdered
four innocent people,

646
00:34:39,122 --> 00:34:41,123
and he killed
Zach Hamilton.

647
00:34:43,326 --> 00:34:44,460
He's my son.

648
00:34:44,494 --> 00:34:47,863
There's nothing
you can do for him.

649
00:34:47,897 --> 00:34:49,798
I can--I can try

650
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:51,533
putting him back
into a safe facility

651
00:34:51,568 --> 00:34:54,103
where he can't hurt himself
or anyone else.

652
00:34:54,137 --> 00:34:55,571
I'm not going to let you
kill him, Dexter.

653
00:34:55,605 --> 00:34:56,705
I'm sorry.

654
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,641
You brought me into this.

655
00:34:58,675 --> 00:35:00,542
Because I didn't know
who he was then.

656
00:35:00,577 --> 00:35:05,114
Try and understand,
my youngest son is gone forever.

657
00:35:05,148 --> 00:35:08,150
Maybe I have a second chance
with Daniel?

658
00:35:08,184 --> 00:35:10,119
You really believe that?

659
00:35:10,153 --> 00:35:12,388
You have a son.

660
00:35:12,422 --> 00:35:14,223
Wouldn't you believe it?

661
00:35:14,257 --> 00:35:18,127
This second chance she wants
could get us both killed.

662
00:35:18,161 --> 00:35:19,995
But, for her own sake,
I have to tell her

663
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,130
what she wants to hear.

664
00:35:21,164 --> 00:35:22,631
Fine, we'll do it
your way.

665
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:25,901
Just...
Help me find him.

666
00:35:25,935 --> 00:35:28,604
Is there a way
to reach out to him?

667
00:35:28,638 --> 00:35:30,839
I don't know.

668
00:35:30,874 --> 00:35:33,609
Think.

669
00:35:33,643 --> 00:35:35,644
The Mama Cass song

670
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,746
that he left playing
in your apartment...

671
00:35:37,781 --> 00:35:39,014
What about it?

672
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:40,883
One of the few happy memories
I have with Daniel

673
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:42,851
was when he was a little boy,
and every Saturday,

674
00:35:42,886 --> 00:35:44,987
I'd take him
to the King's Bay Cafe

675
00:35:45,021 --> 00:35:46,622
in the marina.

676
00:35:46,656 --> 00:35:49,491
There was a juke box there.

677
00:35:49,526 --> 00:35:53,162
And Daniel would
always play that song.

678
00:35:53,196 --> 00:35:55,164
Maybe it's more
than a happy memory.

679
00:35:55,198 --> 00:35:58,067
Maybe it's an invitation.

680
00:35:58,101 --> 00:36:00,469
King's Bay Cafe.
It's still there.

681
00:36:04,174 --> 00:36:08,143
Saxon's been one step
ahead of us this whole time.

682
00:36:08,178 --> 00:36:12,147
We know he stole
your computer files.

683
00:36:12,182 --> 00:36:14,483
But how could he have known
about Zach Hamilton?

684
00:36:14,517 --> 00:36:16,819
We met him after that.

685
00:36:16,853 --> 00:36:19,154
The detailed notes that
you keep on your computer...

686
00:36:19,189 --> 00:36:20,756
Yes?

687
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,059
I think Saxon's
been monitoring your laptop.

688
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:26,161
It wouldn't be hard.

689
00:36:26,196 --> 00:36:28,130
You just need
the right spyware.

690
00:36:28,164 --> 00:36:29,398
We can use this.

691
00:36:29,432 --> 00:36:30,799
Write an entry
in your journal

692
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:32,935
saying that you're going
to the King's Bay Cafe

693
00:36:32,969 --> 00:36:34,203
tomorrow morning.

694
00:36:34,237 --> 00:36:35,971
And you think he'll read it
and go there?

695
00:36:36,005 --> 00:36:37,172
Well, you said yourself
he's been trying

696
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:39,074
to send you a message.

697
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:41,744
He wants to see you.

698
00:36:56,826 --> 00:36:58,694
I don't like
deceiving Vogel.

699
00:36:58,728 --> 00:37:01,497
But if it's the only way
to get to Saxon...

700
00:37:05,235 --> 00:37:06,535
You had no choice, Dex.

701
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:09,271
You had to lie to her.

702
00:37:09,305 --> 00:37:10,606
I just
can't believe Vogel

703
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,108
still thinks her son
can be helped.

704
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:16,378
Well, it's not that crazy.

705
00:37:16,413 --> 00:37:18,781
After everything
he's done.

706
00:37:18,815 --> 00:37:21,250
You would want to
help Harrison, wouldn't you?

707
00:37:22,385 --> 00:37:25,120
Vogel pretty much
made the same point.

708
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:26,822
She's right.
I mean, look at what

709
00:37:26,856 --> 00:37:30,359
your own father did
to protect you.

710
00:37:34,998 --> 00:37:38,600
Right or not,
Saxon needs to be stopped.

711
00:37:38,635 --> 00:37:41,904
I'm putting him
on my table.

712
00:37:41,938 --> 00:37:44,740
And how is Vogel
going to feel about that?

713
00:37:44,774 --> 00:37:46,809
I can't worry
about it now.

714
00:37:46,843 --> 00:37:49,011
At least she'll be alive.

715
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:54,550
Well, you'll
figure it out.

716
00:37:57,887 --> 00:38:02,491
I'm glad you're here.

717
00:38:02,525 --> 00:38:04,126
I want to be able

718
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,829
to keep being here
for you, Dex.

719
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:13,469
But?

720
00:38:13,503 --> 00:38:15,704
But there's no life
for me here in Florida.

721
00:38:15,738 --> 00:38:18,273
We both know it.

722
00:38:21,411 --> 00:38:23,045
I can have a life
somewhere else

723
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:25,247
far away from here...

724
00:38:25,281 --> 00:38:28,784
in Argentina.

725
00:38:28,818 --> 00:38:32,254
Maybe we all can.

726
00:38:32,288 --> 00:38:34,556
You and Harrison
could meet me there.

727
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:37,125
We can start over.

728
00:38:39,562 --> 00:38:42,598
It would be hard on Harrison
to uproot his whole life.

729
00:38:42,632 --> 00:38:43,832
At first, it might be,

730
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:45,701
but sometimes
change is a good thing.

731
00:38:45,735 --> 00:38:48,303
Sometimes it can--
yes.

732
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:57,446
Me, you, and Harrison...

733
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,015
We're gonna move
to Argentina.

734
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:02,084
We'll make it work, Dex.

735
00:39:02,118 --> 00:39:04,253
I can give my notice
at Miami Metro,

736
00:39:04,287 --> 00:39:06,288
say I'm burnt out.

737
00:39:06,322 --> 00:39:09,558
I'm taking Harrison
to travel for a while.

738
00:39:13,663 --> 00:39:16,465
Only Debra
will know the truth.

739
00:39:25,174 --> 00:39:27,709
Lieutenant.

740
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,611
Have you heard anything
on the whereabouts

741
00:39:29,646 --> 00:39:30,913
of Zach Hamilton?

742
00:39:30,947 --> 00:39:32,714
Zach Hamilton?

743
00:39:32,749 --> 00:39:35,651
You made it pretty clear
that we back away from him.

744
00:39:35,685 --> 00:39:36,952
I just got a call
from his parents.

745
00:39:36,986 --> 00:39:39,821
They haven't heard from him
in days.

746
00:39:39,856 --> 00:39:41,990
Did they file
a missing persons report?

747
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:44,326
They just did.

748
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,829
Look...in case he does
turn up,

749
00:39:47,864 --> 00:39:49,831
I want to be
the first to know.

750
00:39:49,866 --> 00:39:51,500
I'll make sure of it.

751
00:39:58,107 --> 00:39:59,575
Deb, thanks for coming in.

752
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:01,243
Yeah. What's up?

753
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:13,589
Welcome back
to homicide, Detective.

754
00:40:17,226 --> 00:40:18,961
You'll earn your way back up.

755
00:40:21,064 --> 00:40:23,699
You don't know how happy
this makes me feel.

756
00:40:23,733 --> 00:40:26,301
It's like the family
coming together again.

757
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:28,704
We gotta celebrate.

758
00:40:28,738 --> 00:40:30,572
Yeah.

759
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,745
What?

760
00:40:36,779 --> 00:40:39,681
It's all happening so fast.

761
00:40:39,716 --> 00:40:40,916
And?

762
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,651
Would you rather
it happened slow?

763
00:40:42,685 --> 00:40:44,886
I just...

764
00:40:44,921 --> 00:40:47,356
need some time...
to think about it.

765
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,024
What's there
to think about?

766
00:40:49,058 --> 00:40:50,125
Thought this
is what you wanted?

767
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:52,794
It is.

768
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:56,531
I mean, I thought it was.

769
00:40:56,566 --> 00:40:59,368
I don't get it.

770
00:40:59,402 --> 00:41:04,373
I just need a little time,
you know.

771
00:41:04,407 --> 00:41:07,309
Take all the time
you need.

772
00:41:12,315 --> 00:41:15,651
Hey...

773
00:41:15,685 --> 00:41:17,419
Hold on to this.

774
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:39,808
Hey.

775
00:41:39,842 --> 00:41:42,077
Hey.

776
00:41:42,111 --> 00:41:45,247
I, uh, tried
getting in touch with Saxon,

777
00:41:45,281 --> 00:41:47,182
but, uh, he's not
answering his phone.

778
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:50,152
And, uh, went by his place.
He cleared out.

779
00:41:50,186 --> 00:41:51,920
Shit.

780
00:41:51,954 --> 00:41:53,655
Yeah.

781
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,724
At least we're on
the right track.

782
00:41:55,758 --> 00:41:57,693
Yeah.

783
00:41:57,727 --> 00:41:59,695
Good luck with that.

784
00:42:01,197 --> 00:42:03,265
Deb...

785
00:42:03,299 --> 00:42:07,436
I, uh, wouldn't have
gotten this far without you.

786
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,705
I'm glad I could help.

787
00:42:24,454 --> 00:42:26,321
You cleaned.

788
00:42:26,355 --> 00:42:27,756
A little.

789
00:42:31,928 --> 00:42:35,230
Well, I hope I can
still find shit.

790
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:37,165
I used to know
where everything was.

791
00:42:41,704 --> 00:42:43,138
Hungry?

792
00:42:43,172 --> 00:42:46,508
Are you kidding?

793
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:48,944
Totally fair.

794
00:42:48,978 --> 00:42:50,512
Well, I am gonna eat,

795
00:42:50,546 --> 00:42:52,514
and I made enough
for you too.

796
00:42:55,852 --> 00:42:57,319
You going back?

797
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:04,159
How the fuck
can I go back?

798
00:43:05,561 --> 00:43:08,430
My brother's
a serial killer.

799
00:43:08,464 --> 00:43:11,032
And I have another one
hiding out in my house,

800
00:43:11,067 --> 00:43:13,468
eating salad.

801
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:15,170
Sorry.

802
00:43:20,243 --> 00:43:22,511
It was stupid to think
that I could go back.

803
00:43:31,087 --> 00:43:32,988
Well, I know a lot
about wanting things

804
00:43:33,022 --> 00:43:34,723
that you can't have.

805
00:43:34,757 --> 00:43:36,558
I wish,
somewhere along the line,

806
00:43:36,592 --> 00:43:38,560
I'd learned to take no
for an answer.

807
00:43:38,594 --> 00:43:41,530
Would have made my life
a lot easier.

808
00:43:41,564 --> 00:43:43,298
But you didn't?

809
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:46,001
I'll take that one.

810
00:43:46,035 --> 00:43:47,602
Fine.

811
00:43:49,605 --> 00:43:51,239
Well, it's just who I am.

812
00:43:51,274 --> 00:43:52,574
And, uh...

813
00:43:52,608 --> 00:43:54,075
something tells me
that you might

814
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:56,077
be kind of the same way.

815
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:01,183
Maybe that's the one thing
we have in common.

816
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:18,066
I can't believe
I'm eating food you made.

817
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,202
It's not bad, though, right?

818
00:44:20,236 --> 00:44:22,003
No.

819
00:44:26,943 --> 00:44:28,743
Mm.

820
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,447
All right, two-minute warning,
Harrison.

821
00:44:32,481 --> 00:44:33,849
Swim lessons are calling.

822
00:44:33,883 --> 00:44:35,283
Almost done.

823
00:44:38,054 --> 00:44:41,756
Sorry about this police
protection business.

824
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:44,059
No, it's good.

825
00:44:44,093 --> 00:44:46,194
I'm actually glad
that they're here.

826
00:44:46,229 --> 00:44:47,696
I mean, if Hannah
were to stop by,

827
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:50,298
poor Harrison would
probably run right to her.

828
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,633
He's not the only one.

829
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:56,805
Dexter,
hope I'm not intruding.

830
00:44:56,839 --> 00:44:58,540
No, not at all.

831
00:44:58,574 --> 00:44:59,641
Come in.

832
00:44:59,675 --> 00:45:02,277
All right.

833
00:45:02,311 --> 00:45:03,645
What can I do for you?

834
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:06,648
Just checking in and making
sure everything's okay.

835
00:45:06,682 --> 00:45:07,649
Yeah, everything's fine.

836
00:45:07,683 --> 00:45:09,150
Well, good to hear.

837
00:45:09,185 --> 00:45:11,653
I'm thinking
the Hannah McKay threat

838
00:45:11,687 --> 00:45:13,421
has pretty much died down.

839
00:45:13,456 --> 00:45:14,723
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I mean,

840
00:45:14,757 --> 00:45:16,658
if she was here,
I'm pretty sure she's gone.

841
00:45:16,692 --> 00:45:21,296
So I'm gonna recommend we pull
off your protective detail.

842
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:22,664
Okay.

843
00:45:22,698 --> 00:45:25,467
All right.

844
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:26,935
And what's your name?

845
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:30,805
- Harrison.
- Harrison.

846
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,074
Wow.
Is this your family?

847
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:34,910
Mmhmm.

848
00:45:35,978 --> 00:45:37,812
Is this your daddy?

849
00:45:37,847 --> 00:45:39,648
That's you, right?

850
00:45:39,682 --> 00:45:41,116
Mmhmm.

851
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,918
Now, who's the pretty lady?

852
00:45:48,024 --> 00:45:49,391
That's my mom.

853
00:45:49,425 --> 00:45:50,659
Your mom?

854
00:45:50,693 --> 00:45:53,028
Hey, why don't you go
grab your towel, bud?

855
00:45:53,062 --> 00:45:54,996
Swing time.

856
00:45:55,031 --> 00:45:57,132
Come on, let's go,
little shark man.

857
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:04,205
He lost his mother
when he was just a baby.

858
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,474
I think drawing her helps him
feel closer to her.

859
00:46:06,509 --> 00:46:08,610
Sure.

860
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:12,714
Well, we really do
need to get going, uh...

861
00:46:12,748 --> 00:46:14,149
Thanks for checking in.

862
00:46:14,183 --> 00:46:15,951
All right, take care.

863
00:46:23,392 --> 00:46:24,826
Hey, you got a sec?

864
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,328
Sure.

865
00:46:30,366 --> 00:46:33,702
Closing the door.
That's never a good sign.

866
00:46:33,736 --> 00:46:37,172
So Hannah McKay
dated your brother, huh?

867
00:46:37,206 --> 00:46:39,741
You didn't think to mention
that to me at all?

868
00:46:39,775 --> 00:46:40,842
Thought never
crossed your mind?

869
00:46:40,876 --> 00:46:43,511
I didn't think
it was important.

870
00:46:43,546 --> 00:46:45,313
What else are you not
telling me?

871
00:46:45,348 --> 00:46:47,849
I don't know,
but if I told you--

872
00:46:47,883 --> 00:46:49,351
Drop the bullshit, Morgan.

873
00:46:49,385 --> 00:46:51,086
What happened in the Keys?

874
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,022
You see her?

875
00:46:54,056 --> 00:46:55,924
No.

876
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:57,192
I don't believe you.

877
00:46:57,226 --> 00:46:58,426
'Cause you either saw her,

878
00:46:58,461 --> 00:46:59,894
or your brother told you
to lay off--

879
00:46:59,929 --> 00:47:01,363
Well, what if he did?
What does it even matter?

880
00:47:01,397 --> 00:47:03,231
Oh, I'll give you
250,000 reasons why.

881
00:47:03,265 --> 00:47:05,000
But, clearly, you and I
have different priorities.

882
00:47:05,034 --> 00:47:06,768
My brother?
Yeah. We do.

883
00:47:06,802 --> 00:47:08,169
You know, after all the things
that I've done for you,

884
00:47:08,204 --> 00:47:09,771
I find it hard to believe
that you could do this.

885
00:47:09,805 --> 00:47:10,772
I really do.

886
00:47:10,806 --> 00:47:12,374
And maybe you need
to ask yourself

887
00:47:12,408 --> 00:47:14,542
if this is the right job
for you.

888
00:47:14,577 --> 00:47:17,512
And if not, why don't you
get the fuck out?

889
00:47:17,546 --> 00:47:18,947
'Cause I could
use the office space

890
00:47:18,981 --> 00:47:20,782
for somebody
that gives a shit.

891
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:30,792
Oh, Dexter.

892
00:47:30,826 --> 00:47:34,462
Sorry, I...
know I'm early.

893
00:47:34,497 --> 00:47:36,765
I'd make you some coffee,
but I only have tea.

894
00:47:36,799 --> 00:47:38,400
That'll do.

895
00:47:46,842 --> 00:47:49,878
I warn you, it's strong.

896
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:51,980
I need all the help
I can get this morning.

897
00:47:52,014 --> 00:47:53,715
Thanks.

898
00:47:56,485 --> 00:47:58,086
Just so we're clear,

899
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,621
I'm meeting up with Daniel,

900
00:47:59,655 --> 00:48:01,823
and I'll lead him
out of the cafe,

901
00:48:01,857 --> 00:48:03,558
where you will sedate him.

902
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:06,895
And--and we'll take him
to a facility.

903
00:48:19,575 --> 00:48:21,042
Every time
I close my eyes,

904
00:48:21,077 --> 00:48:25,046
I-I still see his face.

905
00:48:25,081 --> 00:48:26,915
- Daniel.
- Yes.

906
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:29,017
Now to learn
that he's alive

907
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:31,086
is just too good
to accept.

908
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,089
It is hard to believe.

909
00:48:34,123 --> 00:48:36,791
But another part of me
knows it's true.

910
00:48:37,893 --> 00:48:40,095
And I'm going to see him.

911
00:48:43,065 --> 00:48:46,267
My son.

912
00:48:46,302 --> 00:48:47,902
My little boy.

913
00:48:51,107 --> 00:48:53,641
He still exists.

914
00:48:53,676 --> 00:48:55,510
No--no matter
what he's done.

915
00:48:55,544 --> 00:48:57,645
Uhh!

916
00:49:00,182 --> 00:49:01,883
I thought
one of Hannah's potions

917
00:49:01,917 --> 00:49:04,252
would be gentler
than my needle.

918
00:49:04,286 --> 00:49:06,287
Now Vogel will never
have to face

919
00:49:06,322 --> 00:49:07,922
what her son has become.

920
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,174
Can I get a cup
of coffee please?

921
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:27,809
I'll bring that
right over.

922
00:49:38,821 --> 00:49:40,655
Here you go.

923
00:49:51,267 --> 00:49:53,668
? nobody can tell ya ?

924
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:54,736
Hey, Lucy.

925
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,137
Hi.

926
00:49:56,172 --> 00:49:58,673
? There's only one song
worth singin' ?

927
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:15,156
? nobody can tell ya ?

928
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:22,897
He's played that song
three times.

929
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:25,867
When is he gonna give up?

930
00:50:42,384 --> 00:50:46,521
I'll follow him until I find
a quiet place to grab him.

931
00:50:46,555 --> 00:50:48,022
For Vogel's own good,

932
00:50:48,057 --> 00:50:50,024
it's time I killed
the messenger.

933
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:53,621
Saxon must have
spotted you.

934
00:51:53,656 --> 00:51:55,323
He's good at this.

935
00:51:55,357 --> 00:51:58,726
He might think Vogel
sent you, Dexter.

936
00:51:58,761 --> 00:52:02,664
He could going to her house
right now.

937
00:52:04,733 --> 00:52:06,467
You've reached
Dr. Evelyn Vogel.

938
00:52:06,502 --> 00:52:08,069
I'm not available
at this time.

939
00:52:08,103 --> 00:52:10,171
Please leave a message.

940
00:52:10,205 --> 00:52:12,240
Evelyn!

941
00:52:21,717 --> 00:52:23,084
You drugged me.

942
00:52:23,118 --> 00:52:24,452
You have every right
to be upset,

943
00:52:24,486 --> 00:52:26,187
but I was only trying
to protect you.

944
00:52:26,221 --> 00:52:27,322
Where's Daniel?

945
00:52:28,957 --> 00:52:30,291
He got away.
That's why I'm here.

946
00:52:30,326 --> 00:52:31,292
To warn you.

947
00:52:31,327 --> 00:52:33,461
Well, I consider myself
warned.

948
00:52:33,495 --> 00:52:35,330
And I think it best
from here on out

949
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:36,798
that I handle this myself.

950
00:52:36,832 --> 00:52:39,267
It's not safe.
Or smart.

951
00:52:39,301 --> 00:52:41,002
I appreciate your concern,

952
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:43,304
and I'm grateful
for everything you've done.

953
00:52:43,339 --> 00:52:46,107
But this
is a family matter.

954
00:52:47,976 --> 00:52:51,279
You once called yourself
my spiritual mother.

955
00:52:51,313 --> 00:52:53,848
Doesn't that
make us family?

956
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:57,085
Well, after what happened
this morning, Dexter,

957
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,454
how can I trust you?

958
00:53:03,492 --> 00:53:04,959
Well, trust me or not,

959
00:53:04,993 --> 00:53:06,928
I'm going to take care
of Daniel.

960
00:53:06,962 --> 00:53:09,530
Your safety and mine
depend on it.

961
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:12,166
And after that,
I'm on my way with Hannah.

962
00:53:12,201 --> 00:53:14,602
- On your way?
- I'm leaving Miami with her.

963
00:53:14,636 --> 00:53:16,471
We're going away together
with Harrison.

964
00:53:16,505 --> 00:53:17,772
You know that won't
end well.

965
00:53:17,806 --> 00:53:19,240
And you trusting Daniel,

966
00:53:19,274 --> 00:53:22,076
that he's not gonna
hurt anyone again--

967
00:53:22,111 --> 00:53:23,811
how will that end?

968
00:53:25,381 --> 00:53:27,448
Leave this alone, Dexter.

969
00:53:40,229 --> 00:53:41,829
Vogel thinks I'm unique,

970
00:53:41,864 --> 00:53:43,731
caught between two worlds--

971
00:53:43,766 --> 00:53:46,567
my humanity
and my darkness.

972
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:48,903
Maybe I always will be,
but I can't imagine

973
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:52,006
a life without Hannah
in either one.

974
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,041
After this morning,
I won't have to.

975
00:53:54,076 --> 00:53:57,879
Vogel is on her own,
and so am I.

976
00:53:57,913 --> 00:54:01,749
I'll kill Saxon
and leave Miami forever.

977
00:54:04,153 --> 00:54:06,821
So now do you believe me?

978
00:54:06,855 --> 00:54:08,423
Yes.

979
00:54:08,457 --> 00:54:10,725
You didn't send him.

980
00:54:12,795 --> 00:54:14,595
Are you hungry?

981
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:16,864
How about
a little breakfast?

982
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:23,871
Okay.

983
00:54:27,476 --> 00:54:29,577
Mom.

984
