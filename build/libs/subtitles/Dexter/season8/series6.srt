00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:56,313
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:57,668
Who's the guy that
dropped you off this morning?

4
00:01:57,744 --> 00:01:58,947
We didn't sleep together,

5
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:00,071
if that's what you're
getting at.

6
00:02:00,105 --> 00:02:02,007
You are certainly allowed
to be a player.

7
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,099
You remember Cassie, right?

8
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,947
- Yeah, new neighbor. Hi.
- Hi.

9
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:08,151
I kind of need to leave.

10
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:10,116
Go. I'll take care of Jamie.
We'll be fine.

11
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:11,285
Maybe we could reschedule?

12
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,279
Yeah.
I'd like that.

13
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,594
Any reason why you haven't
taken the sergeant's exam?

14
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:17,230
I got your brother on my ass

15
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:18,731
about taking
the sergeant's test--

16
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:20,901
And what is so wrong
about trying to better yourself?

17
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:22,136
You nailed it, bro.

18
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,370
Is he your choice for sergeant?

19
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:25,307
I'm ready to take on
more responsibility.

20
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:28,110
I want you to strongly
consider making her sergeant.

21
00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:29,778
I think you may be my father.

22
00:02:29,812 --> 00:02:32,148
Family showing up like that
out of nowhere?

23
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:33,583
A lot of times,
they just want something.

24
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:35,953
I want to hire you to do
a background check on someone.

25
00:02:35,987 --> 00:02:37,454
You really think
she's here to rip you off?

26
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:39,491
I don't know what to think.

27
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:41,126
Norma Rivera.

28
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,228
She'd been having an affair
with the boss, Ed Hamilton.

29
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:45,865
- Dad, what's going on?
- The Hamilton son.

30
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,800
Did you go to the place
where Norma Rivera was killed?

31
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,069
I did.

32
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,571
What did you see in your,
you know, analysis?

33
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:53,240
- Leave the kid alone.
- He killed her.

34
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:55,643
You don't know that.
Your only witness recanted.

35
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,879
No reason to make enemies
unless we really have to.

36
00:02:57,913 --> 00:02:59,081
Where's Yates?

37
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,084
So this is finally over.

38
00:03:02,118 --> 00:03:03,219
My tormenter's dead.

39
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:04,554
Thanks to you, Dexter.

40
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:05,822
And Deb.

41
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,956
I'm glad to see
that you two have managed

42
00:03:06,991 --> 00:03:08,526
to find your way
back to each other.

43
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,561
Well, the family
that kills together...

44
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:12,497
A few days ago,
everything seemed hopeless

45
00:03:12,532 --> 00:03:13,732
between Deb and me.

46
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:16,034
But through Dr. Vogel,
I've got my sister back.

47
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:17,904
It's beautiful out here,
Dexter.

48
00:03:17,938 --> 00:03:21,507
I wanted to be with family.

49
00:03:35,826 --> 00:03:36,960
Accidents happen,

50
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:39,462
shattering our sense
of control,

51
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:42,833
if not our lives.

52
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,439
It's no accident
that Zach Hamilton is here.

53
00:03:47,473 --> 00:03:49,675
He's drawn to blood, like me.

54
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:54,682
Did he kill Norma Rivera?

55
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:07,230
After a week of vetting him,

56
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:09,533
I haven't been able
to find definitive proof.

57
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:17,342
But I'm sure,
if I keep following him,

58
00:04:17,376 --> 00:04:19,812
the truth will become clear.

59
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:39,602
Or it could get murkier.

60
00:05:12,943 --> 00:05:14,211
Dexter.

61
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:15,980
Have you taken on Zach Hamilton

62
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:16,981
as a patient?

63
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:18,215
It's nice to see you, too.

64
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,951
I have to protect you
from another murderer now?

65
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,320
How did he even get to you?

66
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,455
His father contacted me

67
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,493
because of my reputation
for working with psychopaths.

68
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,430
He's concerned
about his son's behavior,

69
00:05:29,464 --> 00:05:31,865
his propensity for violence.

70
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,301
I think it's more
than a propensity.

71
00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:37,707
I think Zach Hamilton
killed Norma Rivera.

72
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:40,910
And I take it that
you followed him here today

73
00:05:40,944 --> 00:05:42,879
because you're planning
to kill him?

74
00:05:42,914 --> 00:05:44,681
The thought had
crossed my mind, yes,

75
00:05:44,716 --> 00:05:46,550
if I can find solid proof.

76
00:05:46,584 --> 00:05:47,585
Well, then it would seem

77
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:52,491
that we have a conflict
of interest.

78
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:55,461
I don't believe this.

79
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:56,763
You're going to work
with another killer

80
00:05:56,797 --> 00:05:59,299
after what happened with Yates?

81
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,635
Dexter,
I appreciate your concern,

82
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,070
but I'm not going to talk

83
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:06,675
about Zach Hamilton
with you any further.

84
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:08,276
It wouldn't be ethical.

85
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:10,613
Suddenly,
you're worried about ethics?

86
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:11,781
I know.

87
00:06:11,815 --> 00:06:13,182
I threw them out the window
when I met you

88
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:15,853
because my life
was on the line.

89
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:17,688
Now the threat is over.

90
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:20,091
And you're bringing
another threat into your life.

91
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:24,129
It's my work.
What can I say?

92
00:06:24,163 --> 00:06:26,465
I treat dangerous people.

93
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,300
It's a hazard of the job.

94
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:29,603
Besides, you have no proof

95
00:06:29,637 --> 00:06:32,105
that Zach Hamilton
is guilty of anything.

96
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,941
I will.

97
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,110
If you do,

98
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,514
then come to see me first

99
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:40,315
before you do anything,

100
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,553
and we'll have
another conversation.

101
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:46,623
Would you do me that favor?

102
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:49,660
We'll see.

103
00:07:00,574 --> 00:07:02,136
I mean, this is
why she tracked me down,

104
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,110
to hit me up for money.

105
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:05,279
You don't know that.

106
00:07:05,313 --> 00:07:07,816
I mean, maybe she genuinely
wanted to get to know you.

107
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,752
Well, at the same time
her Hyundai's being repossessed?

108
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:12,121
Has she asked you for money?

109
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:14,990
No, but she always seems
to be missing her purse

110
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:18,128
when the check comes.

111
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:22,767
I thought we had
a real connection.

112
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:25,971
You like having Niki
in your life?

113
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:27,306
Yeah, I do.

114
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,307
Then why don't you
just wait it out

115
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:30,577
and see how it plays out?

116
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:33,580
In the meantime,
you can enjoy her company.

117
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:39,420
Okay.

118
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:46,062
Thanks, Deb.

119
00:07:46,096 --> 00:07:48,831
Welcome.

120
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:53,838
Deb, got a new case.

121
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,073
Let me guess, someone suspects

122
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:58,310
their significant other
is fucking around on them.

123
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:01,413
Yeah...but this one
is a bit different.

124
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,414
How?

125
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,985
Because the person is me,

126
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:06,620
and the significant other,

127
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:09,223
my sister's ass-chasing,
shithead boyfriend.

128
00:08:09,258 --> 00:08:11,259
Kevin Wyman, notorious player,

129
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:12,561
frequents a singles bar

130
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:14,329
in a hotel where he keeps
a hotel suite.

131
00:08:14,364 --> 00:08:17,033
Have you tried
talking to her about this?

132
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,468
Susan doesn't listen to me.

133
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:21,070
It'd just push her
more quickly into his arms.

134
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:22,506
So that's off the table.

135
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,910
Well, going behind her back
seems kind of fucked up.

136
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:26,945
It's got to be done this way.

137
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:27,946
I gotta catch this guy
in the act.

138
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,147
I gotta present her
with the facts.

139
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:30,742
Okay, but you're doing it
by yourself.

140
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,851
I need your help on this, Deb.

141
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:33,653
It'd be a lot less conspicuous

142
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,555
if we work this as a couple.

143
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,925
Well, I'm not sure
if I'm comfortable.

144
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:42,530
Well, are you comfortable
getting a paycheck?

145
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,969
Okay, boss.

146
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:49,505
Thank you.

147
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:55,313
Where does this piece go?

148
00:08:55,347 --> 00:08:57,648
Right here.

149
00:08:57,683 --> 00:08:59,518
Very good.

150
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:01,853
Dex, don't forget,

151
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:03,555
my birthday picnic's
in a few days, okay?

152
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,525
On the beach,
outside of Papa's.

153
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,559
Bring Harrison.

154
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:08,629
- Yeah, we'll be there.
- Great.

155
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:10,230
You know who else
will be there?

156
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:11,699
Cassie.

157
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:12,933
I heard you have a date
with her today.

158
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:14,569
No, it's not a date.

159
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:15,971
I just felt like I owed her one

160
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:18,374
after we both bailed
on your dinner the other night.

161
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:20,042
Oh, my God,
why won't you just admit

162
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:22,913
that you like her and that
I am an awesome matchmaker?

163
00:09:22,947 --> 00:09:25,115
I'll admit that
you're an awesome nanny.

164
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,717
You'll have to settle for that.

165
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:30,188
We'll revisit this
after the date.

166
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:31,556
Oh, by the way,

167
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,727
the TV remote has
been missing since yesterday.

168
00:09:34,761 --> 00:09:36,963
I think somebody hid it,

169
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:40,367
but I can't get anything
out of him.

170
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:42,503
Harrison,
did you take the TV remote?

171
00:09:42,537 --> 00:09:44,071
No.

172
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:47,175
- Do you know where it is?
- No.

173
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,310
He says he didn't take it.

174
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:49,911
Right.

175
00:09:49,946 --> 00:09:52,382
Guess I'll just
keep looking for it.

176
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,555
Homicide in Liberty City.

177
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,923
All right, Harrison,
it looks like

178
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,493
you're going to have to finish
that puzzle on your own.

179
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:04,796
I'm doing all the work anyway.

180
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,066
Yeah, you are.

181
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,235
- Bye.
- Bye.

182
00:10:18,414 --> 00:10:20,149
Welcome
to spatter-land.

183
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:21,450
Hope you brought extra string.

184
00:10:21,484 --> 00:10:24,754
Never leave home without it.

185
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:26,022
Good news.

186
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:28,793
We have the victim's boyfriend
in custody.

187
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:31,462
A witness saw him
taking off from the scene,

188
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:33,665
and he forgot
to change his bloody socks.

189
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,768
God bless stupid killers.

190
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:52,521
Once again, drawn to blood.

191
00:10:52,556 --> 00:10:55,224
Looks like Zach has just
given me the in I need.

192
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,619
Zach Hamilton, right?

193
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:20,155
You were at my house.

194
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:22,124
That's right.

195
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:25,261
You guys find out
who killed Norma?

196
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:29,500
No luck.
It's a dead end.

197
00:11:29,534 --> 00:11:32,302
So you like
to shoot crime scenes?

198
00:11:32,337 --> 00:11:35,073
Yeah, I got a police scanner
app on my phone.

199
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:36,074
It's better
than sitting at home,

200
00:11:36,108 --> 00:11:37,442
playing video games.

201
00:11:37,476 --> 00:11:39,044
You ever been on the other
side of the yellow tape?

202
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:42,148
Nope.

203
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:43,950
This is as close
as I've gotten.

204
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:47,854
Well, come on.

205
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:48,923
Are you serious?

206
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:51,759
Yeah,
just don't touch anything.

207
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:02,706
Whoa.

208
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:05,509
This is amazing.

209
00:12:05,544 --> 00:12:08,446
I remember that feeling.
Awe, wonder.

210
00:12:08,481 --> 00:12:10,048
It only fed the urge.

211
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:14,053
Hey, can I take some pictures?

212
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:16,122
It's usually against protocol,

213
00:12:16,157 --> 00:12:18,392
but what the hell?

214
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:19,593
Go ahead.

215
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:23,765
Cool. Thanks.

216
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:27,336
So what happened to her?

217
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,104
She was stabbed.

218
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,541
Yeah, obviously.
But, like, you know, how?

219
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:33,510
If I open up to him,

220
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,912
maybe he'll open up to me.

221
00:12:34,947 --> 00:12:40,352
Come on.
I can handle it.

222
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:42,821
Well, the victim
tried to defend herself.

223
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:44,958
There were defensive wounds
on her body,

224
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:47,260
but you can also tell
by these big, round drops

225
00:12:47,294 --> 00:12:51,065
on the ground.

226
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:54,603
And this multiple
cast-off spatter

227
00:12:54,637 --> 00:12:57,505
suggests that she was stabbed
several times.

228
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,443
And the arterial spurting here

229
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:03,881
indicates that the killer
severed her carotid artery

230
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:07,718
with the first stab.

231
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,022
You can tell all that
just by looking at the blood?

232
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,958
Pretty much.

233
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:16,929
Awesome.

234
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,199
So I heard you caught
the guy who did it.

235
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:21,067
- Yeah, her boyfriend.
- How?

236
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:22,069
He was sloppy.

237
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:24,572
Left a bloody print and DNA.

238
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:26,608
Plus, he was spotted
driving away from the scene.

239
00:13:26,643 --> 00:13:28,477
Oh, yeah?
What kind of car?

240
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:30,031
He must have heard
his Porsche was seen

241
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:31,381
at Norma's apartment.

242
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:34,384
No one noticed.

243
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:40,491
So the killer,
he--

244
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:43,428
he should've worn gloves
and long sleeves,

245
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:44,596
made sure he was covered up.

246
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,034
He's making this
a teaching moment.

247
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:51,939
Well, yeah, if he was smart.

248
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:53,340
The kid's a quick study,

249
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:57,045
but that doesn't prove
he killed Norma Rivera.

250
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,013
Uh, so, hey,
I-I gotta get going,

251
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:02,651
but thanks.

252
00:14:02,686 --> 00:14:04,387
Hey, why don't you
give me a call

253
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:05,789
when you print those up?

254
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,759
I'd love to take a look.

255
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:13,765
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess I could do that.

256
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:19,539
Time to make
another connection.

257
00:14:24,746 --> 00:14:27,849
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

258
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:29,884
Thank you for doing this
with me.

259
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,353
When you own a food truck,

260
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:33,622
you kinda have to scope out
the competition constantly.

261
00:14:33,657 --> 00:14:35,257
Plus I just really love to eat.

262
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,692
Yeah, no problem.

263
00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:38,929
I wouldn't miss these
peanut butter and Nutella fries

264
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:40,864
- for anything.
- Mm-hmm.

265
00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:48,741
So you're indulging me
in my favorite pastime.

266
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:50,509
What do you like to do for fun?

267
00:14:50,543 --> 00:14:53,613
You know, normal stuff.

268
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:56,217
Like what?

269
00:14:56,251 --> 00:14:59,820
Um...

270
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:01,256
I like spending time
with my son.

271
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,258
Mm, I already know
you're a great dad.

272
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:05,461
What else?

273
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:07,397
I love my job.

274
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:11,568
But that's work.
What are you passionate about?

275
00:15:13,304 --> 00:15:15,140
I like to bowl.

276
00:15:15,174 --> 00:15:18,810
You're passionate
about bowling?

277
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:20,679
No.

278
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:21,947
Of course not.

279
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:25,585
I, uh, just do it for fun,
once in a while.

280
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,689
Uh, what about your weekends

281
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:31,893
or your free time?

282
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:33,796
Oh, I have a boat.

283
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,230
Oh, I love to sail.

284
00:15:35,265 --> 00:15:37,834
No, it's a motorboat.

285
00:15:37,868 --> 00:15:40,136
Oh.
You water-ski?

286
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:41,805
No.

287
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,309
- Race?
- No.

288
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:46,464
Do you scuba dive?

289
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,413
No.

290
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,151
What do you do on your boat?

291
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:54,587
I just...

292
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,559
take it out and...

293
00:15:58,593 --> 00:16:01,696
turn around and come back.

294
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,264
That's it?

295
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:05,667
That's all I can tell you.

296
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:08,971
I think we may need
some alcohol.

297
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:12,042
Right.

298
00:16:12,076 --> 00:16:15,145
Dating is harder
than I remember.

299
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,055
Oh, this guy
is fucking pathetic.

300
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:24,690
I get that you hate the guy,

301
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:25,692
but looking isn't cheating.

302
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:26,693
It's a slow night.

303
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:29,530
Give him a minute.

304
00:16:29,564 --> 00:16:32,399
So you said Susan
doesn't listen.

305
00:16:32,434 --> 00:16:35,036
Does that mean you all
have a strained relationship?

306
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,671
Not from my end, no.

307
00:16:36,706 --> 00:16:40,276
But from hers?

308
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,044
Yeah, you know, probably.

309
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,716
I mean, look, I couldn't wait
to get away from my old man,

310
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,518
and unfortunately,
Susan was just a kid.

311
00:16:47,552 --> 00:16:52,423
You know, I should have
at least picked up the phone.

312
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:57,263
But I never did,
you know, so...

313
00:16:57,297 --> 00:17:01,134
Well, you can't undo the past.

314
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:04,338
And families fuck you up.
That's just the way it is.

315
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:07,776
Well, I can stop Susan
from fucking up her future.

316
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:12,015
I can do that.

317
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:14,717
It looks like he's
packing it in for the night.

318
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:16,387
Elway, if you wanna
catch this guy cheating,

319
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:18,489
why don't I set him up
and see if he takes the bait?

320
00:17:18,523 --> 00:17:20,558
No, I don't want you
doing that.

321
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:21,626
I worked Vice.

322
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:25,630
I've done worse
than that before.

323
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,186
I just need to get
a couple of pictures

324
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:28,334
of him hitting on you.

325
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:29,769
Certainly nothing more
than that.

326
00:17:29,803 --> 00:17:31,238
Are you sure?

327
00:17:31,272 --> 00:17:32,606
I mean, I could marry him,

328
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,144
maybe pop out
a couple of babies.

329
00:17:36,178 --> 00:17:39,815
Let's go.

330
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:55,801
Dexter, thanks for coming.

331
00:17:55,835 --> 00:17:57,302
Sure.

332
00:17:57,337 --> 00:17:58,805
Couldn't wait to show you
these photos.

333
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:01,007
Yeah, no problem.
It's on my way to work.

334
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,408
Donut?

335
00:18:02,443 --> 00:18:04,345
Fuckin' A.

336
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:09,217
Mmm.

337
00:18:09,252 --> 00:18:12,187
Well?

338
00:18:13,857 --> 00:18:17,561
He treats the blood
like a swimsuit model.

339
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:20,297
Well...

340
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:22,267
very colorful.

341
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,622
You know,
a lot of photographers

342
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,970
like to mute down their reds.

343
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,607
You know,
find it too distracting,

344
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:31,344
but I like to ride
the saturation.

345
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:33,913
Hmm.

346
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:36,183
You think I overdid it?

347
00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:38,719
No way.
These are you.

348
00:18:38,754 --> 00:18:40,554
That's the important thing.

349
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:43,525
Well, I can work you up
some prints, if you want.

350
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,127
I mean, I wouldn't have 'em
if it weren't for you.

351
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:48,464
Actually, I think I have
plenty of my own.

352
00:18:50,468 --> 00:18:51,602
Right.

353
00:18:51,636 --> 00:18:54,638
Of course.
I forget it was a crime scene.

354
00:18:54,673 --> 00:18:56,107
Keep thinking that dead chick

355
00:18:56,142 --> 00:18:59,478
spilled all that blood
just for me.

356
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,388
Who's she?

357
00:19:08,423 --> 00:19:11,359
Uh, it's nothing.

358
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:14,530
Just a lens test.

359
00:19:14,564 --> 00:19:17,232
New 300 millimeter.
Fucking monster.

360
00:19:17,267 --> 00:19:20,670
Wow.

361
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:24,141
Excuse me.
Yep?

362
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:33,986
Jesus, are you still drunk
from last night

363
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:35,488
or are you starting
a new bender?

364
00:19:35,522 --> 00:19:36,823
Yeah, okay.

365
00:19:36,857 --> 00:19:40,794
Yeah, I said okay.

366
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:42,864
Uh, I gotta go.

367
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:44,219
- Anything wrong?
- No, it's fine.

368
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:47,503
I just gotta go.

369
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:50,506
Sure, some other time then.

370
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:55,780
I'll have to find another way
to get to him.

371
00:20:01,454 --> 00:20:03,222
Ah, lieutenant.

372
00:20:03,256 --> 00:20:05,725
Tell me something.

373
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,427
Did you decide
you don't need a sergeant?

374
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:08,561
Sir?

375
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:10,197
I expected to hear
an announcement by now.

376
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:11,866
What's going on?

377
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,868
To tell you the truth,
I'm having trouble

378
00:20:13,902 --> 00:20:16,171
narrowing down my choice.

379
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:23,479
I know you want me
to pick Miller.

380
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,582
And on paper,
I can't argue with that.

381
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:26,917
She scored higher on the test,

382
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:28,519
she's got the experience,
the track record--

383
00:20:28,554 --> 00:20:30,588
She's African-American,
a woman.

384
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:33,959
Here's the thing,
Quinn has his attributes too.

385
00:20:33,994 --> 00:20:36,095
Name one.

386
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:37,329
He's street-smart.

387
00:20:37,364 --> 00:20:40,100
Look, I know
what's going on here.

388
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:41,134
What do you mean?

389
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:42,870
You want me to be the bad guy.

390
00:20:42,905 --> 00:20:45,039
You want me to insist that
you promote Miller over Quinn.

391
00:20:45,073 --> 00:20:47,643
That way you can tell Quinn,
"Hey, sorry, I had no choice."

392
00:20:47,677 --> 00:20:50,145
- I'm not sure that's--
- You're lieutenant now.

393
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,814
It's time to grow
a set of balls.

394
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:55,852
I want to hear something
by the end of the day.

395
00:21:19,648 --> 00:21:22,918
Just like old times, huh?

396
00:21:22,953 --> 00:21:26,056
You, me, steak, beer.

397
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,025
Yeah, it's been a while.

398
00:21:32,898 --> 00:21:34,233
So how are things?

399
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:36,735
Good, great.
You?

400
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:40,406
Fine. Better.

401
00:21:40,441 --> 00:21:43,811
Good. I'm glad.

402
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,881
Me too.

403
00:21:46,915 --> 00:21:49,951
I think these are done.

404
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,496
So how's work?

405
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:01,832
Uh, crazy.

406
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:03,701
Elway wants to catch
his sister's boyfriend

407
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:05,136
fucking around on her,

408
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:09,008
so I offered myself as bait
so he'd get it done.

409
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:11,610
What--you did what?

410
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:13,613
I used to do it
all the time in Vice.

411
00:22:13,648 --> 00:22:15,148
Yeah, and you hated it.

412
00:22:15,182 --> 00:22:17,218
Why would you put yourself
in that position again?

413
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,853
Because he's my boss.

414
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:22,491
And 'cause I can only take
one control freak at a time.

415
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:26,062
Sorry.

416
00:22:32,437 --> 00:22:35,407
This is tough.

417
00:22:36,776 --> 00:22:37,909
A little.

418
00:22:37,944 --> 00:22:40,746
Not exactly worth living for.

419
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:42,882
What?

420
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,417
You said that once,

421
00:22:44,451 --> 00:22:45,732
when you tasted
one of my steaks,

422
00:22:45,753 --> 00:22:47,788
that it was worth living for.

423
00:22:47,822 --> 00:22:51,526
For some reason,
I've always remembered that.

424
00:22:53,495 --> 00:22:55,030
It'll get easier, Dex.

425
00:22:55,065 --> 00:22:57,366
We're just getting
back in the saddle, you know?

426
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,703
Yeah, I think we might
be eating a saddle.

427
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:06,444
Are you still
seeing Dr. Vogel?

428
00:23:06,478 --> 00:23:07,912
Yeah, it's too bad for me

429
00:23:07,946 --> 00:23:09,815
there's no magic pill
to cure PTSD.

430
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:12,484
Well, as long
as she's helping you.

431
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:13,653
I don't get it.

432
00:23:13,687 --> 00:23:14,887
Like, she knows
every fucking thing

433
00:23:14,922 --> 00:23:15,989
about our lives because of dad,

434
00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:17,825
but I don't know
Jack shit about her.

435
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:19,760
Like, where'd she get
that fucking accent?

436
00:23:19,794 --> 00:23:22,697
And who the fuck is rich?

437
00:23:22,732 --> 00:23:25,400
- Her husband.
- She was married?

438
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:27,370
Yeah, when I first
looked into her,

439
00:23:27,404 --> 00:23:29,238
I found out some stuff
about her background,

440
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:32,643
and she was married
to a Dr. Richard Vogel.

441
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,745
Oh.

442
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:37,615
Okay, so Harrison's asleep.

443
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,250
And look what I found
under his bed.

444
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,752
Ooh, someone's in trouble.

445
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,154
He lied about it.

446
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:43,589
At least now we know why.

447
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,491
I hope it's under warranty,

448
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:47,694
or I'll be stuck
with whatever's on PBS kids

449
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:50,163
for the foreseeable future.

450
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:51,465
I'll talk to him.

451
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,967
Okay.
Enjoy your dinner, guys.

452
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:55,370
Bye.

453
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,309
Should I be worried
that Harrison's lying?

454
00:24:00,344 --> 00:24:02,712
He's four, doofus.

455
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:04,782
Right.

456
00:24:04,816 --> 00:24:07,484
This steak tastes like asshole.

457
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:08,686
Yeah.

458
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,388
Let's order pizza.

459
00:24:10,423 --> 00:24:11,956
With pineapple, please.

460
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:15,327
Not on my half.

461
00:24:15,362 --> 00:24:17,496
Sorry, cow.

462
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:39,690
What's up?

463
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:41,759
I'm promoting Miller
to sergeant.

464
00:24:41,794 --> 00:24:44,863
Say that again?

465
00:24:44,897 --> 00:24:47,133
I'm giving Miller the job.
I'm sorry.

466
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:50,203
I just think she's
the most qualified candidate.

467
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:51,739
Are you fucking kidding me?

468
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:53,941
I mean, after all the quizzes,

469
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:56,177
and the speeches
about bettering my life?

470
00:24:56,212 --> 00:24:58,980
You actually made me want this,

471
00:24:59,014 --> 00:25:01,217
and now you're going
to take it away.

472
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,285
Why? 'Cause I didn't solve
the fucking Norma Rivera case?

473
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,754
No, of course not.

474
00:25:04,788 --> 00:25:08,592
It's just a lot of other stuff
I can't ignore, man.

475
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:12,463
The Nadia thing,
shooting Novikov.

476
00:25:12,498 --> 00:25:13,464
You know what?
Fuck it.

477
00:25:13,499 --> 00:25:16,502
You did what you thought
was right.

478
00:25:16,536 --> 00:25:19,204
Leave it at that.

479
00:25:25,113 --> 00:25:26,413
Hey.

480
00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:30,185
I need everything you got
on the Norma Rivera case,

481
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:33,088
anything that points
to Zach Hamilton.

482
00:25:33,122 --> 00:25:35,992
Uh, forensically,
there's not much.

483
00:25:36,026 --> 00:25:38,128
There's nothing, actually.

484
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:41,165
Fuck it.

485
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:42,967
I'll just tail
the little prick 24-7

486
00:25:43,002 --> 00:25:44,135
until I get what I need.

487
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,237
If Quinn's stalking Zach,
how can I?

488
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:48,607
Won't even know I'm there
till I bust him.

489
00:25:48,642 --> 00:25:53,413
You mind if I come along?

490
00:25:53,447 --> 00:25:55,816
You want to come along?

491
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,118
Yeah, things
are kind of slow here.

492
00:25:57,152 --> 00:25:58,352
I'm going a little stir crazy.

493
00:25:58,387 --> 00:26:00,188
Maybe you could use
another set of eyes?

494
00:26:00,222 --> 00:26:03,091
Sure.

495
00:26:22,683 --> 00:26:24,851
I mean,
you think Miller's clean?

496
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:26,286
Come on.

497
00:26:26,321 --> 00:26:28,622
You dig deep enough
on anyone in this department,

498
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:31,960
and you know what you find?

499
00:26:31,994 --> 00:26:33,962
- What?
- The shit.

500
00:26:33,996 --> 00:26:36,432
It's there.
I mean, we all got it.

501
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:39,636
I know you know
what I'm talking about.

502
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,837
Yeah, I can't argue with that.

503
00:26:40,872 --> 00:26:42,339
We've all got the shit.

504
00:26:42,373 --> 00:26:43,875
Yeah.

505
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:44,876
Big difference is,

506
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,210
some people get away
with theirs,

507
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:49,047
and some people don't.

508
00:26:49,082 --> 00:26:51,383
Well, you're a good detective.
It'll work out.

509
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:53,051
Yeah, I'm just worried

510
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:54,520
about how Jamie's
going to take it.

511
00:26:54,555 --> 00:26:55,622
I think she was all excited

512
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,892
about me moving up
in the world,

513
00:26:57,926 --> 00:26:59,760
making something
out of my life.

514
00:26:59,794 --> 00:27:03,832
She'll probably break up
with my ass now.

515
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:05,033
Jesus Christ, I mean,

516
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:07,102
how many pictures
of fucking women in tights

517
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,105
does this pervert need?

518
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:11,807
Apparently, a lot.

519
00:27:11,842 --> 00:27:14,678
How's Deb doing?
I've been worried about her.

520
00:27:14,712 --> 00:27:18,216
She's good.
She's much better.

521
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,985
You guys work out
whatever your issue was?

522
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,388
What do you mean?

523
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:24,623
Well, I mean, you guys
have been connected at the hip

524
00:27:24,658 --> 00:27:25,959
for most of your lives.

525
00:27:25,993 --> 00:27:27,627
All of a sudden,
you're not talking,

526
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:29,362
you don't see each other.

527
00:27:30,464 --> 00:27:32,867
Somebody shit
in somebody's Cheerios.

528
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,869
Yeah.

529
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,638
Just typical
brother and sister stuff.

530
00:27:36,673 --> 00:27:39,508
- It's no big deal.
- Hmm.

531
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:40,743
Something had her fucked up.

532
00:27:40,778 --> 00:27:41,844
I mean, how weird was it

533
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:44,013
that she confessed
to killing LaGuerta?

534
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:46,116
I should have stayed
in my office.

535
00:27:46,151 --> 00:27:49,454
What was that about?

536
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:53,024
That's the woman in the photo

537
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:54,660
that Zach
didn't want me to see.

538
00:27:54,695 --> 00:27:57,063
And he isn't looking
at the class,

539
00:27:57,097 --> 00:28:00,233
he's looking at her.

540
00:28:00,268 --> 00:28:01,568
You know what I'm saying?

541
00:28:01,602 --> 00:28:03,938
Fortunately, Quinn isn't.

542
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,473
People do weird stuff
when they've had

543
00:28:05,507 --> 00:28:07,942
too much to drink and they're
under a lot of stress.

544
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:11,080
We may never know
what that was all about.

545
00:28:11,114 --> 00:28:12,348
All right.
See you guys later, yeah?

546
00:28:12,382 --> 00:28:15,685
- Looks like they're done.
- So is our guy.

547
00:28:22,027 --> 00:28:25,630
Buckle up.

548
00:28:42,352 --> 00:28:43,986
- Hey.
- Hey.

549
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:45,856
Wow.
Okay, uh--

550
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,758
- What?
- You look incredible.

551
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,159
Good job.

552
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:50,461
Well, that's the point.

553
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:51,996
Don't look
so fucking surprised.

554
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:53,297
Well, you didn't leave me
a lot of places

555
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:54,332
to put the transmitter.

556
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:55,734
Are you bitching?

557
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:57,336
'Cause I'm the one
helping you, remember?

558
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:01,508
I just don't want to touch
anything I'm not supposed to.

559
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:02,842
Here.

560
00:29:10,953 --> 00:29:13,890
Thank you.

561
00:29:16,693 --> 00:29:20,030
- Mic?
- There you go.

562
00:29:26,705 --> 00:29:29,642
I'm not looking.
I'm not looking.

563
00:29:29,676 --> 00:29:30,810
- Okay.
- Okay?

564
00:29:30,844 --> 00:29:33,713
- Yep.
- All right.

565
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:39,087
Quickly,
just say something for me.

566
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:40,688
You blush like a little girl.

567
00:29:40,722 --> 00:29:44,460
Okay, just--

568
00:29:44,494 --> 00:29:46,261
just get him alone.
That's all I need.

569
00:29:46,296 --> 00:29:47,263
I'll take it from there, okay?

570
00:29:47,298 --> 00:29:49,966
- Okay.
- Thank you.

571
00:29:52,237 --> 00:29:55,072
I'm really glad we met.

572
00:29:55,107 --> 00:29:58,710
Me too.

573
00:29:58,744 --> 00:30:01,280
You know, I didn't know
if I mentioned it,

574
00:30:01,315 --> 00:30:03,716
but tonight's kind of
a celebration.

575
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,519
- Yeah?
- Mm.

576
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:08,355
Closed a huge deal.

577
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,459
Two blocks downtown,
prime views of the bay.

578
00:30:11,494 --> 00:30:12,460
It's going to rent
through the roof,

579
00:30:12,495 --> 00:30:14,864
and I get a big piece of it.

580
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:16,332
Something tells me you like

581
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:20,637
getting a big piece
of everything.

582
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:22,806
Whenever I can manage.

583
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,510
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

584
00:30:25,544 --> 00:30:27,712
Just wish
I had a present for you.

585
00:30:32,152 --> 00:30:35,054
What do you say
we migrate to my suite?

586
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:37,757
Got a nice little private bar.

587
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:42,696
It's a lot quieter
than this place.

588
00:30:42,731 --> 00:30:46,735
All done here.

589
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:47,970
You're going to love the views.

590
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,373
It's beautiful.

591
00:30:50,407 --> 00:30:55,045
Nice, light music.

592
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:56,046
It'll be real nice.

593
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,949
No, save it for the room.

594
00:30:57,983 --> 00:30:59,317
Oh, what, are you
playing hard to get?

595
00:30:59,351 --> 00:31:00,919
I don't like to kiss in public.

596
00:31:00,953 --> 00:31:02,788
- Ah, you're bashful.
- Mm-hmm, maybe.

597
00:31:04,024 --> 00:31:06,626
Get your fucking hands
off of her!

598
00:31:06,661 --> 00:31:10,130
Jesus, Elway.

599
00:31:10,164 --> 00:31:11,132
The hell is going on?

600
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,600
She's wired, douchebag.

601
00:31:12,634 --> 00:31:14,335
You're done.

602
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:16,071
You fucking son of a bitch.

603
00:31:16,105 --> 00:31:17,306
You know what, you're going
to call Susan tonight.

604
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,701
You're going
to tell her it's over.

605
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:19,675
If you don't,
she's getting an email

606
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:21,878
with a video attachment.
You got it?

607
00:31:21,912 --> 00:31:23,780
You got it?

608
00:31:23,814 --> 00:31:26,317
- Yeah, I got it.
- Good.

609
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:29,320
You're an asshole.

610
00:31:31,591 --> 00:31:35,428
The fuck are you thinking?

611
00:31:35,462 --> 00:31:37,763
I'm sorry, all right?
I-I-I just--

612
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:40,100
seeing him paw
all over you like that,

613
00:31:40,134 --> 00:31:43,070
I don't like that shit.

614
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,706
I'm sorry about your top.

615
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,773
That's okay.
It's all right.

616
00:31:45,808 --> 00:31:48,777
I got it.

617
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,273
Sofia Fuentes,
current place of employment,

618
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:14,541
the Cypress Harbor Yacht Club,

619
00:32:14,576 --> 00:32:17,279
which is owned
by Zach's family.

620
00:32:17,313 --> 00:32:20,715
That's where Zach must have
first laid eyes on her.

621
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,051
If Zach likes to take pictures

622
00:32:22,085 --> 00:32:23,819
of his victims
before he's killed them,

623
00:32:23,854 --> 00:32:27,090
chances are he likes
after photos as well.

624
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,592
If he did kill Norma Rivera,

625
00:32:28,626 --> 00:32:31,329
then he's got the photos
to prove it.

626
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:18,086
Sofia.

627
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,221
Probably his next victim.

628
00:33:20,255 --> 00:33:22,190
Now I just need to find

629
00:33:22,224 --> 00:33:25,427
any photos of Norma Rivera.

630
00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:23,398
Norma Rivera.

631
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:25,567
Taken seconds
after she was killed,

632
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:27,602
the pool of blood
around her head growing

633
00:34:27,637 --> 00:34:30,907
from one image to the next.

634
00:34:34,212 --> 00:34:37,615
Zach Hamilton,
murder weapon in hand.

635
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,151
All the proof I need.

636
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:49,863
You wanted proof.
There it is.

637
00:34:49,897 --> 00:34:53,267
Zach Hamilton
killed Norma Rivera.

638
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:58,240
Yes.
I know.

639
00:34:58,274 --> 00:35:00,742
- You know?
- Mm.

640
00:35:00,777 --> 00:35:04,514
Zach told me
during our first session.

641
00:35:04,548 --> 00:35:06,509
But you didn't tell me
because of your unflinching

642
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:07,585
sense of ethics?

643
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:09,820
Oh, forget ethics.

644
00:35:09,855 --> 00:35:11,296
Why would I help
facilitate the death

645
00:35:11,324 --> 00:35:13,191
of someone I see potential in?

646
00:35:13,226 --> 00:35:14,392
Potential?
He's a killer.

647
00:35:14,427 --> 00:35:16,395
He deserves to die.

648
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:20,367
Isn't that a little intolerant,
coming from you?

649
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:24,806
I don't kill innocent people.

650
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,575
But you might have,

651
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,445
if it hadn't been
for Harry and me.

652
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:32,815
You could even be
on death row right now, huh?

653
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:35,619
- Right.
- But you were spared.

654
00:35:35,653 --> 00:35:40,925
Yeah, I was spared
because of the code.

655
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:43,262
That's an interesting idea.

656
00:35:43,296 --> 00:35:46,632
What do you mean?

657
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:48,935
What if we were
to teach Zach the code?

658
00:35:48,969 --> 00:35:51,437
- You can't be serious.
- Why not?

659
00:35:51,472 --> 00:35:55,142
It never occurred to me
to try again,

660
00:35:55,176 --> 00:35:57,979
because I didn't have Harry.

661
00:35:58,014 --> 00:36:00,448
But now I have you.

662
00:36:00,483 --> 00:36:02,318
Maybe it's time to see

663
00:36:02,352 --> 00:36:04,820
if the experiment will work.

664
00:36:04,855 --> 00:36:07,024
This isn't a science project.

665
00:36:07,058 --> 00:36:10,661
No, but it's a matter
of life and death.

666
00:36:10,695 --> 00:36:13,164
Zach's life is on the line.

667
00:36:13,198 --> 00:36:14,966
What possibly makes you think

668
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,670
Zach could be taught the code?

669
00:36:17,704 --> 00:36:20,339
I told you,
I see something in him.

670
00:36:20,373 --> 00:36:21,541
And it worked with you.

671
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:22,809
Zach and I are nothing alike.

672
00:36:22,843 --> 00:36:24,611
No, of course not.

673
00:36:24,645 --> 00:36:27,181
You are definitely
one of a kind.

674
00:36:27,215 --> 00:36:28,516
He killed an innocent,

675
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,031
and he's getting ready
to do it again.

676
00:36:30,053 --> 00:36:33,388
He needs to die.

677
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:42,266
Harrison.

678
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,102
I never intended to have a son,

679
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:45,604
but now he's the one thing
in my life

680
00:36:45,638 --> 00:36:48,206
that seems most right.

681
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,843
There she is!

682
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:53,245
Hi!

683
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,816
Yay.
Aww, mwah.

684
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,918
- Happy Birthday.
- Aw, thanks, Dex.

685
00:36:57,952 --> 00:36:59,287
Thank you.

686
00:36:59,321 --> 00:37:01,556
Can I go play?

687
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:05,327
Yeah, sure.
Have fun.

688
00:37:05,362 --> 00:37:07,430
Stay close, Harrison.

689
00:37:13,038 --> 00:37:14,538
Yeah, I'm, um--

690
00:37:14,573 --> 00:37:17,709
I'm not sure if he's a date
or just a friend.

691
00:37:17,744 --> 00:37:20,212
I mean, what I do know
is that she's very attractive

692
00:37:20,246 --> 00:37:21,380
and men like her,

693
00:37:21,414 --> 00:37:24,784
so if you want a chance,
you better move fast.

694
00:37:24,818 --> 00:37:29,490
Right.

695
00:37:29,524 --> 00:37:33,495
Uh, I think I'm going
to go grab a beer.

696
00:37:33,529 --> 00:37:35,296
You know, this may sound weird,

697
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:37,800
and I don't mean
to sound creepy or anything,

698
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:39,835
but I think I really like you.

699
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,707
Aww.
I like you, too.

700
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:45,910
I'm not really ready
to call you "Dad,"

701
00:37:45,944 --> 00:37:48,513
but, uh, you're cool.

702
00:37:48,547 --> 00:37:49,915
"Cool"?

703
00:37:49,949 --> 00:37:51,750
Usually, I'm the only one
that calls me that.

704
00:37:51,785 --> 00:37:53,786
So that's awesome.

705
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,489
Oh, hey.
I got you something.

706
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,490
What?

707
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,293
It's really not a big deal.

708
00:38:01,763 --> 00:38:04,800
It's not a big deal?
You're giving me $5,000?

709
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:05,801
- Hey...
- Why?

710
00:38:05,835 --> 00:38:07,035
I know you could really use it.

711
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,005
But you should know
that that's really all

712
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,339
that I can afford.

713
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:11,340
I don't understand.

714
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,408
How do you know
that I could use it?

715
00:38:12,443 --> 00:38:13,444
Well, you know,

716
00:38:13,478 --> 00:38:16,246
I just did a little research
on you.

717
00:38:16,281 --> 00:38:19,217
You checked into me?
Like a criminal?

718
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:21,653
No, I just wanted to make sure

719
00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:23,255
you were who you said you were.

720
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:26,559
And that I wasn't after you
for your money?

721
00:38:26,593 --> 00:38:29,196
- I just--
- Look, I have debts,

722
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,464
but they're soon to be paid,

723
00:38:30,498 --> 00:38:32,600
and that's not really
any of your business.

724
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:34,769
I wouldn't ask you for this.

725
00:38:34,803 --> 00:38:36,204
I'm really sorry.

726
00:38:36,238 --> 00:38:37,873
Do you understand
that it was really hard

727
00:38:37,907 --> 00:38:40,309
for me to do this?
To find my father?

728
00:38:40,343 --> 00:38:41,611
But I felt like it was worth it

729
00:38:41,645 --> 00:38:42,846
to get to know you.

730
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,414
You know, maybe I was wrong.

731
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:46,283
Here you go.
No, thank you.

732
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:48,452
- Hey, Niki--
- All right, everyone.

733
00:38:48,487 --> 00:38:50,321
I'd like to make a toast.

734
00:38:50,355 --> 00:38:54,359
To the best kid sister
a guy could ever have, Jamie.

735
00:38:54,393 --> 00:38:56,229
Aww, thank you.

736
00:38:56,263 --> 00:38:57,730
I love you.
Happy Birthday.

737
00:38:57,765 --> 00:38:59,699
I love you, too.

738
00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:00,734
Aww, thank you, guys.

739
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:02,669
Thank you so much for coming.

740
00:39:02,704 --> 00:39:05,940
You guys are the best,
and it really is so nice

741
00:39:05,975 --> 00:39:08,610
to have you all
here in one place together.

742
00:39:08,644 --> 00:39:10,880
I love you guys.
Cheers.

743
00:39:10,914 --> 00:39:13,849
Happy Birthday.

744
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:18,956
And here's to you,
Sergeant Quinn.

745
00:39:18,991 --> 00:39:20,091
I know it's premature,
but I just wanted--

746
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:22,493
- Way premature.
- You didn't tell her?

747
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:24,830
I didn't want to upset her
on her birthday.

748
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:27,099
No.

749
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:30,470
You didn't get the job?

750
00:39:30,504 --> 00:39:31,571
You didn't give it to him?

751
00:39:31,605 --> 00:39:32,807
I had to go with the person

752
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:34,074
I thought would be
best for the job.

753
00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:35,342
And how is that not Joey?

754
00:39:35,377 --> 00:39:36,343
Hey, it's okay.

755
00:39:36,378 --> 00:39:37,979
He gave the promotion
to Miller.

756
00:39:38,014 --> 00:39:39,080
It's--you know.

757
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:40,649
But going for sergeant

758
00:39:40,683 --> 00:39:42,785
was your idea
in the first place.

759
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,153
You set him up.

760
00:39:44,188 --> 00:39:45,588
I didn't mean to--

761
00:39:45,622 --> 00:39:48,358
Jesus, Angel.

762
00:39:53,532 --> 00:39:55,466
- Hey.
- Dexter, hi.

763
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:56,902
How are you?

764
00:39:56,937 --> 00:39:58,204
I'm great.
You?

765
00:39:58,238 --> 00:40:00,539
Great.
Nice party, huh?

766
00:40:00,574 --> 00:40:04,211
Yeah.

767
00:40:04,245 --> 00:40:05,880
The beach.

768
00:40:05,914 --> 00:40:07,248
Yeah.

769
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:09,383
Harrison looks like
he's having a really nice time.

770
00:40:09,418 --> 00:40:12,387
Yep.

771
00:40:12,422 --> 00:40:14,823
Uh, Dexter, this is Oliver.
Oliver, Dexter.

772
00:40:14,858 --> 00:40:17,327
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

773
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:18,442
I didn't know if you wanted

774
00:40:18,462 --> 00:40:20,397
the Belgian brown
or the oatmeal stout

775
00:40:20,432 --> 00:40:21,665
or the German Pilsner,

776
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,000
so I just got you the one
with the moose on it.

777
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:24,101
Can't go wrong with a moose.

778
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,375
I'm going to go
check on Harrison.

779
00:40:29,409 --> 00:40:32,812
Okay, take care.

780
00:40:32,846 --> 00:40:34,648
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, that's great.

781
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,984
- That's your neighbor, right?
- Yes.

782
00:40:46,563 --> 00:40:49,399
What happened with Susan?
Wyman break up with her?

783
00:40:49,433 --> 00:40:51,034
Yeah.
Yeah, he did.

784
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:53,037
So it's a win.

785
00:40:53,071 --> 00:40:55,339
Why do you look like someone
just ran over your dog?

786
00:40:55,374 --> 00:40:56,774
I just got off the phone
with her,

787
00:40:56,775 --> 00:40:59,311
and she couldn't stop crying.

788
00:40:59,345 --> 00:41:00,679
She thinks it's all her fault,

789
00:41:00,713 --> 00:41:04,150
like somehow, she's not
good enough or something.

790
00:41:04,184 --> 00:41:07,388
Well, she would've caught
him cheating eventually.

791
00:41:07,422 --> 00:41:10,224
The result
would have been the same.

792
00:41:10,258 --> 00:41:14,496
Yeah, but it wouldn't be me
that made her cry.

793
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,633
Jesus, I just feel like shit.

794
00:41:17,668 --> 00:41:19,201
People can't help
sticking their noses in

795
00:41:19,236 --> 00:41:21,972
when it's someone
they care about.

796
00:41:22,006 --> 00:41:23,840
I know.

797
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:26,878
I know.
You tried to tell me.

798
00:41:29,315 --> 00:41:32,751
So does that mean
you care about me?

799
00:41:32,786 --> 00:41:37,457
Only to the extent
that you sign my paycheck.

800
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:40,094
Touche.

801
00:41:40,128 --> 00:41:42,463
Okay, what are we
going to read tonight?

802
00:41:42,497 --> 00:41:43,898
Let me guess.
"Wee Monkeys."

803
00:41:43,932 --> 00:41:44,900
"Wee Monkeys."

804
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:56,613
Before I read to you,

805
00:41:56,648 --> 00:42:00,819
I gotta talk to you
about the TV remote.

806
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:01,934
You said you didn't take it,

807
00:42:01,954 --> 00:42:05,191
but Jamie found it
under your bed.

808
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,931
I didn't mean to break it.

809
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:13,001
I was pretending
it was a thunder blaster,

810
00:42:13,035 --> 00:42:15,803
and I dropped it
in the kitchen.

811
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:18,007
Well, yeah, that's okay.
Accidents happen.

812
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:19,641
But you lied to me.
That's a big deal.

813
00:42:19,676 --> 00:42:23,046
We should never lie.

814
00:42:25,516 --> 00:42:28,352
But, daddy,

815
00:42:28,387 --> 00:42:32,691
you lie.

816
00:42:32,725 --> 00:42:36,029
What do you mean?

817
00:42:47,009 --> 00:42:49,544
You told me doggy got lost.

818
00:42:49,578 --> 00:42:52,314
I saw you
throw him in the trash.

819
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:54,885
I had to rescue him.

820
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:02,860
You're right.
I lied.

821
00:43:02,895 --> 00:43:06,465
Doggy got dirty, and I tried
to clean him up,

822
00:43:06,499 --> 00:43:09,869
and when I couldn't,
I threw him away.

823
00:43:09,904 --> 00:43:12,172
I'm sorry I lied to you,
Harrison.

824
00:43:12,206 --> 00:43:15,276
That's okay.
But can I keep him?

825
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:16,744
I really love him.

826
00:43:16,778 --> 00:43:19,781
He's soaked in blood
that links me to a murder.

827
00:43:19,816 --> 00:43:22,652
Yeah, but maybe he should live
under the bed.

828
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:25,121
- Okay.
- Okay.

829
00:43:25,155 --> 00:43:26,456
"Wee Monkeys."

830
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:28,759
"Wee Monkeys"!

831
00:43:28,793 --> 00:43:30,194
It's no accident,

832
00:43:30,228 --> 00:43:32,997
Harrison catching me in a lie.

833
00:43:33,032 --> 00:43:34,365
I can live with my lies,

834
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,637
but how long can Harrison
before he finally sees through?

835
00:43:38,672 --> 00:43:40,606
I should be back
in a few hours.

836
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,610
Sorry to keep you late
on your birthday.

837
00:43:43,644 --> 00:43:46,380
Trust me, it'll probably be
the highlight of my day.

838
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,516
Vogel doesn't want me
to kill Zach,

839
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,750
but she's wrong about him.

840
00:43:49,785 --> 00:43:53,589
He deserves nothing
but my table.

841
00:43:53,623 --> 00:43:55,157
He's here.

842
00:43:58,496 --> 00:44:02,233
Hey, Zach, it's Dexter.

843
00:44:24,861 --> 00:44:27,429
Where is he?

844
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:37,943
Why would Zach
buy a car for $1,200?

845
00:44:37,977 --> 00:44:40,145
Because the one mistake he made
with Norma Rivera

846
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,383
was showing up to kill her
in a red Porsche.

847
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:46,819
He's going
to kill Sofia tonight.

848
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:04,174
Cypress Harbor Yacht Club.

849
00:45:04,209 --> 00:45:05,175
Yes, hi, could you tell me

850
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,712
if Sofia Fuentes
is working tonight?

851
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:08,913
She gets off here
in a few minutes.

852
00:45:08,948 --> 00:45:11,016
Thank you.

853
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:33,978
Zach, waiting to make his move.

854
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:48,428
And Quinn, still trying
to prove he's a good cop.

855
00:45:58,275 --> 00:45:59,975
- He Dex.
- Hey.

856
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:03,847
Look, this is probably
none of my business,

857
00:46:03,881 --> 00:46:06,416
but I feel like I should
tell you about Quinn.

858
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:08,152
Okay.

859
00:46:08,186 --> 00:46:10,588
He thinks you're going
to break up with him.

860
00:46:10,622 --> 00:46:12,324
Break up with him?
Why?

861
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:13,992
'Cause he didn't make sergeant.

862
00:46:14,027 --> 00:46:16,562
That's crazy.

863
00:46:16,597 --> 00:46:17,630
Why would he think that?

864
00:46:17,665 --> 00:46:20,700
Maybe you should, um,
invite him over.

865
00:46:20,734 --> 00:46:22,169
I think he's feeling
pretty down.

866
00:46:22,203 --> 00:46:23,871
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

867
00:46:23,905 --> 00:46:25,807
Thanks, Dex, for calling.

868
00:46:25,841 --> 00:46:27,609
That really is so sweet of you.

869
00:46:27,643 --> 00:46:31,480
Sure.

870
00:46:48,735 --> 00:46:52,305
Quinn problem solved.

871
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,509
And there's Sofia.

872
00:47:02,051 --> 00:47:05,288
Zach's father.

873
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,023
Sofia is Hamilton's mistress,

874
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:10,294
just like Norma before her.

875
00:47:36,794 --> 00:47:37,927
What is he doing?

876
00:48:11,035 --> 00:48:12,369
Hey.

877
00:48:12,403 --> 00:48:13,738
I know what you're doing.

878
00:48:13,772 --> 00:48:15,106
Quinn.

879
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:20,712
You playing detective?
Watching Zach?

880
00:48:20,747 --> 00:48:22,381
Yeah, you caught me.

881
00:48:22,415 --> 00:48:25,685
I'm going to see Jamie.
Keep an eye on Zach.

882
00:48:33,763 --> 00:48:36,933
Jesus.
What the fuck?

883
00:48:36,967 --> 00:48:41,605
What are you doing?

884
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:44,174
Why were you going
to kill your father?

885
00:48:44,209 --> 00:48:45,209
What are you talking about?

886
00:48:45,243 --> 00:48:46,244
I wasn't trying
to kill my--

887
00:48:46,278 --> 00:48:47,879
I know you killed
Norma Rivera.

888
00:48:47,913 --> 00:48:49,647
I thought you were going
to kill Sofia.

889
00:48:49,682 --> 00:48:51,650
But you were going
after your father.

890
00:48:51,685 --> 00:48:53,486
- Why?
- You're crazy.

891
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,756
I didn't try
and kill my father.

892
00:48:56,791 --> 00:49:01,529
You tell me one more lie,
and I'll kill you.

893
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,464
- I had to.
- Why?

894
00:49:03,499 --> 00:49:06,702
Because he's killing my mother.

895
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:10,139
She's drinking herself to death
because of him.

896
00:49:10,174 --> 00:49:12,308
Over the years,
one affair after another,

897
00:49:12,343 --> 00:49:15,212
and he doesn't even
try and hide it.

898
00:49:15,247 --> 00:49:18,115
I-I thought killing Norma
would put an end to it,

899
00:49:18,149 --> 00:49:19,317
but two days later,

900
00:49:19,352 --> 00:49:23,255
he's banging some hostess
from the club.

901
00:49:23,289 --> 00:49:24,891
I knew if I wanted it to stop,

902
00:49:24,925 --> 00:49:27,293
I had to kill dad.

903
00:49:29,964 --> 00:49:32,299
So that's what this
is all about,

904
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:35,169
you trying to protect
your mother?

905
00:49:35,204 --> 00:49:36,638
You actually care about her?

906
00:49:36,672 --> 00:49:40,109
Of course I do.
She's my mother.

907
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:49,520
But showing up
at crime scenes, accidents,

908
00:49:49,555 --> 00:49:53,058
taking pictures
of all the blood,

909
00:49:53,092 --> 00:49:55,160
this is about more than
just your mother, isn't it?

910
00:49:55,194 --> 00:49:57,196
No, I had to protect her.

911
00:49:57,231 --> 00:49:59,966
Yeah, I believe you.

912
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,236
But you killed
because you want to kill.

913
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:06,474
- No.
- Yes.

914
00:50:06,509 --> 00:50:09,945
To take a living person

915
00:50:09,979 --> 00:50:13,983
and make them dead,

916
00:50:14,017 --> 00:50:17,187
imagining that you
can actually hear the moment

917
00:50:17,221 --> 00:50:20,558
when their heart stops beating,

918
00:50:20,593 --> 00:50:25,164
smell the blood
as it pools across the floor.

919
00:50:29,202 --> 00:50:32,172
I can't help it.

920
00:50:34,543 --> 00:50:37,612
It just builds up inside me,

921
00:50:37,646 --> 00:50:39,648
all these years.

922
00:50:39,682 --> 00:50:42,718
But Norma was the first time
I ever followed through.

923
00:50:42,752 --> 00:50:45,254
And how was it,

924
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:48,892
once you'd killed her?

925
00:50:48,927 --> 00:50:52,196
It--it felt like
this huge weight

926
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:55,100
was lifted off my chest,

927
00:50:55,134 --> 00:51:00,239
this release of something
horrible inside me.

928
00:51:03,211 --> 00:51:05,912
Like you were finally
in control.

929
00:51:05,947 --> 00:51:08,616
Yes.

930
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:18,028
You should just go ahead
and kill me.

931
00:51:18,062 --> 00:51:19,496
Why?

932
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:25,269
'Cause if you don't,
I know I'll do it again.

933
00:51:25,303 --> 00:51:26,571
I don't want to be like this,

934
00:51:26,606 --> 00:51:31,377
but I can't help it.

935
00:51:31,412 --> 00:51:33,212
I just am.

936
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,516
I'm some kind of freak.

937
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,985
A monster.

938
00:51:38,019 --> 00:51:42,223
Yes.

939
00:51:42,258 --> 00:51:44,393
You haven't told anyone else
about this, have you?

940
00:51:44,428 --> 00:51:46,295
Besides Dr. Vogel.

941
00:51:46,329 --> 00:51:49,499
No, I couldn't.

942
00:51:49,534 --> 00:51:53,270
You never had a Harry.

943
00:51:53,304 --> 00:51:55,606
A what?

944
00:51:55,641 --> 00:51:58,877
Someone to talk to.

945
00:52:01,114 --> 00:52:04,417
Someone to teach you.

946
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,989
Some things happen to us
by accident.

947
00:52:09,024 --> 00:52:11,992
Others are choices.

948
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:14,396
There are parts of me
that I can never share

949
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:15,931
with my own son.

950
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:18,401
But with Zach--

951
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,436
could I teach him?

952
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:22,706
Am I ready for this,

953
00:52:22,741 --> 00:52:25,375
to be a spiritual father?

954
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:34,453
So how'd your sting go
with Elway?

955
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:37,023
Terribly.

956
00:52:37,058 --> 00:52:39,426
Didn't work out?

957
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,629
No, it worked out fine,
but--

958
00:52:41,663 --> 00:52:44,665
What?

959
00:52:46,703 --> 00:52:48,470
He likes me.

960
00:52:48,505 --> 00:52:50,707
Oh.

961
00:52:50,741 --> 00:52:52,041
That's a bad thing?

962
00:52:52,076 --> 00:52:53,476
Well, he likes me
'cause he doesn't know

963
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:56,781
a fucking thing about me.

964
00:52:56,815 --> 00:52:58,382
"Yeah, I killed two people,

965
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:01,086
"and tried to kill myself
and my brother.

966
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,822
But sorry, what kind of wine
would you like to order?"

967
00:53:03,856 --> 00:53:06,659
I mean, what the fuck?

968
00:53:06,693 --> 00:53:10,297
Yeah, I kind of know
what you mean.

969
00:53:10,331 --> 00:53:13,100
How are things with Cassie?

970
00:53:13,134 --> 00:53:18,139
Um, yeah, I don't think
there's much of a future there.

971
00:53:18,175 --> 00:53:21,043
Maybe the Morgans just
aren't meant for relationships.

972
00:53:21,077 --> 00:53:26,216
Yeah, maybe not.

973
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,417
But hey, life is good.

974
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:28,553
You know,
I'm feeling optimistic

975
00:53:28,587 --> 00:53:30,054
for the first time in a while.

976
00:53:30,088 --> 00:53:31,455
I'm even thinking
about taking on

977
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:36,428
a kind of...intern.

978
00:53:36,462 --> 00:53:39,165
Hmm.

979
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,567
Well, that's a big step
for you, right?

980
00:53:40,601 --> 00:53:45,606
Letting some novice
into your private lab.

981
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,845
Yeah.

982
00:53:49,879 --> 00:53:51,781
Hey, are you okay?

983
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:54,116
I don't feel so good.

984
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:56,854
What's wrong?

985
00:53:56,888 --> 00:53:59,256
I feel kind of dizzy.

986
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:02,227
Deb?

987
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:12,038
Hello, Dexter.

988
00:54:12,073 --> 00:54:14,942
Remember me?

989
00:54:16,223 --> 00:54:26,920
