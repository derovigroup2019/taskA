00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:56,116
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,785
- You can't kill me.
- Why?

4
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,488
Because I don't fit
Harry's code.

5
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,390
Trust me when I say that
there's a place

6
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:04,558
in this world for your son.

7
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:05,659
You're perfect.

8
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,827
How can you still say that

9
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:07,994
when you know
what I've done to Deb?

10
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,162
Uhh!

11
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:12,532
I shot the wrong person
in that trailer.

12
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,868
Why'd you save me?
Why didn't you let me drown?

13
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:16,702
I couldn't imagine my life
without you in it.

14
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,471
I'm glad to see
that you two have managed

15
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,172
to find your way
back to each other.

16
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,874
Well, the family
that kills together...

17
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,009
Zach's killer is
related to you.

18
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,211
The Brain Surgeon...
is related to you.

19
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,346
Daniel.

20
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,014
He's going by the name
of Oliver Saxon.

21
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,783
- What are you going to do?
- What do you think?

22
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,283
He's my son.

23
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:36,020
- I still have feelings for you.
- I just--

24
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:37,489
Remember me?

25
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,490
Where do you think you'll go?

26
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,691
I haven't decided.

27
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,260
Argentina.

28
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,465
Me, you, and Harrison
are gonna move to Argentina.

29
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:49,466
I've got a line
on Hannah McKay,

30
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,168
but I'm gonna need your help
reeling her in.

31
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:52,937
But he's on to you,
and you gotta move fast.

32
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:54,638
I tried to get an earlier
flight, but it's booked solid

33
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,107
'cause of the storm.

34
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:58,976
I have a proposal.
We walk away.

35
00:02:58,977 --> 00:03:01,178
You went out of your way to
kill your mother in front of me,

36
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:02,679
and you just expect me
to forget?

37
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,281
Evelyn?

38
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:07,183
This is usually
my favorite moment, the kill.

39
00:03:07,184 --> 00:03:09,452
Now, I don't even
wanna be here.

40
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:10,620
Hey, Deb, change of plans.

41
00:03:10,621 --> 00:03:12,889
Go get on a plane.

42
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,757
Last site someone
visited on this computer

43
00:03:14,758 --> 00:03:17,193
was for an Aero Sudamerica.

44
00:03:17,194 --> 00:03:18,561
I'm gonna tail the Morgans,

45
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:19,695
see if they'll lead me to her.

46
00:03:19,696 --> 00:03:20,695
Aah! Aah!

47
00:03:20,696 --> 00:03:21,696
What the fuck is going on here?

48
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:23,098
Help me, please!

49
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:26,501
- Unh!
- Agh!

50
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:28,437
Don't move.

51
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:30,406
I used to live my life
at night,

52
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:32,541
in the shadow
of my Dark Passenger.

53
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:35,144
But, over the years,
my eyes adjusted,

54
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:36,744
and I could see.

55
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:39,547
And now, what's in focus
is my future.

56
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:40,781
Bright.

57
00:03:40,782 --> 00:03:43,384
Brighter than it's ever been.

58
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:45,519
This is Detective Debra Morgan.

59
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,955
I've been shot.

60
00:03:54,696 --> 00:03:56,330
Are we almost there?

61
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:58,532
It's, uh, Gate 209.
Just a couple more.

62
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,033
I want some Oreos.

63
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:01,301
There'll be food on the plane.

64
00:04:01,302 --> 00:04:02,903
Come on, you promised
to help me count.

65
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:04,738
- 210.
- There you go.

66
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,841
I always thought
that if I ever left Miami,

67
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:09,976
I'd be running for my life...

68
00:04:09,977 --> 00:04:11,744
not running towards a new one.

69
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:13,412
211!

70
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:18,150
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll begin boarding

71
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:20,653
Flight 691 to Rio de Janeiro
in a few moments.

72
00:04:20,654 --> 00:04:22,689
To ensure an on-time departure
we ask that you have

73
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,592
your tickets and passports
ready for the attendant.

74
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:28,159
Where's Hannah?

75
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,566
- Hannah?
- Hey, where are you?

76
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,167
I'm at the gate.
Where are you?

77
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:39,538
I'm in the ladies' room, Dex.
Elway is in the boarding area.

78
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,941
Come here, buddy.

79
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:45,442
Attention passengers.

80
00:04:45,443 --> 00:04:47,612
We now begin pre-boarding
for Aero Sudamerica

81
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:49,614
Flight 691 to Rio de Janeiro.

82
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:51,081
He didn't see me.
Did he see you?

83
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,182
No, I don't think so.

84
00:04:52,183 --> 00:04:53,918
He's got a clear view
of the jetway.

85
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,753
He must have bought a ticket
to get through security.

86
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,321
We won't be able to board
without being spotted.

87
00:04:58,322 --> 00:05:00,490
And he's right between
you and the exit.

88
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:01,591
Dex, I just heard them.

89
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,832
Our plane is boarding
right now.

90
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:10,800
Stay where you are.
I'll call you right back.

91
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:12,468
Okay.

92
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:14,069
Hey...

93
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,070
you want some Oreos?

94
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:16,304
Yay!

95
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:17,806
Come on.

96
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:24,312
Why don't you grab something
for the flight?

97
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:26,615
- Nothing too big.
- Okay.

98
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:31,686
The storm is coming fast...

99
00:05:40,162 --> 00:05:42,063
At this time,
we'll now be boarding

100
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:43,665
all passengers
in business class.

101
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,331
All passengers, stand by...

102
00:05:50,438 --> 00:05:52,138
Hey, excuse me.

103
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,240
Hi. I have tickets
on this flight.

104
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:56,342
I'm a forensic analyst
with Miami Metro.

105
00:05:56,343 --> 00:05:58,045
- Yes?
- I don't want to tell you

106
00:05:58,046 --> 00:06:01,146
how to do your job,
but I just saw a guy

107
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:03,282
drop that bag under that chair

108
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:04,717
and then just walk away.

109
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:07,086
I thought maybe he forgot it,
but it really looked

110
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:08,454
like he left it there
on purpose.

111
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:09,956
Did you see where he went?

112
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:11,390
Yeah, he's, uh...

113
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:13,926
right over there, on the phone.

114
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:15,494
I know
it's probably nothing, but...

115
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:17,963
like they say, "If you see
something, say something."

116
00:06:17,964 --> 00:06:20,531
Thanks.

117
00:06:20,532 --> 00:06:22,734
Security, this is Casey
at Gate 211.

118
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:25,570
There's a Caucasian male...

119
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:27,371
Deputy Marshal,
it's Elway again.

120
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:28,907
Third message.
I'm still at the airport.

121
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:30,909
I still think Hannah McKay's
trying to leave the country.

122
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,610
Call me back
as soon as you can.

123
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:33,744
Thank you.

124
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:34,878
- Sir...
- Oh, that's okay.

125
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,146
- You can stack that.
- Airport security.

126
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:37,648
Need you to come with us,
please.

127
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:39,216
What?
What happened?

128
00:06:39,217 --> 00:06:40,450
Just got to ask you
a few questions.

129
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:41,719
What the hell is this about?

130
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,786
I'm gonna miss my flight.

131
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:44,387
Sir, I need you
to do what I ask.

132
00:06:44,388 --> 00:06:45,856
This way.

133
00:06:45,857 --> 00:06:48,758
You gotta be fuckin'
kidding me.

134
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:51,761
Hey.

135
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:53,129
Okay, the coast is clear.

136
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,864
- Elway's gone.
- Okay.

137
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:56,265
Ladies and gentlemen,

138
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:58,067
- due to a security concern...
- Let's go see Hannah.

139
00:06:58,068 --> 00:07:02,105
...it is necessary at this time
for all passengers

140
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:04,426
- to exit the boarding area...
- Clear this area right now.

141
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:12,648
What did you do?

142
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,415
Put Elway
on the no-fly list.

143
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,519
Unfortunately,
now we're not flying either.

144
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,987
Come on, bud.

145
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:30,531
All right, let's move her.

146
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:32,633
Stabbed in the heart.
Pretty quick.

147
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:34,802
His gun is missing too.

148
00:07:34,803 --> 00:07:36,803
We're going to assume
Saxon still has it.

149
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:39,472
I'm calling your brother.

150
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:41,474
No, he's leaving with Harrison.

151
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:42,709
If you tell him what happened,
he'll stay.

152
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,711
- Deb--
- I swear to fucking God,

153
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:46,746
I'm not getting on that
ambulance if you call him.

154
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:48,314
Okay.

155
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:50,116
I'm gonna ride with you
to the hospital.

156
00:07:50,117 --> 00:07:51,151
No problem, sir.

157
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:52,618
For once, do not argue with me.

158
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:53,986
I'm in the ambulance.
That's it.

159
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:55,187
You're such a fuckin' asshole.

160
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:56,789
Yeah, he signed it.
He's inside.

161
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,157
I'll meet you at the hospital.

162
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:00,659
I'm right behind you.

163
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:14,271
Miami Central,
this is Rescue 6.

164
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:16,032
We're transporting
Lieutenant Debra Morgan...

165
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:20,078
- You're all right.
- Hurts like a motherfucker.

166
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,413
Ooh.

167
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:24,381
I really hate getting shot.

168
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:25,982
You need to stop that.

169
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:27,851
Uhh!

170
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:32,222
I really thought that was it.

171
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:33,656
I thought I was gonna die.

172
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:35,558
No.
You're gonna live forever.

173
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,294
Ah!

174
00:08:38,295 --> 00:08:40,830
I thought maybe I was
getting what I deserved.

175
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:42,832
What you deserve?

176
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,399
Why would you think that?

177
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:56,212
I've done shit
I'm not proud of.

178
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:58,646
Stuff I can't take back.

179
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:01,015
Think I haven't done shit
I'm not proud of?

180
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,887
It's not the same.

181
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:09,223
I know.
You went through a bad time.

182
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:11,892
But I fucked up too, Deb.

183
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:12,960
A lot.

184
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:18,598
But I think we get
to make up for it, you know?

185
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,900
Uhh.

186
00:09:20,901 --> 00:09:22,468
How?

187
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:24,436
You do enough good
in the world,

188
00:09:24,437 --> 00:09:27,706
it sort of cancels out the bad.

189
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:30,943
I think I would need
to save a busload of nuns

190
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:32,011
or something.

191
00:09:32,012 --> 00:09:33,880
You're a good person.

192
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:35,882
A lot better than most.

193
00:09:35,883 --> 00:09:37,883
Now that you're back
on the force,

194
00:09:37,884 --> 00:09:38,984
you're gonna have
a million chances

195
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:40,551
to do good.

196
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:43,989
Maybe even save that
busload of nuns.

197
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,691
If they're like the ones
I had in school,

198
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:48,493
let 'em go.

199
00:09:48,494 --> 00:09:50,896
Come here.

200
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:55,666
Hey.

201
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,902
I'm gonna be right here, okay?

202
00:09:57,903 --> 00:10:00,070
We both are.

203
00:10:00,071 --> 00:10:01,405
Her vitals are stable.

204
00:10:01,406 --> 00:10:04,308
- Let's get her into surgery.
- I love you, Joey.

205
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:06,576
What's that?

206
00:10:13,684 --> 00:10:15,551
So?

207
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:16,886
She's on her way
to surgery now.

208
00:10:16,887 --> 00:10:17,954
She took one in the gut.

209
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:20,256
We don't know
how bad it is yet.

210
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:21,657
Where's Dexter?

211
00:10:21,658 --> 00:10:23,159
Deb asked us not to call him.

212
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,427
She what?

213
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:25,861
She says he's on
a trip with Harrison.

214
00:10:25,862 --> 00:10:27,595
She didn't want to worry him,
but I say screw that.

215
00:10:27,596 --> 00:10:29,476
- He's gotta know.
- Damn right he's gotta know.

216
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:34,970
Due to
a possible security concern,

217
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:36,872
we are evacuating the terminal.

218
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:44,078
It's Matthews.

219
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,880
Hello?

220
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:48,482
Dexter, Saxon escaped
after shooting Debra.

221
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:51,485
No.

222
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:52,553
Well, thank you for telling me.

223
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:53,988
I'll be right there.

224
00:10:55,523 --> 00:10:56,890
What's wrong?

225
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:58,892
It's Debra.

226
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:01,228
What?

227
00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:03,129
Come on, bud.

228
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:07,200
Saxon shot her and got away.

229
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:11,872
Is she okay?

230
00:11:11,873 --> 00:11:13,739
She's in the hospital
getting ready

231
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,274
to go into surgery.

232
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,142
Is Aunt Deb sick?

233
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,310
Uh, just a little.

234
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,545
But the doctors
are fixing her up right now.

235
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,048
We need to go to her.

236
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,951
I'll take you back
to the hotel.

237
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,120
We should fly
into a different country.

238
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,820
They're only gonna
hold Elway for so long,

239
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:31,789
and you know he's gonna
hit all the flights to Rio.

240
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,258
There may not be
any more flights, Dexter.

241
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,558
I heard people saying
that they were

242
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,227
going to close the airport
to wait out the storm.

243
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,495
We should leave
from another city.

244
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:38,897
See what you can find online.

245
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,231
Well, what about you?

246
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,565
- I'll join you when I can.
- But--

247
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,968
Don't worry.
We'll make this work.

248
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:56,880
One bag of ice
and one gallon of water.

249
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:58,815
- Can I get one more?
- Only one bag.

250
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:13,862
Ohh!

251
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,843
- Hi, Jamie!
- Hey, Harrison.

252
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:31,313
So tell me all about
your adventures...

253
00:12:31,314 --> 00:12:32,914
How is she?

254
00:12:32,915 --> 00:12:34,114
Still in surgery.

255
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:36,716
Yeah, we were unable
to speak to the doctor

256
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:39,053
before she went in.

257
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:40,821
Your sister's tough.

258
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:43,057
Just like your old man was.

259
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:45,459
Yeah, Dex.
She's gonna pull through.

260
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,363
Due to severe weather...

261
00:12:50,364 --> 00:12:51,897
This is Deputy
U.S. Marshal Clayton.

262
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:53,632
Please leave your name
and number after the beep.

263
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:55,401
Clayton, it's Elway.

264
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:56,702
Again.

265
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,004
Look, I don't know
where the hell you are.

266
00:12:58,005 --> 00:12:59,905
But I'll tell you this,
McKay's still in town.

267
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:01,774
With all the flights canceled,
I'm sure she's looking

268
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:03,209
for another way out of here.

269
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,377
I put the word out
to all of my contacts,

270
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:06,811
and I'll tell you this--
with what I pay these people,

271
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:09,114
if she walks through a hotel
lobby, a car rental agency,

272
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:12,650
a bus, a train station,
I'm gonna hear about that shit.

273
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:14,552
All right...I'll try you
at your field office,

274
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:15,753
see if I can get you there.

275
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:24,695
U.S. Marshal's service.
How may I direct your call?

276
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:26,597
Yeah, this is Jacob Elway.

277
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,165
Listen, I've been working
an investigation

278
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,900
with Deputy Marshal Clayton.
I've been trying like hell--

279
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,302
I guess you haven't
heard the news, sir.

280
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:32,403
What?

281
00:13:32,404 --> 00:13:34,771
Clayton was involved
in a shooting.

282
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,107
I'm afraid he was killed
in the line of duty.

283
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,423
Why aren't you in Argentina?

284
00:13:57,027 --> 00:13:58,827
Why do you think?

285
00:14:02,432 --> 00:14:04,366
I told them not to call you.

286
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:07,536
Well, I'm glad they did.

287
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:15,809
How come we never went hiking
when we were kids?

288
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,746
Hiking?

289
00:14:18,747 --> 00:14:22,316
Climbing.

290
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:24,919
Mountains.

291
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,253
Hiking.

292
00:14:26,254 --> 00:14:27,754
I don't know--
'cause it's hard

293
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:29,589
to find a mountain in Florida?

294
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:37,597
There are mountains
in South America.

295
00:14:37,598 --> 00:14:39,433
All over the place.

296
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,104
Why are you
looking at me like that?

297
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:54,180
Or is that just your face?

298
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:56,315
Uhh.

299
00:14:56,316 --> 00:14:59,650
I should never have
left Saxon alive.

300
00:14:59,651 --> 00:15:01,319
It's not your fault.

301
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,758
Clayton fucked everything up.

302
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,727
Bad luck.

303
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:12,630
No, it's more than that.

304
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:15,165
Ever since you found out
who I am...

305
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:26,843
I've screwed up your life, Deb.

306
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:32,115
It's not yours
to screw up, Dexter.

307
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:34,083
I am responsible for my life.

308
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:35,618
Do you hear me?

309
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:42,225
I don't want you to feel guilty
about this.

310
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:43,892
I don't want you to feel
guilty about anything.

311
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:45,527
You hear me?

312
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:49,164
You were meant to be happy,

313
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:51,666
so you need to go
fuckin' be happy.

314
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,404
Okay.

315
00:15:56,405 --> 00:15:59,040
Hello there.

316
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,575
Dr. Kruper.

317
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,075
Uh, Dexter.
I'm Debra's brother.

318
00:16:02,076 --> 00:16:04,145
Ah, nice to meet you.

319
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:08,282
Okay, just gonna
check your stomach.

320
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:11,552
So how are you feeling
otherwise?

321
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,387
I wanna go hiking.

322
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:15,256
I wouldn't recommend that

323
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:17,757
for at least a few hours.

324
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:19,292
How is she?

325
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:21,927
That bullet
bounced around quite a bit.

326
00:16:21,928 --> 00:16:24,230
But it missed hitting
anything important.

327
00:16:24,231 --> 00:16:25,731
You are very lucky.

328
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:28,000
So she's gonna be all right?

329
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:30,370
There is a lot of recovery
time ahead.

330
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:33,839
But...I'd say
we're looking pretty good.

331
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,440
I'm optimistic.

332
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:36,776
Thank you.

333
00:16:36,777 --> 00:16:38,510
Mm-hmm.

334
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:49,689
I bet Hannah loves Argentina.

335
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,658
Pretty blonde,
lots of attention.

336
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:54,926
Just her thing.

337
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:58,697
Hannah didn't make the flight.

338
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:03,402
Elway was there,
and we had to lose him.

339
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:04,403
That's my fault, Dex.

340
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:07,138
I put him on her.

341
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:10,709
That rat-face fuck.
I'm--

342
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,976
I'm sorry.

343
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:14,145
No, don't start
blaming yourself.

344
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:17,682
Coming from Mr. "I Screwed Up
Your Life, Deb."

345
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:23,187
I need to find another way

346
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:28,892
for Hannah to get
out of the country.

347
00:17:28,893 --> 00:17:31,361
I'm thinking of sending
Harrison with her now,

348
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:33,964
and meeting up with them
after you get out

349
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:36,399
and Saxon is taken care of.

350
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,668
You heard the doctor.
I'm fine.

351
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:40,302
You should go.
We'll get Saxon.

352
00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:42,471
- No.
- Dex, we'll get him.

353
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:45,208
Your life is waiting on you.
You should leave.

354
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:46,642
Deb...

355
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:49,511
The next word I want
to hear you say is good-bye.

356
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:52,849
Say it already,

357
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:57,285
or I'll crawl out of this bed
and kick your fuckin' ass.

358
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:01,522
Good-bye.

359
00:18:01,523 --> 00:18:04,059
I'll see you soon.

360
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,711
How's Aunt Deb?
Can see her?

361
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:26,413
Ah, she needs to rest.

362
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:30,583
But she's gonna visit us
real soon.

363
00:18:32,386 --> 00:18:33,686
Hey, did you know that
this is the hospital

364
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:36,689
where you were born?

365
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,557
- Really?
- Yeah.

366
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:39,625
Right down there.

367
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:42,928
It's the first time I saw you.

368
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:44,529
I was with Aunt Deb.

369
00:18:49,702 --> 00:18:52,204
Holy fuckin' shit.
There's another Morgan now.

370
00:18:52,205 --> 00:18:54,940
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

371
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:56,574
You're a father.

372
00:18:56,575 --> 00:18:58,543
Yeah, and you're an aunt.

373
00:18:58,544 --> 00:18:59,743
Jesus.

374
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:01,612
Did you and Rita
land on a name yet?

375
00:19:01,613 --> 00:19:02,914
Harrison.

376
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:06,283
Dad would love that.

377
00:19:06,284 --> 00:19:08,519
"Harrison."

378
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,688
I wanna hold him.

379
00:19:14,492 --> 00:19:16,092
Which one is yours?

380
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:17,494
I, um...

381
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:18,929
That's your son.

382
00:19:26,203 --> 00:19:27,937
Do you want to hold him?

383
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:29,271
- Yeah, I wanna hold him.
- Uh, he's sleeping.

384
00:19:29,272 --> 00:19:30,506
Let him sleep.

385
00:19:30,507 --> 00:19:32,508
He has his whole
fuckin' life to sleep.

386
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,747
He's so small.

387
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:41,082
Don't worry.
He'll grow.

388
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,285
How does it feel
to be a father?

389
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:46,988
I have no idea.

390
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:49,023
Everything's gonna
be different now.

391
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:51,426
I know.

392
00:19:57,999 --> 00:19:59,800
Hey, thanks for your call.

393
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:01,034
No problem.

394
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:04,338
How's Debra?

395
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:05,673
The doctor's optimistic.

396
00:20:05,674 --> 00:20:07,808
That's good to hear.

397
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:09,843
Listen, Dexter,
if there's anything I can do...

398
00:20:09,844 --> 00:20:12,612
Well, I'm probably
being paranoid, but...

399
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:14,280
Saxon is still out there.

400
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,516
You think you could put
a couple of unis on her room?

401
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:17,950
I'm already on it.

402
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:21,087
- Thanks.
- No problem.

403
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,992
Hey.
Hey, I just heard about Deb.

404
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,360
What happened?

405
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,661
Uh, it's a long story.

406
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,129
I don't really
have time to go into it.

407
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,767
You in a hurry to get back
to Hannah McKay?

408
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:36,334
I don't know
what you're talking about.

409
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,803
That's why Clayton
was following Deb.

410
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:39,505
He figured she was helping you
and Hannah leave the country.

411
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:40,773
And if that's true,
I guess you know

412
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:43,040
you're partially responsible
for his death.

413
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,142
Just stay away from me.

414
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,044
Storm's comin', buddy.

415
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,380
And it's gonna be real hard
to find a way out.

416
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,551
Don't go down with her, Dexter.

417
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,721
Son of a bitch.

418
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:04,027
The National Hurricane Center

419
00:21:04,028 --> 00:21:06,863
is reporting that Laura
is now just east of Cuba,

420
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:10,033
with sustained winds topping
100 miles per hour.

421
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:11,568
If it keeps on this
current course,

422
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:13,770
it could hit the keys
by sundown.

423
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:18,908
Shh. It's okay.

424
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:20,843
Shh. Hey.

425
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:21,844
It's okay.
It's okay.

426
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:24,680
Hey, we're closed.

427
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:28,084
Only reason I'm here
is to keep the animals calm to--

428
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:30,885
Stitch me up.

429
00:21:30,886 --> 00:21:32,887
Okay.

430
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:35,457
Okay, I'll do
whatever you need.

431
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,593
Miami's entire coast
is being evacuated,

432
00:21:38,594 --> 00:21:40,128
so we can use all the craziness

433
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:42,264
to get out of here
without being spotted again.

434
00:21:42,265 --> 00:21:45,167
They're lining up
evacuation buses.

435
00:21:45,168 --> 00:21:46,335
The bus?

436
00:21:46,336 --> 00:21:47,469
Yeah, the highways
are parking lots,

437
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,770
but the buses
have their own lanes,

438
00:21:48,771 --> 00:21:50,939
so we can take one
all the way up to Jacksonville

439
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,074
and fly out from there.

440
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:54,909
We'd better leave
for the bus station soon

441
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,511
if we're gonna make it on time.

442
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:01,516
What is it?

443
00:22:01,517 --> 00:22:06,086
Nothing.
It's a good plan.

444
00:22:06,087 --> 00:22:10,423
You're still worried
about Deb, aren't you?

445
00:22:10,424 --> 00:22:12,526
The doctor said
she's out of danger.

446
00:22:13,628 --> 00:22:16,329
Hey, we can, uh...

447
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,064
we can stick around--you know,
ride out the storm here.

448
00:22:19,065 --> 00:22:21,300
It's not safe
with Elway on the hunt.

449
00:22:21,301 --> 00:22:25,638
You need to get out of here,
the faster the better.

450
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:26,839
Well, I could, uh,
I could leave now

451
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,040
and you could meet me there.

452
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,842
I could even
take Harrison with me.

453
00:22:32,813 --> 00:22:35,947
Or I could, um, go alone.

454
00:22:35,948 --> 00:22:37,983
No, I have no problem
with you taking Harrison.

455
00:22:37,984 --> 00:22:39,718
I'd be happy to know
that he's with you.

456
00:22:42,522 --> 00:22:45,189
It's just that I don't
want to lose you again.

457
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,561
Even if it's just
for a couple of days.

458
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:01,872
Hurry up.

459
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:04,241
Almost finished.

460
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:07,911
One more stitch.

461
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,360
Please.

462
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:29,197
Just...go.
I won't say anything to anyone.

463
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:31,299
Special report
about one of Miami's finest,

464
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,868
Debra Morgan.

465
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,002
That's her.

466
00:23:34,003 --> 00:23:35,370
I'm here
at Miami Central Hospital

467
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:37,706
where a detective with
Miami Metro Homicide

468
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,140
is recovering from surgery
after having been shot.

469
00:23:40,141 --> 00:23:42,977
We have learned that a deputy
marshal died on the scene.

470
00:23:42,978 --> 00:23:45,680
The suspect, Oliver Saxon,
is still at large

471
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:48,215
and may have carjacked
a blue pickup truck.

472
00:23:48,216 --> 00:23:50,184
If you have any information
about the whereabouts...

473
00:23:50,185 --> 00:23:51,719
Get your car keys.

474
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,987
We're taking a drive.

475
00:23:52,988 --> 00:23:54,654
Can't you just let me go?

476
00:23:54,655 --> 00:23:57,356
Do what I said...

477
00:23:57,357 --> 00:23:59,559
and you won't get hurt.

478
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:04,731
Alright, keep moving,
no pushing.

479
00:24:04,732 --> 00:24:06,299
Oh, no, it's okay.

480
00:24:08,736 --> 00:24:11,403
You want me to carry that?

481
00:24:11,404 --> 00:24:13,138
Yeah. Wait.

482
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:15,340
Come here.

483
00:24:15,341 --> 00:24:17,676
All right, everyone,
please keep moving the line.

484
00:24:17,677 --> 00:24:19,244
It's Saxon.
He's still out there.

485
00:24:19,245 --> 00:24:20,646
I can't leave
until he's caught,

486
00:24:20,647 --> 00:24:23,816
until...Debra is safe.

487
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:24,850
I'm sorry.

488
00:24:24,851 --> 00:24:26,085
Sir, you need
to get back in line.

489
00:24:26,086 --> 00:24:29,187
It's, okay, I--
I understand.

490
00:24:29,188 --> 00:24:30,322
Here.

491
00:24:30,323 --> 00:24:31,889
Take Harrison.

492
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,191
I'll meet you down there.

493
00:24:33,192 --> 00:24:34,993
You sure?

494
00:24:34,994 --> 00:24:38,163
Yeah.
He'll be safer with you.

495
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:39,231
Take this.

496
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:41,733
It's just water, snacks.

497
00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:42,800
A few essentials.

498
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:46,337
Call me from the airport

499
00:24:46,338 --> 00:24:49,540
as soon as you know
that you made your flight.

500
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:51,175
I will.

501
00:24:53,878 --> 00:24:54,978
Harrison...

502
00:24:54,979 --> 00:24:56,413
you're gonna leave with Hannah.

503
00:24:56,414 --> 00:24:58,215
You're not coming with us?

504
00:24:58,216 --> 00:24:59,749
No, of course I am.

505
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,952
I just forgot a few things
I need to take care of.

506
00:25:02,953 --> 00:25:04,354
As soon as I do,
I'll meet you there.

507
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:06,055
I promise.

508
00:25:06,056 --> 00:25:10,960
I'm gonna miss you.

509
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:12,195
It's just for a little while.

510
00:25:12,196 --> 00:25:13,429
It'll be fun.

511
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,397
We're all going to
this really cool place,

512
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:17,432
and you're gonna
get there first, okay?

513
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,100
Now, I want you to mind Hannah.

514
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,002
You do what she says.

515
00:25:25,908 --> 00:25:28,076
You know what, daddy?

516
00:25:28,077 --> 00:25:29,211
What?

517
00:25:29,212 --> 00:25:32,046
I love Hannah.

518
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,085
So do I.

519
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,124
See you in Buenos Aires.

520
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,993
We'll be waiting.

521
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:54,234
This is the final boarding call

522
00:25:54,235 --> 00:25:58,037
for Mockingbird Bus 24
to Tallahassee.

523
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:06,878
Come on, Harrison.

524
00:26:22,361 --> 00:26:23,595
I'll check on Deb,

525
00:26:23,596 --> 00:26:25,663
and then I'll deal with Saxon.

526
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:40,111
This is the hospital.

527
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:42,613
I've done everything
you've asked.

528
00:26:42,614 --> 00:26:45,482
I just wanna go home.

529
00:26:45,483 --> 00:26:48,119
So this is it?

530
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,820
I promise.

531
00:26:49,821 --> 00:26:51,921
I don't say a word to anyone.

532
00:26:51,922 --> 00:26:53,522
No, I know.

533
00:27:04,168 --> 00:27:06,136
We need a doctor over her!

534
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:18,446
He's choking.
I need a suction canister.

535
00:27:18,447 --> 00:27:19,882
Right away.

536
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:28,389
Doctor?

537
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,824
Jesus.

538
00:27:29,825 --> 00:27:30,892
His tongue.
It's been cut out.

539
00:27:30,893 --> 00:27:32,626
Let's get him to the O.R.

540
00:27:32,627 --> 00:27:37,731
My God, why would anyone
cut his tongue out?

541
00:27:37,732 --> 00:27:39,733
All eyes on the victim.

542
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:42,068
The perfect distraction.

543
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:43,069
Saxon.

544
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:52,012
At this time, ask all visitors

545
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:53,213
to make their way
towards the exit

546
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:54,647
in the north wing.

547
00:27:54,648 --> 00:27:58,017
All surgical staff report
to their current assignments.

548
00:28:21,707 --> 00:28:22,707
Drop it.

549
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:25,009
Drop it.

550
00:28:29,747 --> 00:28:31,915
We got this, Dex.

551
00:28:54,204 --> 00:28:56,906
Quinn?

552
00:28:56,907 --> 00:28:58,140
Dex, I...

553
00:28:59,142 --> 00:29:01,176
Where's Deb?

554
00:29:01,177 --> 00:29:02,710
I don't know.
Something went wrong.

555
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:05,046
There was a...problem,

556
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:08,648
and they rushed her to the ICU.

557
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:09,884
What happened?

558
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:12,052
They're working on her now.

559
00:29:12,053 --> 00:29:16,190
Um...sh-she stopped
breathing.

560
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:30,370
Mr. Morgan, I'm afraid
I don't have good news.

561
00:29:30,371 --> 00:29:34,640
There were complications.

562
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:37,143
What kind of complications?

563
00:29:37,144 --> 00:29:39,111
We think a clot formed
during surgery

564
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:41,280
that triggered a major stroke.

565
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,681
Debra's brain was deprived
of oxygen for a period of time.

566
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:44,849
What do you mean?

567
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,251
I thought you said
she was gonna be fine.

568
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:48,553
I had hoped so.

569
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:50,255
I'm very sorry.

570
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,493
Is she going to recover?

571
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,796
It's possible that
she could breathe on her own,

572
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,465
but she won't be able to eat
without a feeding tube,

573
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,034
and, according
to the brain scans,

574
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:06,570
she won't be able
to think, reason,

575
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,373
or even know that you're there.

576
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:12,608
Now, uh, we've intubated her,

577
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:14,710
and I've lowered
her body temperature

578
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:17,047
so that we can preserve
as much brain function

579
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,614
as possible.

580
00:30:18,615 --> 00:30:20,716
You don't know Deb.

581
00:30:20,717 --> 00:30:23,486
She'll, uh--
she'll pull through this.

582
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:26,688
You hear about miracles
all the time.

583
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:28,390
Well, that's just it,
I'm afraid.

584
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:31,626
It would be a miracle.

585
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:37,732
I've never seen a miracle.

586
00:30:41,204 --> 00:30:44,638
Hello, Harrison.

587
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:47,875
Ohh.

588
00:30:47,876 --> 00:30:50,078
He's so fuckin' small.

589
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:57,952
I'll have to watch what I say
around you, little man.

590
00:31:00,054 --> 00:31:03,290
Don't you want
to hold your son?

591
00:31:05,126 --> 00:31:07,327
You won't break him.

592
00:31:07,328 --> 00:31:08,728
Okay.

593
00:31:15,102 --> 00:31:16,668
Talk to him.

594
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,908
Hello, Harrison.

595
00:31:25,112 --> 00:31:26,812
See? He knows you.

596
00:31:29,682 --> 00:31:31,216
I don't know how to do this.

597
00:31:31,217 --> 00:31:32,683
Just keep his head up.

598
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:35,120
No, I mean everything.

599
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:37,422
How to be a father,
how to take care of him.

600
00:31:37,423 --> 00:31:38,789
You'll be great.

601
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,358
How do you know?

602
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:42,093
'Cause you've always
taken care of me.

603
00:31:42,094 --> 00:31:44,595
I have?

604
00:31:44,596 --> 00:31:47,498
Ever since we were little.

605
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:48,932
Don't you remember
the monsters?

606
00:31:51,102 --> 00:31:52,269
Uh, no.

607
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,904
Every time mom would
turn off the lights,

608
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:55,772
they'd be running
all over the walls.

609
00:31:55,773 --> 00:31:57,541
And I couldn't fuckin'
go to sleep

610
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,676
'cause I thought they were gonna
eat me or something.

611
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:01,745
I don't remember.

612
00:32:01,746 --> 00:32:04,347
They were the shadows.

613
00:32:04,348 --> 00:32:07,017
You came in and explained it
in your dorky little voice.

614
00:32:07,018 --> 00:32:09,485
You were like, "Oh, it's just
the absence of light, Deb."

615
00:32:11,956 --> 00:32:13,623
I don't even know
why I remember that,

616
00:32:13,624 --> 00:32:15,091
but I do.

617
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:19,728
And even then,
you stayed in my room

618
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,098
and slept on the floor
by my bed.

619
00:32:24,168 --> 00:32:26,302
You made me feel
so fuckin' safe.

620
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:29,805
You were always
taking care of me.

621
00:32:29,806 --> 00:32:31,174
I know you're gonna
be a great father,

622
00:32:31,175 --> 00:32:33,909
because you've always been
a great big brother.

623
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,644
You really believe that?

624
00:32:36,645 --> 00:32:38,547
With all my heart.

625
00:32:47,656 --> 00:32:49,824
You were so wrong, Deb.

626
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:02,869
Tell me about Argentina.

627
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,238
Well, uh...

628
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:07,373
they have their own special
kind of cowboys.

629
00:33:07,374 --> 00:33:10,577
They're called gauchos.
Maybe you'll get to meet one.

630
00:33:10,578 --> 00:33:13,246
You know what else they have?

631
00:33:13,247 --> 00:33:14,547
Penguins.

632
00:33:14,548 --> 00:33:15,715
I like penguins.

633
00:33:15,716 --> 00:33:17,250
But not just in a zoo,

634
00:33:17,251 --> 00:33:19,952
they're wild ones,
kind of roaming around.

635
00:33:19,953 --> 00:33:24,889
'Cause Argentina is close
to the South Pole,

636
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:28,627
which is where Santa Claus
has his summer home, and...

637
00:33:31,297 --> 00:33:33,599
and...because
he's on vacation,

638
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,234
he's always in a good mood.

639
00:33:35,235 --> 00:33:37,969
So he says yes to everything.

640
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:41,672
Who knew you'd be
so good with kids, huh?

641
00:33:41,673 --> 00:33:43,307
How did you find me?

642
00:33:43,308 --> 00:33:46,977
One of my contacts
finally came through.

643
00:33:46,978 --> 00:33:49,013
Look, let's be civil
about this, all right?

644
00:33:49,014 --> 00:33:51,382
No need to upset Harrison.

645
00:33:51,383 --> 00:33:53,251
All right, everyone,
please take your seats.

646
00:33:53,252 --> 00:33:54,685
We're going out now.

647
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:55,918
Next stop, Daytona.

648
00:33:58,222 --> 00:34:01,291
So this is what's gonna happen.

649
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:03,527
We're gonna sit here quietly
until we get to Daytona.

650
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:06,863
Then we're gonna very calmly
get off the bus.

651
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:09,299
I'm gonna drive us
to the marshal's field office.

652
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,933
I'm gonna turn you in,
and I'm gonna hand Harrison

653
00:34:10,934 --> 00:34:14,703
over to Child
Protective Services.

654
00:34:14,704 --> 00:34:16,639
And I'm gonna collect
what's turning out to be

655
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,677
a very hard-earned reward.

656
00:34:30,352 --> 00:34:34,589
Dex, we're gonna nail
this asshole to the wall.

657
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:38,459
I promise you...
for Deb.

658
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:45,765
Oliver Saxon.

659
00:34:45,766 --> 00:34:48,101
Or would you prefer to be
called by your given name,

660
00:34:48,102 --> 00:34:50,304
Daniel Vogel?

661
00:34:51,939 --> 00:34:54,441
You know, there are several
ways we can do this.

662
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:57,311
Given that we have footage
of you killing other people,

663
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:58,378
it would be
in your best interest

664
00:34:58,379 --> 00:35:00,213
to cooperate.

665
00:35:00,214 --> 00:35:02,114
It's up to my lawyer
how cooperative I am.

666
00:35:02,115 --> 00:35:03,115
Are you sure?

667
00:35:03,116 --> 00:35:04,817
Because if you have any hope

668
00:35:04,818 --> 00:35:06,285
of staying out
of the electric chair,

669
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:08,354
you should probably
start talking.

670
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:09,822
Just fuckin' admit it.

671
00:35:09,823 --> 00:35:13,058
You killed Cassie,
you killed Clayton.

672
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:14,393
And you shot Deb.

673
00:35:16,362 --> 00:35:18,296
How did you hurt your arm?

674
00:35:18,297 --> 00:35:20,632
This?
It's just a scratch.

675
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:23,768
No.

676
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:26,671
Deb's a good shot.

677
00:35:26,672 --> 00:35:30,242
Who's Deb?

678
00:35:30,243 --> 00:35:32,376
Fuck you! You--
you fuckin' shot her!

679
00:35:32,377 --> 00:35:33,977
And you left her there to die!

680
00:35:33,978 --> 00:35:35,646
Just like you killed
your own mother,

681
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:38,148
and you left her to die,
you fuckin' piece of shit!

682
00:35:38,149 --> 00:35:39,683
Quinn. Out.

683
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:46,857
I'd like to, uh,
speak to my attorney, please.

684
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,235
You know, he was right
about one thing.

685
00:36:00,638 --> 00:36:02,972
You <i>are</i> a fuckin' piece
of shit.

686
00:36:04,474 --> 00:36:08,744
Batista and Quinn will be able
to make a case against Saxon.

687
00:36:08,745 --> 00:36:11,513
I could leave now for Argentina

688
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:15,183
and let the State of Florida
kill him.

689
00:36:15,184 --> 00:36:17,653
Folks, we will be arriving
at the Daytona station

690
00:36:17,654 --> 00:36:19,053
momentarily.

691
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:20,854
After a short stop,
we will proceed on

692
00:36:20,855 --> 00:36:22,189
to Tallahassee.

693
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,558
Anyone making a connection
to Jacksonville

694
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:26,327
should disembark and proceed

695
00:36:26,328 --> 00:36:28,296
to boarding bay three.

696
00:36:28,297 --> 00:36:29,530
Hey, hey.

697
00:36:29,531 --> 00:36:31,131
I'm just getting some tea.

698
00:36:44,812 --> 00:36:47,547
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you want some?

699
00:36:50,884 --> 00:36:52,651
How stupid do you think I am?

700
00:36:57,957 --> 00:36:59,425
Here's what's gonna happen.

701
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:01,393
The horse tranquilizer
I just gave you

702
00:37:01,394 --> 00:37:03,495
is gonna kick in
in about eight seconds.

703
00:37:03,496 --> 00:37:05,263
You're gonna asleep
for a couple of hours

704
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,865
and wake up in Tallahassee
with a slight headache,

705
00:37:06,866 --> 00:37:09,266
feeling humiliated and cranky.

706
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:13,471
Come on, sweetie.

707
00:37:13,472 --> 00:37:15,340
It's time to go.
Let's go.

708
00:37:15,341 --> 00:37:17,208
Come on.

709
00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:30,253
Hi, I'm here to do a GSR test

710
00:37:30,254 --> 00:37:32,021
on...Oliver Saxon?

711
00:37:32,022 --> 00:37:33,923
Sign in, please.

712
00:37:38,696 --> 00:37:40,363
Would you like
an officer with you?

713
00:37:40,364 --> 00:37:42,264
No, I'm good.

714
00:37:42,265 --> 00:37:44,099
Hit this button if you need us.

715
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,134
Got it.

716
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:35,481
I wish I could
blame you for everything.

717
00:38:37,551 --> 00:38:42,121
For what you did to my sister.

718
00:38:42,122 --> 00:38:44,489
But I know it's all my fault.

719
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,361
Should have walked away.

720
00:38:52,632 --> 00:38:55,366
You know, what you've actually
done is opened my eyes.

721
00:38:57,637 --> 00:39:01,539
Forced me to look at myself.

722
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,206
And what do you see?

723
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:10,713
A trail of blood
and body parts.

724
00:39:10,714 --> 00:39:13,115
What a pretty picture.

725
00:39:17,721 --> 00:39:19,489
In one, sharp moment

726
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,024
you took away this...

727
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:25,220
foolish dream that I could
have a happy life.

728
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,030
Is that why you're here?

729
00:39:29,031 --> 00:39:30,766
Tell me all this?

730
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:33,535
No, I'm here to kill you
with that pen.

731
00:40:14,641 --> 00:40:15,941
You all right?

732
00:40:19,913 --> 00:40:23,516
He tried to kill me.

733
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:53,176
Dexter.

734
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:54,310
Help me out here.

735
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:56,312
What--what were you doing
with Saxon?

736
00:40:56,313 --> 00:40:59,015
I went in to do a GSR test.

737
00:40:59,016 --> 00:41:00,583
But you don't even
work here anymore.

738
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:02,652
How are we gonna
to explain this?

739
00:41:02,653 --> 00:41:05,755
I'm officially here
till the end of the week.

740
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:10,092
Okay, but why would you
personally do this test?

741
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:12,327
After what he did to Deb...

742
00:41:12,328 --> 00:41:14,229
It's exactly because
of what he did to Deb

743
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,964
that I went in there.

744
00:41:15,965 --> 00:41:18,199
I wanted to make sure everything
was handled perfectly--

745
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,101
by the book, no mistakes.

746
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:27,676
And I wanted to look him
in the eye.

747
00:41:35,483 --> 00:41:37,451
Okay.

748
00:41:37,452 --> 00:41:39,019
I get that.

749
00:41:40,221 --> 00:41:42,656
It's obviously
self-defense.

750
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:49,095
Yeah.

751
00:41:49,096 --> 00:41:50,997
We got everything we need.

752
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:55,267
I'm glad he's dead.

753
00:41:55,268 --> 00:41:57,604
Wish I could have
done it myself.

754
00:42:05,745 --> 00:42:06,979
You should go, Dex.

755
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,680
I know that you have
a lot to deal with.

756
00:42:12,518 --> 00:42:14,786
Yes.

757
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:18,590
Hey...

758
00:42:21,493 --> 00:42:23,828
I'm praying for her.

759
00:42:34,305 --> 00:42:37,007
As much as I may have
pretended otherwise,

760
00:42:37,008 --> 00:42:38,742
for so long, all I wanted

761
00:42:38,743 --> 00:42:41,144
was to be like other people.

762
00:42:41,145 --> 00:42:42,912
To feel what they felt.

763
00:42:46,017 --> 00:42:48,985
But now that I do,
I just want it to stop.

764
00:43:24,418 --> 00:43:26,019
Attention all staff

765
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,222
and hospital personnel,
the National Hurricane Center...

766
00:43:29,223 --> 00:43:31,191
Uh, sir...
just so you know,

767
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,693
all patients in the south wing
are being moved.

768
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,928
We have to consolidate
space and power.

769
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:36,997
At 150 miles per hour.

770
00:43:36,998 --> 00:43:40,332
It has been elevated
to category 3.

771
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:42,534
At this time,
all staff must report

772
00:43:42,535 --> 00:43:44,203
to their preassigned station.

773
00:44:07,626 --> 00:44:10,861
I would change everything
if I could.

774
00:44:19,771 --> 00:44:21,238
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

775
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:23,006
I'm sorry.

776
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:39,155
But I can't
leave you like this.

777
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,194
I'm your big brother.

778
00:46:18,615 --> 00:46:20,883
I love you, Deb.

779
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,582
- Dexter.
- Hey, where are you?

780
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:43,149
At the airport, about to board.

781
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:44,384
We're gonna make it.

782
00:48:44,385 --> 00:48:46,552
That's great.

783
00:48:46,553 --> 00:48:48,488
Where are you?

784
00:48:48,489 --> 00:48:50,590
I'm still in Miami.

785
00:48:50,591 --> 00:48:52,892
But I'm gonna be leaving soon.

786
00:48:52,893 --> 00:48:54,560
I can't believe
this is actually gonna happen.

787
00:48:54,561 --> 00:48:55,795
You know, I think,
once we get there,

788
00:48:55,796 --> 00:48:57,364
we should start
making our way south.

789
00:48:57,365 --> 00:48:59,564
They have 3,000 miles
of coastline.

790
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:00,866
We can just keep going

791
00:49:00,867 --> 00:49:02,634
until we find the perfect spot,

792
00:49:02,635 --> 00:49:05,304
or maybe some penguins.

793
00:49:05,305 --> 00:49:06,771
That sounds great.

794
00:49:06,772 --> 00:49:09,974
I am so happy right now, Dex.

795
00:49:12,744 --> 00:49:13,878
Me too.

796
00:49:13,879 --> 00:49:15,713
Do you wanna talk to Harrison?

797
00:49:15,714 --> 00:49:18,149
Please.

798
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,517
Okay, here.

799
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,721
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Harrison.

800
00:49:24,722 --> 00:49:25,955
I just want to tell you
one last time

801
00:49:25,956 --> 00:49:27,824
that I love you.

802
00:49:27,825 --> 00:49:29,226
I love you too.

803
00:49:29,227 --> 00:49:32,195
I want you to remember that
every single day

804
00:49:32,196 --> 00:49:33,463
until I see you again.

805
00:49:33,464 --> 00:49:34,931
Daddy loves you.

806
00:49:34,932 --> 00:49:36,199
Okay.

807
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,667
Bye.

808
00:51:32,275 --> 00:51:36,011
I destroy everyone I love.

809
00:51:36,012 --> 00:51:38,780
And I can't let that happen
to Hannah,

810
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:40,415
to Harrison.

811
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:44,686
I have to protect them from me.

812
00:51:59,668 --> 00:52:00,934
Good morning, Miami.

813
00:52:00,935 --> 00:52:02,370
Hurricane Laura has passed

814
00:52:02,371 --> 00:52:04,070
and everything is going
back to normal.

815
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:06,139
There is no longer any threat.

816
00:52:07,408 --> 00:52:09,209
Hurricane Laura
is slowly dissipating

817
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,110
over the Atlantic.
She is heading south...

818
00:52:11,111 --> 00:52:12,879
The majority of destruction
is along the harbor.

819
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,747
There have been some reports...

820
00:52:14,748 --> 00:52:17,050
The cleanup has begun
as the city returns to normal

821
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,918
with coast guard teams going
as far north as Daytona Beach

822
00:52:19,919 --> 00:52:21,820
- and as far south...
- Cutter 6, go ahead

823
00:52:21,821 --> 00:52:23,489
and turn to your 1:00.

824
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,424
There's something there.
I can't make it out.

825
00:52:25,425 --> 00:52:26,692
Give me a time.

826
00:52:26,693 --> 00:52:28,160
Stopping in five seconds.

827
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:30,729
- Okay, I think we got a visual.
- Copy that.

828
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,764
Turning northwest.

829
00:52:35,334 --> 00:52:37,068
We've surveyed the wreckage.

830
00:52:37,069 --> 00:52:39,704
There doesn't appear
to be any survivors.

831
00:52:39,705 --> 00:52:42,006
We're heading back.

832
00:52:46,345 --> 00:52:47,645
Batista.

833
00:52:47,646 --> 00:52:49,247
This is
the U.S. Coast Guard.

834
00:52:49,248 --> 00:52:51,215
We just wanted to call
and report the wreckage

835
00:52:51,216 --> 00:52:52,816
of Dexter Morgan's boat.

836
00:52:52,817 --> 00:52:54,718
Dexter?

837
00:53:28,885 --> 00:53:31,353
Hey, uh, how about we go
get some ice cream, yeah?

838
00:53:31,354 --> 00:53:33,564
- Okay.
- Yeah. Come on.

839
00:55:19,008 --> 00:55:29,461
