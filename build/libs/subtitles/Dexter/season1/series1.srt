1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,400
<i>Tonight's the night.

2
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,133
<i>And it's going to happen
again and again --

3
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:38,000
<i>has to happen.

4
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:44,934
<i>Nice night.

5
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:49,776
<i>Miami is a great town.
I love the Cuban food.

6
00:00:50,077 --> 00:00:53,601
<i>Pork sandwiches -- my favorite.

7
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:03,634
<i>But I'm hungry for
something different now.

8
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,567
<i>There he is -- Mike Donovan.

9
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,002
<i>He's the one.

10
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,506
You're mine now,
so do exactly as I say.

11
00:02:06,903 --> 00:02:09,604
- What do you want?
- I want you to be quiet.

12
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:11,805
Now drive.

13
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,862
Turn here.

14
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,611
You have to listen...

15
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:16,070
...Do what I say.

16
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:29,871
- Look.
- No.

17
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:31,451
Uh, yes.

18
00:03:33,457 --> 00:03:34,893
No, no!

19
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:37,390
It's horrible, isn't it?
Isn't it?

20
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,130
Please...

21
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:44,063
Open your eyes and
look at what you did!

22
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:48,033
Look or I'll cut your
eyelids right off your face.

23
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:57,663
It took me a long time to
get these little boys clean.

24
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:01,992
One of them had been in the ground
so long he was falling apart.

25
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:04,222
I pulled him out
in bits and pieces.

26
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:06,800
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is --

27
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:09,212
Stop! That never
helped anybody.

28
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:15,063
Please, you can have anything.

29
00:04:15,107 --> 00:04:18,063
That's good. Beg.
Did these little boys beg?

30
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:26,982
I couldn't help myself.
I couldn't. I--

31
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:29,861
Please, you have to understand...

32
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:35,242
Trust me, I definitely understand.

33
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:38,282
See, I can't help myself, either.

34
00:04:40,606 --> 00:04:43,452
Children, I could never do that.
Not like you.

35
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:46,763
Never, ever kids.

36
00:04:47,465 --> 00:04:49,053
Why?

37
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,600
I have standards.

38
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:21,810
Soon you'll be packed
into a few...

39
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:27,172
...neatly wrapped hefties

40
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:33,031
in my own small
corner of the world.

41
00:05:34,138 --> 00:05:39,031
It'll be a neater,
happier place.

42
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:44,752
A better place.

43
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:10,833
<i>My name is Dexter,
Dexter Morgan.

44
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:12,652
<i>I don't know what
made me the way I am,

45
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:16,013
<i>but whatever it was left
a hollow place inside.

46
00:06:16,037 --> 00:06:19,552
<i>People fake a lot of human
interactions,

47
00:06:19,576 --> 00:06:22,840
<i>but I feel like I fake them all,
and I fake them very well.

48
00:06:22,858 --> 00:06:23,941
Ahoy!

49
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:27,970
Ahoy, there, captain!
Any big marlin out there today?

50
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:30,430
<i>And that's my burden, I guess.

51
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:33,132
<i>But I don't blame my
foster parents for that.

52
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:36,333
<i>Harry and Doris Morgan did
a wonderful job raising me.

53
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:39,631
<i>But they're both dead now.

54
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:42,470
<i>I didn't kill them...

55
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,882
<i>Honest.

56
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:47,291
You're different, aren't you, Dexter?

57
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:49,751
What do you mean, pop?

58
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:53,063
The Billups say
Buddy disappeared.

59
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:56,951
I found the grave, son.

60
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:59,132
That dog was a noisy
little creep, dad.

61
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:01,203
He was barking all night,
and mom couldn't sleep.

62
00:07:01,217 --> 00:07:03,793
And she's very, very sick,
and that lousy dog was yapping

63
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:05,982
at every leaf that blew
down the sidewalk!

64
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:08,291
There were a lot of
bones in there, Dexter,

65
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:10,820
and not just Buddy's.

66
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:30,693
Hola, Dexter!

67
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:12,162
<i>Blood--

68
00:08:12,845 --> 00:08:15,463
<i>sometimes it sets
my teeth on edge.

69
00:08:18,138 --> 00:08:20,952
<i>Other times,
it helps me control the chaos.

70
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:26,830
<i>The code of Harry,
my foster father, is satisfied.

71
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,490
<i>And so am I.

72
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:31,901
<i>Harry was a great
cop here in Miami.

73
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:35,403
<i>He taught me how to think like one,
taught me how to cover my tracks.

74
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:38,873
<i>I'm a very neat monster.

75
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:44,500
Dexter, are you there?

76
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:47,632
Okay, Dex, please,
as soon as you get in,

77
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:51,263
I'm at a crime scene by the
shithole the Seven Seas motel,

78
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:53,733
and I need you here.
Okay?

79
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:55,752
Dex?
Please...

80
00:08:55,757 --> 00:08:58,092
Pretty fucking please
with cheese on top.

81
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,411
<i>That's my foul-mouthed
foster sister, Debra.

82
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:04,163
<i>She has a big heart but
won't let anyone see it.

83
00:09:04,246 --> 00:09:06,472
<i>She's the only person in
the world who loves me.

84
00:09:06,738 --> 00:09:08,442
<i>I think that's nice.

85
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,202
<i>I don't have feelings
about anything,

86
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:13,163
<i>but if I could have feelings at all,
I'd have them for Deb.

87
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:20,501
<i>There's something
strange and disarming

88
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:23,563
<i>about looking at a homicide
scene in the daylight of Miami.

89
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:26,562
<i>It makes the most grotesque
killings look staged,

90
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,701
<i>like you're in a new and daring
section of Disney World --

91
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:31,541
<i>Dahmer Land*.

92
00:09:31,557 --> 00:09:32,822
You better be a cop.

93
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:34,243
No.
Forensics.

94
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:41,560
Dex!

95
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:44,901
Hey, what's up?

96
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,793
Jeez, Deb...

97
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:52,560
Where the hell do
you keep your gun?

98
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:54,451
They found another hooker,
in the pool.

99
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:56,573
- Another?
- Chopped up in bits and pieces.

100
00:09:56,607 --> 00:10:00,013
- That's the third one in 5 months.
- Third? You mean there's a --

101
00:10:00,056 --> 00:10:01,793
A serial killer, that's right.

102
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:03,553
The other 2 were in Broward,

103
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:05,441
chopped up just like this one.

104
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:07,071
Any suspects?

105
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:08,953
Wish I knew.

106
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:11,413
I'm on Vice,
so Laguerta sent me to my room

107
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:12,770
and told me to stay out of sight.

108
00:10:12,788 --> 00:10:15,392
God forbids she listens
to what you have to say.

109
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:16,990
Tell me about it.

110
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:19,730
How does someone so
dumb get so much power?

111
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:24,050
She knows how to play the game.
You could take a lesson.

112
00:10:24,268 --> 00:10:25,662
In what, ass-kissing?

113
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:27,223
Politics.

114
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:35,020
I just want to catch this guy before
he kills another one of my girls.

115
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,160
- You can't get so emotionally invested.
- You always say that.

116
00:10:38,195 --> 00:10:39,703
So did dad.

117
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:43,231
Yeah, but he also said,
"go after what you want."

118
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,641
I want out of Vice
and into Homicide.

119
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,012
What can I do to help?

120
00:10:49,938 --> 00:10:53,372
You get these hunches, you know,
with these types of murders.

121
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:57,763
- Only sometimes.
- Well, see if you get one this time.

122
00:10:57,968 --> 00:10:59,572
And can I bounce some
ideas off of you later?

123
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:01,501
You know I always get smarter
when I'm talking to you.

124
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,932
You just need a little
more confidence.

125
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,040
All right, I'll take a look.

126
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:14,880
In the meantime, avoid Laguerta
and talk to Captain Matthews.

127
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:17,342
He and dad were tight.
Maybe he'll put you on the case.

128
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:19,830
You're making me
smarter already, see?

129
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:22,701
And keep the sex suit on when
you talk to the Captain.

130
00:11:22,735 --> 00:11:24,213
It'll help your cause.

131
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:40,300
- That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.
- Saw your sister.

132
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:42,641
- Damn, looking hot.
- Yeah, she should.

133
00:11:42,698 --> 00:11:44,312
It's hot as hell out here.

134
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:47,091
So... Why are you here?

135
00:11:47,436 --> 00:11:49,440
- It's a crime scene.
- Yeah.

136
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:51,003
- But you do blood spatter.
- So?

137
00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:53,591
So?...
There's no blood here.

138
00:11:54,738 --> 00:11:58,411
- What was that?
- Yeah. There's no blood in or on

139
00:11:58,507 --> 00:12:02,251
or near the body at all.
It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

140
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:04,393
Hey, Angel, let's show him.

141
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:05,820
<i>No blood.

142
00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:10,200
<i>No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood.
No blood at all.

143
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,036
<i>Why hadn't I thought of that?
No blood.

144
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,164
<i>What a beautiful idea!

145
00:12:19,207 --> 00:12:21,205
How is he doing? How does the
killer get rid of the blood?

146
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:24,650
It's hard to say.
The body's in good shape.

147
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:27,182
She got a nice ass, too.

148
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:30,230
Head is over there,
if you want to take a look.

149
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:33,033
- This is unique.
- No shit.

150
00:12:33,396 --> 00:12:34,982
And no prints, either.

151
00:12:35,536 --> 00:12:40,660
<i>I've never seen such clean,
dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

152
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:41,753
<i>Wonderful.

153
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,450
Very clean.

154
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:46,312
Yeah, but he didn't finish.
No termin?.

155
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,610
- It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.
- No, no. Look.

156
00:12:49,737 --> 00:12:54,211
He cut the leg in four pieces,
almost like using a ruler.

157
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:57,791
But this leg is
in three pieces.

158
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:03,403
Now, look, he started to make
a fourth cut but stopped.

159
00:13:03,436 --> 00:13:06,331
- It's possible he got interrupted.
- Laguerta's looking for a witness,

160
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,101
working on the motel
porter back there.

161
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:09,332
God help him.

162
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:13,560
<i>No blood.

163
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:15,932
<i>I can't think.
I have to get out of here.

164
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:20,583
Dex, ?d?nde va?
Where are you going?

165
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:24,202
Hey, no blood...
No trabajo.

166
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:37,611
<i>I wish she'd stop that.
It's one of those mating rituals

167
00:13:37,706 --> 00:13:40,000
<i>which I really
don't understand.

168
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,431
<i>But that bloodless body --

169
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:52,960
<i>this guy may have exceeded
my own abilities.

170
00:13:58,107 --> 00:14:00,093
- Morning, Dex.
- Morning.

171
00:14:03,735 --> 00:14:06,931
- Hey, Dex.
- Hey, Sue. Dan.

172
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:12,230
- How are the families?
- Good. You?

173
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,813
- See you at the next bloodbath?
- Never miss a party.

174
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:17,703
Thanks.

175
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:23,453
<i>Salt of the earth, these people,
and they work hard.

176
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,503
<i>But with the solve rate
for murders at about 20%,

177
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:31,331
<i>Miami is a great place for me,
a great place for me to hone my craft.

178
00:14:31,436 --> 00:14:33,103
<i>Viva Miami.

179
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:34,762
Dex.

180
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:38,902
- I like your other outfit better.
- You're a sick bastard. Guess what.

181
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:41,202
Sex suit worked.
Captain put me on the case.

182
00:14:41,237 --> 00:14:44,403
Laguerta wasn't happy,
but she needs to get laid.

183
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:49,551
- I guess. So congrats!
- So you got any ideas yet?

184
00:14:49,575 --> 00:14:50,701
Nope.

185
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,770
Well, start working on
your mental autopsy

186
00:14:53,808 --> 00:14:57,002
'cause I could use your theories.
And thanks for the fucking doughnut.

187
00:14:57,038 --> 00:14:58,933
I got to go.

188
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:02,630
Doughnut?

189
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:08,602
You keeping your
fingernails clean?

190
00:15:08,637 --> 00:15:10,761
Never leave home without
my rubber gloves.

191
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:12,203
Good boy.

192
00:15:14,905 --> 00:15:16,833
So, anything new?

193
00:15:25,436 --> 00:15:27,130
One of these days
you're gonna tell me.

194
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:28,223
I already told you.

195
00:15:28,235 --> 00:15:30,341
Blood spatter doesn't
take up all my time.

196
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:33,963
I like doing it. Maybe I can help out.
It fills my nights.

197
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:38,000
- You have a morbid sense of fun.
- That's probably true.

198
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:43,330
- You should find a pretty girl.
- I found you.

199
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:48,603
Charming like your father.
Just don't get me fired.

200
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,443
Then who would I
bring doughnuts to?

201
00:15:56,338 --> 00:16:00,041
- Angel, ?una m?s?
- Gracias.

202
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:01,483
De nada.

203
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:05,820
<i>Just like me...

204
00:16:05,886 --> 00:16:07,802
<i>Empty inside.

205
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:23,730
- Where the hell you been?
- Crime scene.

206
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:25,731
What about these?

207
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:28,633
The hotel cokehead murders,
this dealer and the girl?

208
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:31,902
Well, this hallmark-looking couple

209
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:34,362
didn't die by the hands
of a professional.

210
00:16:35,365 --> 00:16:38,363
No, this is child's play.
Messy work --

211
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:40,972
All that blood on the walls
looks like a finger painting.

212
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:44,002
You give me the fucking creeps,
you know that, Dexter?

213
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:47,030
Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

214
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:51,462
- Fuck you.
- Okay.

215
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:53,303
Is there something I can do?

216
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:55,602
You can give me a fucking analysis
on the blood spatter on this killings.

217
00:16:55,635 --> 00:16:58,532
You think I'm here to invite
you to my nephew's bris?

218
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:00,603
I didn't know you were Jewish.

219
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:02,963
Shut the fuck up and
write your report already.

220
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:04,831
Don't even know why I need you.

221
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:07,013
Grab a crayon, psycho,
and scribble this down.

222
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:08,993
Rival dealer came in.
Two scumbags slashed to hell,

223
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,932
dealer stole the drugs.

224
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:14,232
Wham, bam, done.
And I don't give a shit what you say

225
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:16,770
because that's what happened
and that's who I'm looking for.

226
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:20,633
Hey, we are looking for a
motherfucking thief dealer.

227
00:17:20,668 --> 00:17:24,461
- You got it?
- Okay. Sure.

228
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:29,102
I guess.
But I should get over there.

229
00:17:29,505 --> 00:17:32,071
Then get over there already,
you fucking weirdo.

230
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:36,230
- I need it quick.
- I'm on it, sergeant.

231
00:17:39,867 --> 00:17:43,783
<i>The only real question I have is why,
in a building full of cops,

232
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:47,430
<i>all supposedly with a keen
insight into the human soul,

233
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:52,602
<i>is Doakes the only one who
gets the creeps from me?

234
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:58,142
- So this killer used a sword?
- No.

235
00:17:58,405 --> 00:18:01,493
Probably a very sharp knife.

236
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:05,331
Look at the blood spatter.
Look at the patterns.

237
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:06,762
It tells a story.

238
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:08,401
You see this big pond
of blood right there?

239
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:10,361
That's from the initial stab.

240
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:13,661
The male victim was
standing right here,

241
00:18:13,705 --> 00:18:16,630
and the killer plunged his
knife into the shoulder,

242
00:18:16,668 --> 00:18:19,000
severing the carotid artery,
and -- blpph

243
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:22,272
- Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?
- Yeah, nice.

244
00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:25,901
Now, over here, you have nice,
clean sprays of blood,

245
00:18:25,945 --> 00:18:27,663
that can only happen when
you're holding something light

246
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:30,721
and moving quick --
nice, sharp slices through the body.

247
00:18:30,737 --> 00:18:35,451
No splashes, no drips.
Clean and easy.

248
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:39,831
This guy knew how to use a blade.

249
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:43,370
So we're looking for a sushi chef.

250
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,330
Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

251
00:18:46,368 --> 00:18:50,263
Wouldn't be my first choice,
but, hey, you never know.

252
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:54,163
- Now what?
- Now I eat!

253
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,333
<i>The problem with
eating and driving,

254
00:18:56,365 --> 00:18:58,631
<i>which I love to do,
is not being able to employ

255
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,733
<i>the 10:00-2:00 hand
position on the wheel.

256
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:03,900
<i>It's a matter of public safety.

257
00:19:04,036 --> 00:19:07,740
<i>But there's always a sacrifice.

258
00:19:13,408 --> 00:19:17,830
<i>This guy, Jamie Jaworski.

259
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:21,231
<i>Six months ago, I think he fell
in love with a pretty brunette,

260
00:19:21,265 --> 00:19:23,503
<i>Mrs. Jane Saunders --

261
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,162
<i>A sweet mother of two married
to a successful banker --

262
00:19:27,205 --> 00:19:30,800
<i>All living a pleasant life until she,
unfortunately, disappeared,

263
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:34,861
<i>leaving the kids emotionally
devastated forever.

264
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,863
<i>The cops arrested
my favorite valet,

265
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:44,132
<i>but his lawyer got him off
on a faulty search warrant.

266
00:19:47,866 --> 00:19:50,703
<i>It's a good thing I
don't bother with them.

267
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:46,900
<i>Animals don't like me,
especially dogs.

268
00:20:46,937 --> 00:20:48,763
<i>I don't think they approve

269
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:51,731
<i>of what I sometimes
do to their masters.

270
00:20:51,765 --> 00:20:57,203
<i>That dog recognizes me as easily
as I can recognize Jaworski

271
00:20:57,237 --> 00:20:59,700
<i>or any other killer.

272
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:26,500
<i>Interesting taste
in literature.

273
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,831
<i>His needs are evolving,
turning violent.

274
00:21:29,866 --> 00:21:32,962
<i>He's on the fast track.

275
00:21:33,016 --> 00:21:36,101
Have you ever wanted
to kill anything else?

276
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:39,560
You know,
something bigger than a dog?

277
00:21:41,606 --> 00:21:46,231
- Yes.
- Like a person?

278
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:49,061
Yeah, but no one in particular.

279
00:21:51,237 --> 00:21:53,561
Why didn't you?

280
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:58,431
I thought you and
mom wouldn't like it.

281
00:22:07,937 --> 00:22:09,860
Come here.

282
00:22:18,356 --> 00:22:21,700
<i>Friday night.
Date night in Miami.

283
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:24,202
<i>Every night is
a date night in Miami,

284
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:27,001
<i>and everyone's having sex.

285
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:30,093
<i>But for me, sex never
enters into it.

286
00:22:30,095 --> 00:22:32,003
<i>I don't understand sex.

287
00:22:32,707 --> 00:22:35,110
<i>Not that I have
anything against women,

288
00:22:35,217 --> 00:22:37,400
<i>and I certainly have an
appropriate sensibility about men,

289
00:22:37,427 --> 00:22:41,071
<i>but when it comes to
the actual act of sex,

290
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:44,413
<i>it's always just seemed so...

291
00:22:45,355 --> 00:22:47,401
<i>undignified.

292
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:50,361
<i>But I have to play the game.

293
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:52,763
<i>And after years of
trying to look normal,

294
00:22:52,796 --> 00:22:55,360
<i>I think I met the
right woman for me.

295
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,702
<i>Deb saved her life on a
domestic-dispute call,

296
00:22:58,737 --> 00:23:00,203
<i>introduced us,

297
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:02,980
<i>and we've been dating
for six months now.

298
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:08,600
<i>She's perfect because Rita is,
in her own way, as damaged as me.

299
00:23:09,265 --> 00:23:11,001
I'm running late.
I'll just be a sec.

300
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:14,651
- I have to change.
- Okeydoke.

301
00:23:21,006 --> 00:23:22,531
Hi, Dexter.

302
00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:25,531
May I say that you look
lovely this evening?

303
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,333
Okay.

304
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:32,101
Master Cody, handsome as ever.
High five.

305
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:41,733
Do the space shuttle.

306
00:23:44,237 --> 00:23:49,560
Vanilla... Chocolate,
and strawberry.

307
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:53,002
- No coffee?
- Which one do you think melts faster?

308
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:55,760
Ready?

309
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:59,021
<i>Rita's ex-hubby,
the crack addict,

310
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:03,032
<i>repeatedly raped her,
knocked her around.

311
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:07,961
<i>Ever since then, she's been
completely uninterested in sex.

312
00:24:09,036 --> 00:24:11,093
<i>That works for me.

313
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:13,483
Will you be back?

314
00:24:13,507 --> 00:24:16,501
- Of course I'll be back.
- I meant Dexter.

315
00:24:16,837 --> 00:24:19,520
- You'll be asleep.
- No, I won't.

316
00:24:19,766 --> 00:24:21,300
Then I'll stop in and
we'll all play cards.

317
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:22,760
Texas Hold 'em?

318
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:26,962
Give mommy a kiss.

319
00:24:28,238 --> 00:24:30,901
- Ready?
- Yeah.

320
00:24:43,435 --> 00:24:46,403
<i>Needless to say,
I have some unusual habits,

321
00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:48,403
<i>yet all these socially
acceptable people

322
00:24:48,437 --> 00:24:51,882
<i>can't wait to pick up hammers and
publicly smash their food to bits.

323
00:24:54,237 --> 00:25:00,131
<i>Normal people are so hostile...
But not her.

324
00:25:20,837 --> 00:25:22,601
Where are we going?

325
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:25,860
They might need me.

326
00:25:29,766 --> 00:25:32,801
Just stay right there.
I'll be right back.

327
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:58,932
- Son of a whore.
- Who?

328
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:01,662
Talking about this hijo de puta,
this asshole killer,

329
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:04,783
this maric?n savage who makes
us work on a Friday night.

330
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:08,263
Only Mondays through Thursdays --
that's what I always say.

331
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:12,712
Of course, co?o, be reasonable.
Who wants to work on a Friday night?

332
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:14,830
I have my needs.

333
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,503
So, ?c?mo est?s?
What are you doing here?

334
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:22,261
I was in the neighborhood.
I'm on a date.

335
00:26:22,306 --> 00:26:26,361
- A date? Nice.
- Same guy, same pattern.

336
00:26:26,406 --> 00:26:31,333
Bone dry. No blood again.
Pero mira esto.

337
00:26:31,368 --> 00:26:33,802
There's some small differences
in the cuts this time.

338
00:26:33,838 --> 00:26:37,460
Over here -- rough,
almost emotion.

339
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:40,530
Then over here,
not so much.

340
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:44,452
- And then over here -- clean.
- Muy bien.

341
00:26:44,665 --> 00:26:47,102
Yeah, nice.
But look at this.

342
00:26:48,336 --> 00:26:49,760
All bone.

343
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:53,661
The killer flayed the skin,
the flesh, completely off.

344
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:57,052
- Now, why would he do that?
- He's experimenting.

345
00:26:57,136 --> 00:26:58,730
He's trying to
find the right way.

346
00:26:58,766 --> 00:27:01,961
Is he experimenting
with the head, too?

347
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:03,500
What do you mean?

348
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:06,262
La bestia left her tits
and took her fucking head.

349
00:27:06,306 --> 00:27:08,700
I don't find anyone
around here.

350
00:27:08,736 --> 00:27:10,470
And God only knows what
he's doing with it.

351
00:27:10,508 --> 00:27:13,403
<i>He's certainly
raising the bar. Damn!

352
00:27:13,835 --> 00:27:15,960
<i>This guy is good.

353
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:21,901
- Will they catch him soon?
- I doubt it.

354
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:26,961
The killer is an artist.

355
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:30,440
What do you mean?

356
00:27:31,305 --> 00:27:34,333
His technique...

357
00:27:35,508 --> 00:27:36,962
is incredible.

358
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:46,711
I'm sorry.
I don't think I want to.

359
00:27:47,346 --> 00:27:51,262
I mean, I'm --
I'm not ready.

360
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:55,003
Damn it, Dexter.

361
00:27:55,746 --> 00:27:58,391
<i>What have I done now?

362
00:27:59,806 --> 00:28:03,671
<i>And why can't I get that neat stack
of body parts out of my head?

363
00:28:04,468 --> 00:28:07,161
<i>No blood.

364
00:28:07,805 --> 00:28:11,543
Why did I touch her that way?

365
00:28:12,218 --> 00:28:14,750
<i>I need to get back to my work.

366
00:28:16,865 --> 00:28:20,262
<i>Jaworski's website,
"scream-bitch-scream" --

367
00:28:20,306 --> 00:28:23,530
<i>the mother of all rape sites.

368
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:42,260
<i>That's it.
He's definitely the one.

369
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:45,681
<i>Now it's just a matter of time

370
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:49,910
<i>before he becomes a drop of blood
in my glass-slide collection.

371
00:28:50,808 --> 00:28:52,600
<i>But I have to wait.

372
00:28:52,637 --> 00:28:55,400
<i>I have to be careful

373
00:28:55,506 --> 00:28:57,960
<i>and follow the code of Harry.

374
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:10,260
Hey, dad.

375
00:29:14,136 --> 00:29:16,480
- I can explain.
- You and I had an understanding.

376
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:19,362
Whenever you get an urge,
you come to me,

377
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:21,252
you tell me,
and we deal with it together.

378
00:29:21,297 --> 00:29:23,552
- I do tell you, dad.
- The hell you do!

379
00:29:23,635 --> 00:29:27,820
- There's blood on this knife.
- Animals. I find animals, that's all.

380
00:29:27,857 --> 00:29:30,471
Are you sure?
Are you telling me the truth?

381
00:29:30,537 --> 00:29:32,082
Yes!

382
00:29:32,285 --> 00:29:34,831
I thought we had
this under control.

383
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:46,331
You still don't remember
anything from before,

384
00:29:46,366 --> 00:29:49,762
- you know, before we took you in?
- No.

385
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:54,231
Is that why I have these urges?

386
00:29:57,005 --> 00:30:00,270
What happened changed
something inside you.

387
00:30:00,536 --> 00:30:03,761
It got into you too early.

388
00:30:04,305 --> 00:30:07,400
I'm afraid your urge to kill
is only gonna get stronger.

389
00:30:07,437 --> 00:30:10,203
You're saying I'll be
like this forever.

390
00:30:11,668 --> 00:30:15,303
You're a good kid, Dex.
You are.

391
00:30:16,436 --> 00:30:19,570
Otherwise, it would have been
a lot worse than animals.

392
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:25,161
Okay?
We can't stop this.

393
00:30:26,265 --> 00:30:27,761
But maybe...

394
00:30:29,935 --> 00:30:34,602
We can do something
to channel it.

395
00:30:36,516 --> 00:30:40,522
- Use it for good.
- How could it ever be good?

396
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:43,730
Son, there are people out
there who do really bad things.

397
00:30:44,585 --> 00:30:50,132
Terrible people.
And the police can't catch them all.

398
00:30:53,337 --> 00:30:57,321
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

399
00:30:57,427 --> 00:31:01,302
You're saying
they deserve it.

400
00:31:01,325 --> 00:31:03,701
That's right.

401
00:31:04,338 --> 00:31:07,293
But, of course,
you have to learn how to spot them,

402
00:31:08,928 --> 00:31:12,111
how to cover your tracks.

403
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:15,003
But I can teach you.

404
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:19,903
- Dad...
- It's okay, Dex.

405
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:25,461
You can't help what happened to you,
but you can make the best of it.

406
00:31:25,507 --> 00:31:30,462
Remember this forever --
you are my son,

407
00:31:30,507 --> 00:31:34,162
you are not alone,
and you are loved.

408
00:31:36,515 --> 00:31:38,652
Okay.

409
00:31:39,475 --> 00:31:42,033
<i>Preparation is vital.

410
00:31:42,056 --> 00:31:44,602
<i>No detail can be overlooked.

411
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:52,831
<i>And the ritual is intoxicating.

412
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:04,033
<i>Duct tape...

413
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,450
<i>Rubber sheets...

414
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:10,632
<i>Necessary tools of the trade.

415
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,503
You can't bullshit me, Dex.
Help me out.

416
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,702
Laguerta has me
interviewing hookers.

417
00:32:19,715 --> 00:32:22,081
It's a waste of time.

418
00:32:22,665 --> 00:32:27,642
Deb, if he was
interrupted... Think.

419
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:30,581
Jesus Christ, right.

420
00:32:30,597 --> 00:32:33,351
Because then how do you have
time to wrap all the pieces?

421
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:36,443
She's dumber than the boat people.
Throw her a fucking raft.

422
00:32:36,508 --> 00:32:39,473
But now we have a fourth body,
and the cuts were different.

423
00:32:39,578 --> 00:32:42,881
And that's telling us a story.
The ritual is changing.

424
00:32:44,507 --> 00:32:47,301
He's looking for some kind of
inspiration and not finding it.

425
00:32:47,338 --> 00:32:49,401
So he keeps doing it
until he gets it right.

426
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:51,062
I could be wrong.

427
00:32:52,808 --> 00:32:55,733
So how the hell was your
date with Rita last night?

428
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,003
Great.

429
00:32:57,036 --> 00:32:58,973
You should try it sometime.
You need a life.

430
00:32:59,007 --> 00:33:03,251
Well, find me a guy I can trust.
I need a transfer to Homicide, bro,

431
00:33:03,308 --> 00:33:04,820
then we'll see about a life.

432
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:05,960
I understand that.

433
00:33:05,988 --> 00:33:07,602
It certainly would sound
better for the kids to say,

434
00:33:07,617 --> 00:33:09,252
"mommy's on Homicide."

435
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,701
- Don't make me hit you.
- Come on.

436
00:33:13,406 --> 00:33:16,260
Then we could talk about more
little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

437
00:33:16,306 --> 00:33:19,913
- What's wrong with that?
- You sound like mom.

438
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:24,300
I just -- tell me what you know
about cell crystallization.

439
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:27,183
- What do you mean?
- I heard the coroner say it last night.

440
00:33:27,316 --> 00:33:30,841
He was talking about
that dead... headless chick.

441
00:33:30,945 --> 00:33:34,991
- You got that look in your eye.
- I was there before you,

442
00:33:35,095 --> 00:33:38,802
and I noticed this body looked
different than the other ones.

443
00:33:39,257 --> 00:33:41,182
The pieces were cold.

444
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:44,232
But meat-packing cold.

445
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:47,001
Is that what cell
crystallization means?

446
00:33:47,036 --> 00:33:50,312
<i>My god, why didn't I think of that?
It's beautiful.

447
00:33:50,318 --> 00:33:53,863
Dex.
What are you thinking?

448
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:57,760
Sorry.
That makes sense.

449
00:33:57,807 --> 00:33:59,660
Cold.

450
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:04,202
It slows the flow of blood.

451
00:34:04,478 --> 00:34:07,201
Why the hell is that important?

452
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:11,411
- It's just a feeling.
- That's not good enough.

453
00:34:12,205 --> 00:34:15,831
I got to show Laguerta and her boys.
They're making fun of me.

454
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,532
They're saying the only way
I can close a case is on my back.

455
00:34:20,097 --> 00:34:24,530
I got to get out of Vice.
Dex, please, you got to --

456
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,230
Refrigerated truck.

457
00:34:28,036 --> 00:34:30,290
What the fuck are
you talking about?

458
00:34:30,966 --> 00:34:33,353
A refrigerated truck.

459
00:34:34,336 --> 00:34:37,403
He wants a cold environment

460
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,280
to slow the flow of blood,

461
00:34:40,938 --> 00:34:45,783
clean and mobile so he can
dump the garbage afterwards.

462
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:48,793
So I'm looking for a
refrigerated truck now?

463
00:34:48,817 --> 00:34:51,451
Probably a stolen one.

464
00:34:52,605 --> 00:34:55,651
You think there are a lot
of stolen trucks out there?

465
00:34:55,766 --> 00:34:59,330
Are you nuts?
In Miami?

466
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:05,403
Choir... kids... Just
do something.

467
00:35:05,518 --> 00:35:07,501
Just find my husband.

468
00:35:07,536 --> 00:35:10,611
Ma'am, the detectives are
looking into everything.

469
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:14,332
<i>I'm pretty sure I
covered all my tracks.

470
00:35:14,365 --> 00:35:18,961
- What do you care about that woman?
- I don't. I was just --

471
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:22,191
You like when women cry?
You like that?

472
00:35:22,505 --> 00:35:24,102
What's your thing, psycho?

473
00:35:24,136 --> 00:35:25,873
I was just heading to
the briefing room.

474
00:35:25,905 --> 00:35:27,852
You got no call to be in there,
so flee.

475
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:30,733
Lieutenant, this fucking
guy doesn't belong.

476
00:35:30,766 --> 00:35:32,392
I'm still waiting for
his spatter report

477
00:35:32,406 --> 00:35:35,333
on the cokehead murders --
Go do that.

478
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,561
It's okay.
I don't want to upset anybody.

479
00:35:37,607 --> 00:35:40,551
He can stay.
I'd like your input,

480
00:35:40,577 --> 00:35:43,110
and we'll discuss your
case after the meeting.

481
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:45,702
How about we get started?

482
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:48,572
- ?Encontr?ste algo?
- Nada todav?a.

483
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:51,011
- Hazme un favor y qu?tate la gorra.
- Disc?lpame.

484
00:35:59,738 --> 00:36:03,603
- You ready?
- I'm gonna shame this bitch.

485
00:36:03,635 --> 00:36:06,781
Just state your case clean and easy.
You'll be the hero.

486
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:09,933
Okay, settle down.

487
00:36:09,966 --> 00:36:12,503
Now, has anyone tracked
down that witness?

488
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:18,762
Come on, people.
Someone needs to find something here.

489
00:36:18,905 --> 00:36:23,151
- Lieutenant Laguerta?
- Officer Morgan.

490
00:36:23,205 --> 00:36:25,350
I didn't recognize you
with your clothes on.

491
00:36:27,406 --> 00:36:31,963
I have an idea,
something in a different direction.

492
00:36:32,508 --> 00:36:33,960
An idea?

493
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:37,741
Well, please, share it with us.

494
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:45,572
- Cell crystallization.
- Excuse me?

495
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:48,121
A little more confidence,
please.

496
00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:51,300
On the last victim,

497
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:53,773
I'd like to check and see
if any refrigerated trucks

498
00:36:53,806 --> 00:36:58,681
have been stolen in
the last... week or so.

499
00:36:59,206 --> 00:37:02,523
Refrigerated trucks
like ice-cream trucks?

500
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:08,831
No, not ice-cream trucks.

501
00:37:08,868 --> 00:37:10,332
A refrigerated vehicle

502
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:12,831
that could cause that
kind of tissue damage,

503
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:15,651
a refrigerated truck that's...

504
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:19,060
...mobile so he'll be
harder to catch,

505
00:37:19,135 --> 00:37:24,433
a refrigerated truck that
might give us a lead.

506
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:30,451
That's very interesting,
very creative.

507
00:37:30,475 --> 00:37:32,183
Let's keep looking
for the witness, okay?

508
00:37:32,197 --> 00:37:34,501
We know that he or she is out there.
The forensic evidence,

509
00:37:34,638 --> 00:37:36,673
the interrupted cut proves
that there was an eyewitness.

510
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:39,163
Now, somebody out
there saw something,

511
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:41,710
so let's concentrate on
finding that person, okay?

512
00:37:41,735 --> 00:37:42,360
But --

513
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:45,111
Just keep talking
to all your hookers.

514
00:37:46,605 --> 00:37:49,101
That's all for today.

515
00:37:55,636 --> 00:37:59,411
What the fuck was I supposed to say?
The only reason I'm in here

516
00:37:59,537 --> 00:38:01,723
is because the captain said
they had to let me in.

517
00:38:01,806 --> 00:38:04,393
But he didn't say they
had to listen to you.

518
00:38:04,406 --> 00:38:05,801
Well, right again.

519
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:08,732
So say adi?s to my career.
I'm gonna die a meter maid.

520
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:12,542
Stop it. Deb, there's another way.
Find the truck.

521
00:38:16,866 --> 00:38:21,332
Excuse me, Dexter...
My office, please.

522
00:38:28,468 --> 00:38:30,662
What the hell?

523
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:36,161
What the fuck?

524
00:38:37,617 --> 00:38:40,200
Are you boning her?

525
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:42,692
- No.
- Oh, my god!

526
00:38:42,736 --> 00:38:45,513
- Deb, wait.
- Shut up.

527
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:50,801
It had nothing to
do with drugs.

528
00:38:50,836 --> 00:38:52,903
L.T., this is a waste
of our damn time.

529
00:38:52,936 --> 00:38:54,682
I think sergeant
Doakes is right.

530
00:38:54,706 --> 00:38:56,932
I read the other reports,
all the other forensic analysis.

531
00:38:56,968 --> 00:39:00,170
Everyone agrees the cokehead murders
had nothing to do with cocaine.

532
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:01,930
It was a crime of passion.

533
00:39:01,968 --> 00:39:04,652
The murderer came to kill
the woman, not the dealer.

534
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,002
He did him quick and
got him out of the way.

535
00:39:06,037 --> 00:39:08,573
But he sure as hell took his
sweet time slicing up that lady,

536
00:39:08,606 --> 00:39:11,001
and you don't do that
unless you have a close,

537
00:39:11,038 --> 00:39:15,750
personal relationship with someone.
Probably an ex-boyfriend.

538
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:17,901
That's who I'd look for.

539
00:39:20,656 --> 00:39:22,081
Okay.

540
00:39:22,307 --> 00:39:26,492
It's a bit of a push, but,
sergeant, you should check it out.

541
00:39:34,265 --> 00:39:37,201
I'm watching you, motherfucker.

542
00:39:50,537 --> 00:39:52,960
<i>Jaworski's been coming
here for weeks --

543
00:39:53,005 --> 00:39:55,561
<i>likes to steal all
the copper plumbing.

544
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:58,090
<i>There's good money in that.

545
00:39:58,906 --> 00:40:02,403
<i>No security guards --
that's good.

546
00:41:06,566 --> 00:41:08,583
- Fuck!
- Talk.

547
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:11,380
- What do you mean?
- I think you know what I mean.

548
00:41:11,405 --> 00:41:15,010
No. Oh, god.

549
00:41:15,037 --> 00:41:17,853
Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

550
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:20,933
Okay.
I did her.

551
00:41:20,968 --> 00:41:24,612
- How?
- In a movie -- snuff film.

552
00:41:24,638 --> 00:41:28,332
- But I'm not sorry.
- Of course not.

553
00:41:29,507 --> 00:41:32,401
No, I'm not sorry, either.

554
00:41:54,308 --> 00:41:59,960
- Hello?
- Hey. I'm -- I'm sorry.

555
00:42:00,007 --> 00:42:03,132
I mean,
I'm sorry about the other night,

556
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:09,012
but... look, Dex, I really,
really need to see you.

557
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:13,933
So can you --
can you come by later,

558
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:16,262
you know, just for,
like, a little while?

559
00:42:16,307 --> 00:42:18,702
I mean, I'm really --

560
00:42:20,068 --> 00:42:23,133
All right.
What are you doing now?

561
00:42:23,568 --> 00:42:25,461
I'm just finishing
up a little project,

562
00:42:25,505 --> 00:42:27,912
but I'll come by later.

563
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:30,193
Okay, bye.

564
00:42:45,138 --> 00:42:47,532
<i>All in all,
it was a good night.

565
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:51,430
<i>One less amateur filmmaker
polluting the internet.

566
00:43:23,036 --> 00:43:25,071
No way!

567
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:02,802
Give us a minute.

568
00:45:03,336 --> 00:45:05,861
Hanging in there?

569
00:45:06,066 --> 00:45:08,710
This will teach me to tailgate.

570
00:45:08,857 --> 00:45:10,702
Let's go over this again.

571
00:45:10,737 --> 00:45:14,601
- I'm all yours.
- So all the ice trucks in Miami --

572
00:45:15,038 --> 00:45:18,731
- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?
- Sure, during business hours.

573
00:45:18,906 --> 00:45:21,400
But this time of night,
a truck like that sticks out.

574
00:45:21,437 --> 00:45:23,303
And you followed it.

575
00:45:24,527 --> 00:45:25,953
That's right.

576
00:45:25,968 --> 00:45:30,282
- You never saw the driver?
- Just high beams and a flying head.

577
00:45:30,938 --> 00:45:35,003
So then he must have already had
the head with him in the front seat.

578
00:45:35,308 --> 00:45:38,332
That's weird.
Why would he keep it there?

579
00:45:38,367 --> 00:45:40,933
I don't know,
so he could use a carpool lane?

580
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:48,602
It just seems odd.
Your sister has this ice-truck theory,

581
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:51,302
and then here you
are to back it up.

582
00:45:51,335 --> 00:45:54,231
She's good, lieutenant.
You should give her a chance.

583
00:45:54,568 --> 00:45:57,633
You know,
you should call me Maria.

584
00:45:57,717 --> 00:46:01,103
But I'll tell you who's good --
you are.

585
00:46:01,135 --> 00:46:04,163
Doakes picked up the killer
in the cokehead murders.

586
00:46:04,405 --> 00:46:07,241
You were right.
It was her boyfriend.

587
00:46:07,446 --> 00:46:10,053
Of course, Doakes
still hates you.

588
00:46:10,427 --> 00:46:11,953
Of course.

589
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:17,611
Tell me, Dexter,

590
00:46:17,645 --> 00:46:20,201
how did you get
to be so smart?

591
00:46:22,808 --> 00:46:25,480
Lots of sleep.

592
00:46:28,605 --> 00:46:30,852
Is it okay if I fill out
that report tomorrow?

593
00:46:32,465 --> 00:46:35,533
Sure thing.
You're tired.

594
00:46:37,065 --> 00:46:41,562
- Good night, lieutenant.
- I'll catch you later.

595
00:46:56,068 --> 00:47:00,110
Dex.
It's been a while.

596
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:04,132
- I'm sorry.
- I was worried.

597
00:47:04,168 --> 00:47:07,361
I didn't know what to do.
I called in sick.

598
00:47:08,038 --> 00:47:10,162
I mean...

599
00:47:12,805 --> 00:47:16,081
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I was just --

600
00:47:16,468 --> 00:47:19,830
I'm sorry.
There was another... You know.

601
00:47:28,307 --> 00:47:32,401
Look... The kids
slept over next door.

602
00:47:33,485 --> 00:47:35,460
Okay.

603
00:47:36,326 --> 00:47:41,233
- Would you like to come in?
- Okay.

604
00:47:41,265 --> 00:47:43,231
Okay.

605
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:58,532
I don't want to lose you, Dex.

606
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:03,103
Okay, sure.

607
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:11,333
And... well... I want you.

608
00:48:11,866 --> 00:48:13,533
I mean...

609
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:26,232
Okay.
Thanks.

610
00:48:27,918 --> 00:48:30,201
You're welcome.

611
00:48:50,168 --> 00:48:54,531
- Do you mind?
- No.

612
00:49:08,805 --> 00:49:13,591
- It could be the kids.
- Better get it, then.

613
00:49:17,635 --> 00:49:20,031
Hello?

614
00:49:20,408 --> 00:49:22,432
Cody.

615
00:49:22,466 --> 00:49:24,260
Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

616
00:49:26,865 --> 00:49:30,360
All right.
I'll come get you.

617
00:49:33,168 --> 00:49:37,261
Cody just threw up all
over Colleen's couch.

618
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:41,503
I got to go get him.

619
00:49:45,866 --> 00:49:50,923
- Tell me we're okay.
- Better than.

620
00:49:51,777 --> 00:49:55,932
- Okay.
- Go be a good mom.

621
00:50:14,537 --> 00:50:16,900
<i>Okay, that was close.

622
00:50:19,336 --> 00:50:22,601
<i>I'll admit,
making out with Rita was...

623
00:50:22,637 --> 00:50:24,903
<i>Interesting.

624
00:50:25,145 --> 00:50:26,990
<i>But if I don't keep a lid on this,

625
00:50:27,008 --> 00:50:28,693
<i>it could be the end of us.

626
00:50:51,908 --> 00:50:56,411
<i>I suppose I should be upset,
even feel violated,

627
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:58,841
<i>but I'm not.

628
00:50:59,147 --> 00:51:01,521
<i>No.

629
00:51:01,557 --> 00:51:03,281
<i>In fact,
I think this is a friendly message,

630
00:51:03,306 --> 00:51:06,730
<i>kind of like,
"hey, want to play?"

631
00:51:07,438 --> 00:51:10,733
<i>And, yes, I want to play.

632
00:51:10,968 --> 00:51:13,043
<i>I really, really do.
