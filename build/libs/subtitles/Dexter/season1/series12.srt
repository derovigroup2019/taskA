1
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:48,575
Previously on "Dexter"...

2
00:01:48,612 --> 00:01:50,619
I got here as fast as I could.
What are we looking at?

3
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,493
Female victim,
cut up into pieces.

4
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,383
The ice-truck killer?
So soon?

5
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,100
<i>This is what he wanted
me to find all along.</i>

6
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:01,713
<i>Dexter...</i>

7
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:05,337
Laura Moser...

8
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:07,290
My mother.

9
00:02:07,477 --> 00:02:10,190
Laura Moser and 3 others found
chopped up with a chain saw.

10
00:02:10,383 --> 00:02:12,777
Your father was a decent
man and an honest cop,

11
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,565
but what he saw in that
cargo container changed him.

12
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:21,816
Angel was stabbed
from behind.

13
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:23,200
You think
it's the attacker's blood?

14
00:02:23,236 --> 00:02:24,520
We know Batista fought back.

15
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:25,742
The samples you gave
me were a match.

16
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:27,000
They're from the same person.

17
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:28,493
So if you or that skinny bitch

18
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:29,760
try to screw with what's mine,

19
00:02:29,805 --> 00:02:32,381
I swear to God,
I don't care who I have to hurt.

20
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:34,400
<i>Let's face it, Paul.</i>

21
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:36,061
<i>You've been a problem.</i>

22
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:41,520
I need you to explain to
them why you're in this place.

23
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,241
I have no fucking idea
why I'm in this place.

24
00:02:44,588 --> 00:02:46,222
You really don't
want to do this.

25
00:02:46,308 --> 00:02:49,093
Effective immediately, you will
no longer serve as my lieutenant.

26
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:51,003
This isn't fucking over, Tom!

27
00:02:51,276 --> 00:02:52,533
Debra Morgan...

28
00:02:52,996 --> 00:02:54,490
Will you marry me?

29
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:56,953
Yes, yes, yes.

30
00:02:57,788 --> 00:02:58,951
Where's my sister?

31
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:01,761
Took her code 12.
Left about an hour ago.

32
00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:04,050
She went to dinner?
She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

33
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:06,553
You made it easy.

34
00:03:07,508 --> 00:03:10,200
So desperate to fall in love.

35
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:14,403
Where the fuck are you?
I'm here at work, and you're not.

36
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:15,800
I need to talk to you.

37
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:18,001
Do not see Rudy
until you find me.

38
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:42,060
<i>I've lived in
darkness a long time.</i>

39
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:44,001
<i>Over the years,
my eyes adjusted</i>

40
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:47,703
<i>until the dark became my
world and I could see.</i>

41
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:55,001
<i>But then Rudy turned
on the light.</i>

42
00:03:55,408 --> 00:03:58,182
<i>He flooded my memory,
and now I'm blind.</i>

43
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:03,911
<i>I don't have much time --</i>

44
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:07,243
<i>or, to be more accurate,
my sister doesn't have much time.</i>

45
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,520
<i>He wants me to find him,
but where do I look?</i>

46
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:11,903
<i>I can't think.</i>

47
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:13,803
<i>It's too bright.</i>

48
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:19,622
Let me know if the
tape's too tight.

49
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:21,761
You know, there's no need
for you to be uncomfortable.

50
00:04:21,948 --> 00:04:23,602
Why are you doing this?

51
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,863
Wouldn't want to
spoil the surprise.

52
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:32,780
Oh, God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

53
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:35,261
Shh, I'm just checking
the supplies, okay?

54
00:04:35,497 --> 00:04:37,930
Things are moving a little
faster than I had planned.

55
00:04:39,136 --> 00:04:40,441
This isn't you.

56
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:42,012
Pretty sure it is.

57
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:42,921
No!

58
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:46,001
I know there's more --
I've seen it.

59
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:52,381
I never wanted to hurt you.

60
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:56,030
I know. I know.

61
00:04:58,018 --> 00:05:01,160
Does this make it easier for you?
Because I can keep going.

62
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:03,123
Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus.

63
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:08,230
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Oh, Jesus Christ!

64
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:10,311
There's nothing to be
ashamed of, Deb. I mean,

65
00:05:10,355 --> 00:05:12,603
you're not the only one
who bought it, okay?

66
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,223
Your name isn't even
fucking Rudy Cooper, is it?

67
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:16,203
Nope...

68
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,660
But he died
for a good cause.

69
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:20,160
Yeah, so will you.

70
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:23,300
You kidnapped a cop this time,
you know?

71
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:26,333
Not some invisible hooker --
you kidnapped a cop!

72
00:05:26,957 --> 00:05:28,780
It's all part of the plan.

73
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:31,763
Oh, Jesus.

74
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:35,042
It's hard to believe it's
almost come to fruition.

75
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:37,810
I mean, this is a lot of years
in the making.

76
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,622
We're only hours away.

77
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:44,841
<i>He wouldn't have taken
Deb unless he left me</i>

78
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:47,730
<i>everything a clever monster
would need in order to find them.</i>

79
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:20,383
* Born free, *

80
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:25,633
* As free as the wind blows *

81
00:06:26,098 --> 00:06:29,520
* As free as the grass grows *

82
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:34,683
* Born free to
follow your heart *

83
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:41,070
<i>Seems I have a
new screen saver.</i>

84
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,323
<i>I knew he wouldn't
leave me stranded,</i>

85
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:45,673
<i>but "Born free"?</i>

86
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:53,961
<i>Of course.</i>

87
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:58,503
<i>Thanks to Rudy, now I know where
dearly disturbed Dexter was born.</i>

88
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:05,553
<i>Born free</i>

89
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,753
<i>of all that's human --</i>

90
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:10,283
<i>That's where I'll find him.</i>

91
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:43,511
She knows.

92
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:52,301
She knows.

93
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,883
All fucking night with that.

94
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:56,183
She knows.

95
00:07:58,195 --> 00:08:00,271
Listen, Angel,
we need your help.

96
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:01,760
Masuka says you were
following up a lead

97
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:03,401
on the ice-truck killer
when you were attacked.

98
00:08:03,446 --> 00:08:05,420
A hooker with a
prosthetic hand.

99
00:08:05,515 --> 00:08:07,233
John painted her nails
different colors,

100
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:08,370
but it didn't go nowhere.

101
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:10,911
Except she was just cut up
by the ice-truck killer.

102
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:14,162
Holy shit.
Monique was a victim?

103
00:08:15,546 --> 00:08:17,330
Now, we're operating
on the theory

104
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:18,703
that he found out you
were on his trail.

105
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:20,032
And if we're right,
that means you got stabbed

106
00:08:20,076 --> 00:08:21,613
for a reason.
It wasn't no carjacking.

107
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:22,781
How did he know it was me?

108
00:08:22,815 --> 00:08:24,503
No one knew what I was
doing except Masuka.

109
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:27,223
Someone else had
to know. Think.

110
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,671
I consulted with Rudy,

111
00:08:28,706 --> 00:08:30,890
Debra's boyfriend,
the prosthetics guy.

112
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:35,030
But that's crazy, right?

113
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:37,250
No, she's been AWOL since going
out last night to meet him.

114
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:38,883
She was supposed to come
back and help me canvass,

115
00:08:38,907 --> 00:08:41,042
- but she never made it.
- That's not like her.

116
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:43,681
- Angel, we got to go.
- Go, just go.

117
00:08:56,985 --> 00:09:00,830
<i>There are roughly 5,000 cargo
containers in the port of Miami.</i>

118
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:04,022
<i>Finding the one where my mother
was butchered took a bit of magic.</i>

119
00:09:04,305 --> 00:09:05,000
Busted.

120
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:06,942
Busted.

121
00:09:19,497 --> 00:09:20,283
Shit.

122
00:09:21,816 --> 00:09:22,793
Just a second!

123
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:36,580
I told you he was here.

124
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:39,302
There some reason you're not
answering your damn phone?

125
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:40,290
Ambien.

126
00:09:42,535 --> 00:09:44,311
What happened here, Dexter?

127
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:47,021
I couldn't find the remote.

128
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:48,463
Where's your sister?

129
00:09:48,695 --> 00:09:51,271
She didn't come back to work,
and she's not at her apartment.

130
00:09:51,455 --> 00:09:53,240
I honestly don't
know, sergeant.

131
00:09:53,455 --> 00:09:54,983
Dexter...

132
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:57,993
We think her boyfriend Rudy's
connected to the ice-truck killer.

133
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:00,301
We're working on getting
a search warrant right now

134
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:01,363
to search his home.

135
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:03,650
No.
Wow...

136
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,000
Cut the crap.

137
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:06,611
You know something.
What?

138
00:10:06,656 --> 00:10:07,761
James!

139
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,051
I saw him last night,
skulking in the lab,

140
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:12,151
ordering secret blood tests.

141
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:15,410
What kind of tests?

142
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:19,930
I was looking for a type match on
the blood on Batista's collar.

143
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:21,667
And whose was it?

144
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:25,595
Rudy's.

145
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:28,036
- Motherfucker.
- Knock it off!

146
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,981
- He knew all along!
- Rudy lied about a cut on his lip.

147
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:33,232
Angel headbutted his
attacker in the face.

148
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:35,452
- It was just a wild hunch.
- Why didn't you tell us?

149
00:10:35,507 --> 00:10:38,061
I couldn't destroy Deb's
love life on a hunch.

150
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,750
- I had to get the facts.
- Here are the facts:

151
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:42,792
if he kills her, it's your fault.
Now, what else do you know?

152
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:45,060
That's it.

153
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:46,442
He's lying.

154
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:49,483
Give him a break, James.
It's his sister, all right?

155
00:10:50,457 --> 00:10:52,602
Well, if he knows what's good for her,
he'll sit his ass at home

156
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:54,823
and answer the fucking
phone when it rings.

157
00:11:01,846 --> 00:11:03,713
Call if you hear anything.

158
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:16,751
Hello?

159
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:18,451
Please don't hang up.

160
00:11:18,508 --> 00:11:19,563
Paul?

161
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:21,862
The kids don't want
to talk to you, all right?

162
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,280
You got to give them
more time.

163
00:11:23,357 --> 00:11:24,681
This isn't about them.

164
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,372
It's about how
I was arrested.

165
00:11:26,405 --> 00:11:29,213
Yeah, with a needle in your arm --
I know all about it.

166
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:30,281
Well, I don't.

167
00:11:30,518 --> 00:11:33,291
Listen, I take responsibility
for all the shit I pulled,

168
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,593
but, Rita,
I was in the program.

169
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,192
I kicked the hard stuff.

170
00:11:37,226 --> 00:11:38,472
Well, apparently not.

171
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,472
I was clean.
I swear on my kids' lives.

172
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:43,963
It's been driving
me nuts how I got --

173
00:11:44,197 --> 00:11:46,493
from your house one minute
to the motel room the next,

174
00:11:46,526 --> 00:11:48,501
completely out of
my mind on junk.

175
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:50,510
Yeah, it's called
a blackout, Paul.

176
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:51,771
- It's called a setup.
- Well done.

177
00:11:51,855 --> 00:11:53,283
The last thing I remember

178
00:11:53,306 --> 00:11:55,670
was standing in the
kitchen, talking to Dexter.

179
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:57,801
Now, he could have smacked
me over the head and

180
00:11:57,845 --> 00:12:00,142
dragged me out of the house
probably through the backyard.

181
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:01,823
You really are a piece of work.

182
00:12:01,935 --> 00:12:03,040
I'm telling you --

183
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,281
Dexter is not who
you think he is.

184
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:08,201
Hello?

185
00:12:08,847 --> 00:12:11,331
This one, I've got to make sure we
got about seven copies of these.

186
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:13,510
I want to make sure it's
distributed to everyone, okay?

187
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:16,173
Okay, his name is Rudy Cooper.

188
00:12:16,256 --> 00:12:17,981
Some of you may
have met him.

189
00:12:18,008 --> 00:12:19,901
He was dating
officer Morgan.

190
00:12:19,968 --> 00:12:22,170
Now, she was last
seen 16 hours ago,

191
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:24,753
driving to meet him at
the Miami Beach marina.

192
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,851
So we need to canvass
the entire area.

193
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:29,010
Check boat rentals.
You guys know the drill.

194
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:32,243
I've already sent a team over to
his prosthetics lab at the hospital.

195
00:12:32,388 --> 00:12:34,742
The judge just signed off on the
warrant for Cooper's apartment.

196
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:36,512
Well, let's tear
that place apart.

197
00:12:36,998 --> 00:12:39,242
Jake, Sergio, Kim,
you guys are with me.

198
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:40,552
Your attention, please.

199
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:44,411
I want to introduce you to our
new lieutenant, Esmee Pascal.

200
00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:47,853
She agreed to put her vacation
on hold, come in early,

201
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:48,930
to provide us with

202
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:51,371
some much-needed leadership
at this critical time.

203
00:12:51,557 --> 00:12:53,383
Lieutenant, you're on.

204
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,801
I understand we
have a new suspect

205
00:12:56,846 --> 00:12:58,382
in the ice-truck killer case.

206
00:12:58,506 --> 00:13:00,531
We're on our way over
now to search his place.

207
00:13:00,586 --> 00:13:01,680
And you are...

208
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:04,571
Maria Laguerta.

209
00:13:04,907 --> 00:13:07,040
And we have an officer missing,
so we need to move fast.

210
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:09,151
I thought that sergeant Doakes
was running that investigation.

211
00:13:09,177 --> 00:13:11,102
- He's out following a lead.
- What lead?

212
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:13,761
He said he'd let me know if it came
to anything. Now if you excuse me --

213
00:13:13,797 --> 00:13:16,281
I'll take it over from here.
Thank you, Maria.

214
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,093
Who here can get me up to
speed on the way over?

215
00:13:19,468 --> 00:13:21,230
I can, I guess.

216
00:13:22,127 --> 00:13:23,342
You're driving.

217
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,192
And feel free to join us when
you locate your partner.

218
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:29,391
Would you like to come
with us, captain?

219
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:31,592
You seem to have
everything under control.

220
00:13:32,016 --> 00:13:33,552
Let's go, people.

221
00:13:52,386 --> 00:13:54,260
<i>It's in there somewhere --</i>

222
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:55,293
<i>My birthplace.</i>

223
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:57,801
<i>Now what?</i>

224
00:14:00,355 --> 00:14:03,413
<i>No cameras,
no patrols, no dogs.</i>

225
00:14:03,596 --> 00:14:05,560
<i>With billions spent
on Homeland Security,</i>

226
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:08,282
<i>it can't be as easy
as a couple of snips.</i>

227
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:16,491
<i>So much for the war on terror.</i>

228
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:43,731
<i>Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard</i>

229
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:45,981
<i>isn't hard when every
straw is computerized.</i>

230
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:59,371
<i>Reefer yard, plug 4-3-6.</i>

231
00:15:04,357 --> 00:15:06,223
<i>I don't like this place.</i>

232
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,850
<i>Something nameless
was born here...</i>

233
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,722
<i>Something that lives
in the deepest, darkest hole</i>

234
00:15:12,757 --> 00:15:14,642
<i>of the thing called "Dexter."</i>

235
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:30,472
Get in there!

236
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:33,962
Somebody else --
Get in there now!

237
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,521
It's all right, little guy.
You're safe now.

238
00:15:37,845 --> 00:15:40,992
Nothing will hurt you --
I promise.

239
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:14,200
Okay, Deb...

240
00:16:15,546 --> 00:16:16,902
don't be dead.

241
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:22,493
Shit.

242
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,771
Surprise, motherfucker.

243
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:29,470
Are you following me now?

244
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:31,252
You better have a hell of
a reason for being here.

245
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:32,482
I'm looking for my sister.

246
00:16:32,517 --> 00:16:33,861
In a cargo box?

247
00:16:34,008 --> 00:16:35,543
Yeah, I'm kind of
working on a theory.

248
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,970
You forget you work
for the fucking cops?

249
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:39,252
We love theories.
Spin me a story, asshole.

250
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:41,001
What I do on my time is
my business, sergeant.

251
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:43,150
Yeah, me too,
and I'm on my time now.

252
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:45,102
There's no lieutenant
here to save your ass,

253
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:46,743
so don't fuck with me,
Morgan!

254
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:48,113
All right, you got me.

255
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:51,312
I ordered some
furniture from Thailand.

256
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:52,890
I was waiting for
it to be delivered.

257
00:17:00,995 --> 00:17:02,862
Lab geek --
My ass.

258
00:17:04,346 --> 00:17:06,311
Hey, what the hell's
going on over here?!

259
00:17:06,495 --> 00:17:08,572
Security, I need to get
somebody down here right now.

260
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:09,442
Miami metro P.D.

261
00:17:09,468 --> 00:17:11,091
Yeah
Is this guy under arrest?

262
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,933
That's a good question.

263
00:17:13,337 --> 00:17:15,093
You're connected to this.

264
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:17,191
I don't know how,
but I'm gonna find out,

265
00:17:17,428 --> 00:17:19,883
and some of what I find is
gonna stick to your ass.

266
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:38,923
Let me out of
here, motherfucker!

267
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:40,743
Let me out of here!

268
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:46,570
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out, you piece of shit!

269
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:51,153
Let me out of here,
you fucking piece -- Aah!

270
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:56,521
Fuck! Let me out!

271
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:59,520
Sorry, but you were
drowning out Fred's radio,

272
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:02,000
and he was kind enough
to lend us his wheels.

273
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:05,993
Bye!

274
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:21,640
<i>His happy place,
where he kills more than time --</i>

275
00:18:22,065 --> 00:18:24,071
<i>This is where he'd
leave me a clue.</i>

276
00:19:09,787 --> 00:19:13,540
- Hey, Dexter, better bundle up.
- I like the cold.

277
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:15,911
You know, hypothermia can
easily sneak up on you.

278
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,781
Yeah, and so can hypochondria.

279
00:19:18,068 --> 00:19:21,071
And a home setup like this would
take years to put together.

280
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:23,173
He must have hated
leaving it behind.

281
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:24,802
What are you looking for?

282
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:27,001
A clue, signature
or calling card --

283
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:29,821
Anything that might give us
a sense of where he went.

284
00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:32,230
Well, I don't think he was exactly
thinking about us when he did this.

285
00:19:32,268 --> 00:19:33,962
I mean, look at this place.

286
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:36,611
Hey, you were right about the
victim at Santa's cottage.

287
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,051
He rushed his work.

288
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:40,821
He killed that girl to keep
us busy so he could escape,

289
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:43,470
but he wouldn't go without
leaving us a message.

290
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:44,801
We just need to find it.

291
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:48,170
Check this out.

292
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:51,422
This is where he
played with his meat.

293
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:54,900
Pretty whacked out, huh?

294
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:57,332
I can think of 101
uses for this table.

295
00:19:57,365 --> 00:19:59,072
Know what I mean?

296
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:01,100
He has my sister, Vince.

297
00:20:01,705 --> 00:20:02,570
Right.

298
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:04,991
I mean -- I didn't
mean -- I'm sorry.

299
00:20:05,607 --> 00:20:06,743
Shit.

300
00:20:07,147 --> 00:20:08,451
You're Karen, right?

301
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:09,621
That's right.

302
00:20:09,757 --> 00:20:12,340
You're in charge of evidence --
this entire room -- evidence.

303
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:14,941
Take photos of every item
in its original position:

304
00:20:14,987 --> 00:20:16,030
work-kit, packages...

305
00:20:16,067 --> 00:20:18,043
Show me the inventory
list when you're done.

306
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:22,893
Is he in charge?

307
00:20:23,397 --> 00:20:25,000
Guess he is now.

308
00:20:29,407 --> 00:20:30,263
Rita?

309
00:20:30,307 --> 00:20:30,992
Rita?

310
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:33,792
Hi. I'm Bob Hicks.

311
00:20:34,778 --> 00:20:36,080
Can I help you?

312
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:37,951
I guess Paul never
mentioned me.

313
00:20:38,328 --> 00:20:40,641
I'm his Narcotics
Anonymous sponsor.

314
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:43,361
Right.

315
00:20:43,405 --> 00:20:46,230
So, having your sponsor
do your dirty work --

316
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,812
Which step is that?

317
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:50,982
See, he's --
he's just concerned for the kids.

318
00:20:51,178 --> 00:20:53,423
No, he's concerned for himself.
If you'll excuse me...

319
00:20:53,657 --> 00:20:56,521
I thought he was lying,
too, until I saw the proof.

320
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,331
What proof?

321
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:01,432
Well, the X-rays the prison
doctor took of Paul's head --

322
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:03,511
They showed a
skull fracture.

323
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:05,663
Yeah, which I
deservedly gave him.

324
00:21:05,705 --> 00:21:07,451
No.
You didn't.

325
00:21:07,857 --> 00:21:10,002
See,
after you struck him,

326
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:12,150
the hospital took X-rays --
No fracture.

327
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:16,142
- But in prison, a fracture.
- If you know Paul,

328
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:18,272
you'd know he'd bash his
own head against the wall

329
00:21:18,305 --> 00:21:19,480
to get what he wants.

330
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:22,861
Well, I do know Paul.
I think I know him pretty well.

331
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:24,682
No, listen,
if Paul was attacked,

332
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:28,061
the way that it happened --
that takes expertise, skill.

333
00:21:28,475 --> 00:21:30,633
No first-timer is gonna
be able to pull that off.

334
00:21:30,678 --> 00:21:33,392
Yeah, which is why his
accusations are ludicrous.

335
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:36,530
Dexter spends all his time in
a laboratory, for God's sake.

336
00:21:36,577 --> 00:21:38,050
So you've been there?

337
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:41,320
Bob...

338
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:43,512
You seem like a nice man,

339
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:46,092
but this is none of
your goddamn business.

340
00:21:47,246 --> 00:21:48,321
Okay.
Got it.

341
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:51,301
We traced the name and
social of Rudy Cooper

342
00:21:51,537 --> 00:21:54,631
to a New Jersey plumber who
mysteriously died in '98.

343
00:21:54,678 --> 00:21:56,353
You got to be kidding me.
After all this,

344
00:21:56,387 --> 00:21:57,952
we still don't have an I.D.
on this guy?

345
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,872
Rudy isn't his real name?

346
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:02,210
- You trying to be smart?
- Not trying, no.

347
00:22:02,247 --> 00:22:03,821
If you fucking know his name,
you better --

348
00:22:03,857 --> 00:22:07,182
Whatever it is going on
between you two, it ends now.

349
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,943
What did you find in there?

350
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:16,752
Other than the obvious,
a lot of trace bloodstains.

351
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:18,623
It's probably where
he killed them all,

352
00:22:18,857 --> 00:22:21,382
but I'd like to look at the rest
of the apartment before I go.

353
00:22:21,526 --> 00:22:22,273
Yeah, okay.

354
00:22:35,107 --> 00:22:37,542
- You mind if I...
- Be my guest.

355
00:22:41,136 --> 00:22:44,842
<i>It's perfect --
Right out in the open.</i>

356
00:22:45,217 --> 00:22:47,091
<i>At least he's consistent.</i>

357
00:22:48,528 --> 00:22:50,911
Was there anything else
near this record player?

358
00:22:51,427 --> 00:22:53,152
Yeah, a fucking doll
sitting on top.

359
00:22:55,655 --> 00:22:57,431
"Home sweet home."

360
00:22:57,618 --> 00:22:59,683
<i>Is he taking me back
before the blood,</i>

361
00:22:59,915 --> 00:23:02,063
<i>to a place where
a boy was born?</i>

362
00:23:02,668 --> 00:23:05,103
<i>"Home sweet home",
but which "home"?</i>

363
00:23:19,336 --> 00:23:21,010
Down on the floor, please.

364
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:28,290
It's kind of foolish, Deb.

365
00:23:37,806 --> 00:23:39,602
I don't usually work this way.

366
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:41,160
Call it

367
00:23:41,626 --> 00:23:45,293
an homage to a fellow
traveler I greatly admire.

368
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:58,001
<i>Laura Moser --
addict, dealer --</i>

369
00:23:58,376 --> 00:23:59,783
<i>My mother.</i>

370
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:02,981
<i>Arrested in '69,
again in '71.</i>

371
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:05,313
<i>Same address
listed both times.</i>

372
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:08,971
<i>1235 Mangrove Drive.</i>

373
00:24:09,255 --> 00:24:11,512
<i>They say home is
where the heart is.</i>

374
00:24:11,876 --> 00:24:14,202
<i>Maybe this is
where I left mine.</i>

375
00:24:15,318 --> 00:24:16,340
Surprise.

376
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:19,412
What are you doing here?

377
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:22,573
White-chocolate mocha --
Your favorite.

378
00:24:22,855 --> 00:24:24,411
I'm gonna have to
drink it on the road.

379
00:24:24,495 --> 00:24:27,500
You know, I've never even been here
before. I'd love a tour sometime.

380
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:29,201
Yeah, sometime that's not now.

381
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:31,073
Dexter, what's going on?

382
00:24:31,107 --> 00:24:33,172
It's Deb, okay?
She's in trouble.

383
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,500
Oh, God.
Is it serious?

384
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,780
Yeah, actually,
it's very serious,

385
00:24:36,927 --> 00:24:39,643
but I just can't worry about you,
too, right now.

386
00:24:47,776 --> 00:24:52,050
She knows. She knows.
She knows.

387
00:24:52,198 --> 00:24:54,542
<i>...been leaving a
trail of dead bodies.</i>

388
00:24:54,687 --> 00:24:56,601
<i>Authorities say
their big break came</i>

389
00:24:56,657 --> 00:24:58,903
<i>when they found a video
of his latest victim.</i>

390
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:01,671
If she knows, you yapping about it
ain't gonna change it. Shut the fuck up!

391
00:25:01,758 --> 00:25:05,233
<i>The suspect is operating under
an alias -- "Rudy Cooper."</i>

392
00:25:05,516 --> 00:25:07,790
<i>We didn't have his fingerprints
in our criminal database,</i>

393
00:25:07,957 --> 00:25:09,870
<i>so his identity is
still unclear to us.</i>

394
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:13,580
- She knows. She knows.
- So sorry, Mr. Batista.

395
00:25:13,765 --> 00:25:16,022
We had to take the psych
overflow from County,

396
00:25:16,525 --> 00:25:19,513
- but this one's harmless.
- Yeah, don't be so sure.

397
00:25:19,577 --> 00:25:21,533
We never take
the violent ones.

398
00:25:21,717 --> 00:25:24,153
They have the arsonists,
the rapists,

399
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:26,043
the psycho killers over there.

400
00:25:26,227 --> 00:25:29,371
I tell you --
Those people belong in prison.

401
00:25:31,457 --> 00:25:34,082
Do they fingerprint
psych patients at County?

402
00:25:34,128 --> 00:25:34,960
Yes, of course.

403
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:37,222
Half of them don't
know their own names.

404
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:39,331
Got to I.D. them somehow.

405
00:25:39,565 --> 00:25:42,603
That should take care of him.
Enjoy the peace and quiet.

406
00:25:54,605 --> 00:25:55,910
I.D. tech.

407
00:25:56,058 --> 00:25:58,442
Hey, it's, uh, Batista.
Can you do me a favor?

408
00:25:58,508 --> 00:26:00,833
I need you to run
Rudy Cooper's prints

409
00:26:01,116 --> 00:26:03,463
against psych, mental,
and institution records.

410
00:26:33,936 --> 00:26:35,761
* Ring around the rosie *

411
00:26:35,955 --> 00:26:37,971
* A pocket full of posies *

412
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:40,591
* Ashes, ashes *

413
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:42,881
* We all fall down! *

414
00:26:46,346 --> 00:26:50,200
Dexter!
Dexter!

415
00:26:51,127 --> 00:26:53,471
Where are you,
you silly little bear?

416
00:26:54,248 --> 00:26:57,063
I'm gonna find you!

417
00:26:58,358 --> 00:26:59,800
Where can you be?

418
00:27:00,226 --> 00:27:04,452
You silly little goose.
I'm gonna find you!

419
00:27:06,436 --> 00:27:09,061
You silly bear.
Where is my baby?

420
00:27:09,526 --> 00:27:12,441
Where is my Dexter?
Where are you?

421
00:27:12,606 --> 00:27:14,560
- Here!
- Oh, my goodness!

422
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:16,441
Oh my goodness!

423
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:19,332
You surprised me,
you stinky little bear.

424
00:27:19,527 --> 00:27:22,211
Hey, where could your
brother be hiding?

425
00:27:22,258 --> 00:27:23,851
Bynie's right there!

426
00:27:31,835 --> 00:27:35,263
- Hey, Bynie.
- You weren't supposed to tell her.

427
00:27:35,827 --> 00:27:38,312
You remember now?

428
00:27:41,547 --> 00:27:42,800
Bynie.

429
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:46,260
You always had trouble
saying "Brian."

430
00:27:48,716 --> 00:27:50,212
I have a brother.

431
00:27:50,258 --> 00:27:51,952
A real brother --

432
00:27:52,658 --> 00:27:54,860
None of this foster bullshit.

433
00:27:55,317 --> 00:27:59,031
We're blood brothers,
through birth and death.

434
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,170
Watching mom die --

435
00:28:01,726 --> 00:28:04,451
It's amazing that
we survived that, isn't it?

436
00:28:05,927 --> 00:28:11,481
The chain saw,
the flying body parts, the blood.

437
00:28:27,075 --> 00:28:28,483
You were there, too.

438
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:32,281
Two days sitting in blood
before they found us,

439
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:34,851
but you were young
enough to block it out.

440
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,150
I've never forgotten
the day that we were...

441
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:38,790
- Born.
- Exactly.

442
00:28:40,965 --> 00:28:42,221
Where's Deb?

443
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:46,053
I waited for you
before we got started.

444
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,280
- Debra!
- She's not in here.

445
00:28:53,658 --> 00:28:54,400
Deb!

446
00:28:56,246 --> 00:28:57,171
Debra!

447
00:28:57,308 --> 00:28:59,980
This is not the way I
envisioned our family reunion.

448
00:29:01,555 --> 00:29:03,810
Come on, let's just sit down
and have a beer.

449
00:29:05,608 --> 00:29:06,340
Deb?

450
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,661
That was the best wipeout.

451
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:12,370
You didn't even cry.

452
00:29:12,406 --> 00:29:14,060
Next time you
try my skateboard,

453
00:29:14,105 --> 00:29:16,860
bend your knees, okay?

454
00:29:19,528 --> 00:29:20,270
Hi.

455
00:29:20,828 --> 00:29:21,612
Hi.

456
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,273
Look out!

457
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,411
I didn't want to
do it this way.

458
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:42,772
Okay, let's run his description
against Interpol's fugitive list,

459
00:29:42,956 --> 00:29:44,262
in case he isn't American.

460
00:29:44,448 --> 00:29:45,372
Rudy Cooper?

461
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,791
His real name
is Brian Moser.

462
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,463
Angel, what the hell
are you doing here?

463
00:29:49,556 --> 00:29:51,050
I got a hit on his prints

464
00:29:51,338 --> 00:29:54,531
from a Tampa mental
hospital where he grew up.

465
00:29:54,646 --> 00:29:59,022
He was institutionalized for
antisocial personality disorder.

466
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,912
At 21, they said he was cured.
They released him.

467
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:04,173
Run the name "Brian
Moser" for credit cards,

468
00:30:04,215 --> 00:30:06,323
bank accounts,
real-estate holdings --

469
00:30:06,356 --> 00:30:08,261
anything that might tell
us where he's got Morgan.

470
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,103
Listen up.

471
00:30:09,188 --> 00:30:11,612
We've triangulated
officer Morgan's cellphone.

472
00:30:11,655 --> 00:30:14,051
Last known location --
20 miles off the coast,

473
00:30:14,135 --> 00:30:16,002
which means he's
got her on a boat.

474
00:30:16,057 --> 00:30:19,012
Lieutenant, we have his real name.
We're digging into his records now.

475
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:22,622
His name's not gonna help
us find him in open water.

476
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:24,440
I want a coordinated search
with the coast guard.

477
00:30:24,477 --> 00:30:26,373
- Waste of time.
- Chain of command.

478
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,222
Flyovers, helicopters,
whatever it takes.

479
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:30,442
Lieutenant, that signal
died last night.

480
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,831
By now, he has most likely
taken her to his final location.

481
00:30:34,156 --> 00:30:35,702
Noted.

482
00:30:37,265 --> 00:30:38,960
Let's get busy, people.

483
00:30:45,046 --> 00:30:47,000
Flyovers look
good to the press,

484
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:48,391
but they won't find Morgan.

485
00:30:48,427 --> 00:30:49,503
You think the press
matters to me?

486
00:30:49,527 --> 00:30:52,173
It matters to Captain Matthews,
and he calls the shots.

487
00:30:52,498 --> 00:30:55,230
Look, I know you need
to define yourself here

488
00:30:55,265 --> 00:30:57,330
and putting me in my place
is one way to do that,

489
00:30:57,515 --> 00:30:59,250
but one of our own is missing,

490
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,630
and we shouldn't waste
our time pissing on trees.

491
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:03,793
I agree.

492
00:31:04,065 --> 00:31:05,842
I can also see why
you were reassigned,

493
00:31:06,025 --> 00:31:08,141
and it has nothing to
do with incompetence

494
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:11,673
and everything to do with the
Captain trying to save his job.

495
00:31:12,816 --> 00:31:13,752
Okay.

496
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:16,121
Now, I was hired
with the directive

497
00:31:16,178 --> 00:31:18,381
to not make
your life easy.

498
00:31:19,926 --> 00:31:22,160
So you're gonna
ignore the lead?

499
00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:27,203
You don't know me very well,

500
00:31:27,437 --> 00:31:30,150
but luckily for officer Morgan,

501
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:32,121
neither does the Captain.

502
00:31:43,566 --> 00:31:45,340
Nothing personal.

503
00:31:45,847 --> 00:31:48,101
I swore that I'd have a --

504
00:31:48,237 --> 00:31:50,421
beer with you before
we got started.

505
00:31:50,706 --> 00:31:52,983
You made that kind
of difficult.

506
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:54,530
Sorry.

507
00:31:55,805 --> 00:31:58,492
You don't ever have to
apologize to me, Dexter.

508
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:02,323
Not for who you are
or anything you do.

509
00:32:05,876 --> 00:32:08,552
Looks just like it used to,
doesn't it?

510
00:32:10,265 --> 00:32:12,472
Who does it belong to?

511
00:32:12,508 --> 00:32:13,701
Me.

512
00:32:18,275 --> 00:32:19,720
I got it for you, actually.

513
00:32:23,695 --> 00:32:27,081
I'm really more an
apartment person.

514
00:32:28,978 --> 00:32:31,513
You're trapped in a lie,
little brother,

515
00:32:31,977 --> 00:32:35,663
the same lie they
tried forcing me into.

516
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:38,591
- "They"?
- You know...

517
00:32:39,245 --> 00:32:42,622
Doctors, therapists,
group leaders --

518
00:32:42,808 --> 00:32:44,542
What a family they were.

519
00:32:44,608 --> 00:32:46,801
You were never put
up for adoption.

520
00:32:46,828 --> 00:32:47,933
Afraid not.

521
00:32:48,006 --> 00:32:49,431
You were 3,

522
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:52,943
a little bird with
a broken wing.

523
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:57,172
First cop on the scene --
Harry Morgan.

524
00:32:58,515 --> 00:33:00,920
He wanted to make
you all better.

525
00:33:01,076 --> 00:33:02,582
But me --

526
00:33:02,586 --> 00:33:04,983
I could see it in his eyes.

527
00:33:05,498 --> 00:33:08,433
All he saw was a
fucked-up kid --

528
00:33:08,806 --> 00:33:10,350
They all did,

529
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:12,021
so they locked me up.

530
00:33:13,965 --> 00:33:16,390
I didn't even
know you existed.

531
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:17,910
Of course you didn't.

532
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:22,312
Harry wanted to keep
you all to himself.

533
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:27,241
And while you were being
raised by the Morgan family,

534
00:33:27,846 --> 00:33:30,420
I only had the
memory of a family.

535
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:33,951
Me.

536
00:33:35,286 --> 00:33:37,681
Mom always told me
to look after you.

537
00:33:39,258 --> 00:33:41,501
Imagine how I felt

538
00:33:41,907 --> 00:33:43,700
when I tracked you
down and found out

539
00:33:43,738 --> 00:33:45,551
you were exactly like me.

540
00:33:46,556 --> 00:33:48,902
I don't have to imagine.

541
00:34:00,447 --> 00:34:02,931
I know what you've been going
through all these years --

542
00:34:03,205 --> 00:34:05,700
The isolation, the otherness,

543
00:34:05,735 --> 00:34:08,012
a hunger that's
never satisfied.

544
00:34:08,936 --> 00:34:11,332
Well, you're not
alone anymore, Dexter.

545
00:34:11,406 --> 00:34:12,901
You can be yourself

546
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,363
with me --

547
00:34:15,606 --> 00:34:17,302
your real,

548
00:34:17,585 --> 00:34:19,890
genuine self.

549
00:34:24,107 --> 00:34:26,403
Takes the breath away,
doesn't it?

550
00:34:51,248 --> 00:34:53,551
I think we're ready for Debra.

551
00:35:21,027 --> 00:35:23,511
I've prepared her just
the way you like.

552
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,632
This time,
we'll do it together.

553
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,233
Does it have to be Deb?

554
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,631
It's the only way.

555
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:38,202
But she's my...

556
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,410
Fake sister
I know.

557
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:43,760
Tell me something...

558
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:47,800
Your victims --

559
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:50,093
Are they all killers?

560
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:52,743
Yes.

561
00:35:53,156 --> 00:35:55,123
Harry teach you that?

562
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:00,333
He taught me a code...

563
00:36:01,297 --> 00:36:02,902
To survive.

564
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:07,840
Like an absurd avenger?

565
00:36:07,907 --> 00:36:09,472
That's not why I kill.

566
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:11,623
You can be yourself around me.

567
00:36:14,998 --> 00:36:17,602
Who am I?

568
00:36:19,085 --> 00:36:20,533
A killer...

569
00:36:24,608 --> 00:36:27,870
...without reason or regret.

570
00:36:28,796 --> 00:36:29,911
You're free.

571
00:36:31,076 --> 00:36:32,560
You can be that way, too.

572
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:37,622
What about the code?

573
00:36:37,818 --> 00:36:39,350
Damn it, Dex,

574
00:36:39,455 --> 00:36:42,233
you don't have a code.

575
00:36:42,605 --> 00:36:44,011
Harry did.

576
00:36:44,306 --> 00:36:46,932
And he's been dead 10 years.

577
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,210
You can't keep him
sitting on your shoulder

578
00:36:50,257 --> 00:36:51,782
like Jiminy
fucking Cricket.

579
00:36:53,937 --> 00:36:56,911
You need to embrace
who you are now.

580
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,700
I don't know who I am.

581
00:37:08,005 --> 00:37:10,080
Of course you don't.

582
00:37:10,255 --> 00:37:13,733
You've been away from your
family since you were 3,

583
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:17,160
but I'm here now.
I can help you.

584
00:37:17,766 --> 00:37:21,143
We can take this
journey together.

585
00:37:28,487 --> 00:37:29,651
I can't.

586
00:37:31,276 --> 00:37:32,390
Not Deb.

587
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:34,592
Oh, no. Don't --
Don't say that.

588
00:37:34,776 --> 00:37:36,082
I'm very...

589
00:37:38,395 --> 00:37:39,740
fond of her.

590
00:37:40,198 --> 00:37:42,770
You can't be a
killer and a hero.

591
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:45,111
It doesn't work that way!

592
00:38:00,548 --> 00:38:01,543
Morgan!

593
00:38:01,778 --> 00:38:03,491
Cover the yard!
We're going into the house!

594
00:38:04,246 --> 00:38:05,512
Fuck.

595
00:38:06,206 --> 00:38:07,561
In the garage!

596
00:38:08,397 --> 00:38:09,371
Through that door!

597
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:14,111
Cover this door!
Cover the door!

598
00:38:17,257 --> 00:38:20,821
Come on. Stay with me.
Shit.

599
00:38:21,975 --> 00:38:25,121
Maria, stay on the door.
He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.

600
00:38:26,325 --> 00:38:27,662
Cover me, man.

601
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:35,842
Get in.

602
00:38:43,837 --> 00:38:44,582
Shit.

603
00:38:56,117 --> 00:38:57,570
Chopper 1 to command --

604
00:38:57,758 --> 00:38:59,953
We're broadening the
search to a 5-mile radius.

605
00:39:00,828 --> 00:39:03,030
Any headache, dizziness?

606
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:05,733
I'm fine.
I just want to go home.

607
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:08,262
I'm afraid we have to transport
you to the hospital --

608
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,230
Standard procedure.

609
00:39:10,835 --> 00:39:12,231
You're saying Rudy called you?

610
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,613
Why would he do that?

611
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,682
I think he wanted me to
try to talk him down.

612
00:39:16,728 --> 00:39:19,182
He said he was having second
thoughts about killing Deb.

613
00:39:19,286 --> 00:39:21,311
He seemed to feel like we
have some kind of connection.

614
00:39:21,348 --> 00:39:22,930
He's not the only one.

615
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:25,932
He said he'd kill Deb if
I didn't show up alone.

616
00:39:26,128 --> 00:39:27,763
Well, you almost
fucking got her killed.

617
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:31,143
I'm gonna request an immediate suspension
when we get back to the station.

618
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:33,203
You're gonna what?

619
00:39:34,128 --> 00:39:35,483
Morgan, you shouldn't
be out here.

620
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,161
Are you questioning Dexter?

621
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:38,880
Morgan.

622
00:39:38,926 --> 00:39:41,030
Back the fuck off my brother!

623
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:43,973
He just saved my life!
He's a fucking hero!

624
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:47,923
Want each of you to treat him
that way, god damn it!

625
00:40:00,578 --> 00:40:01,881
Way to go, Deb.

626
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:06,591
I thought you were gonna burst
a frontal lobe out there.

627
00:40:06,925 --> 00:40:07,853
Assholes.

628
00:40:22,905 --> 00:40:25,013
Stop. You're gonna
dislocate it.

629
00:40:25,108 --> 00:40:26,803
Oh, God, get it off me.
I'm gonna be sick.

630
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:29,331
Relax.
Here.

631
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:37,471
He's still out there.

632
00:40:39,308 --> 00:40:40,400
Yeah.

633
00:40:42,738 --> 00:40:44,660
And he didn't get
what he wanted.

634
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:47,823
No.

635
00:40:49,376 --> 00:40:51,630
Think he'll try it again?

636
00:40:53,758 --> 00:40:54,822
Maybe.

637
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:57,502
Yeah.

638
00:40:57,556 --> 00:40:59,600
I'm gonna talk to Captain
Matthews about getting us

639
00:40:59,635 --> 00:41:01,862
an officer stationed outside
your hospital room tonight.

640
00:41:01,907 --> 00:41:04,263
No, I'm not staying in
a fucking hospital.

641
00:41:04,308 --> 00:41:06,420
There's nothing
fucking wrong with me.

642
00:41:06,657 --> 00:41:08,943
Well, you're not
staying at home.

643
00:41:09,086 --> 00:41:11,622
Well, I'll just
crash with you.

644
00:41:12,366 --> 00:41:14,840
Let's just wait and see what
the doctor says, all right?

645
00:41:15,435 --> 00:41:16,130
Yeah.

646
00:41:18,948 --> 00:41:19,822
Yeah.

647
00:41:26,296 --> 00:41:27,513
Why me, Dex?

648
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,713
Why'd he choose me?

649
00:41:35,008 --> 00:41:37,062
You're just lucky, I guess.

650
00:41:47,066 --> 00:41:50,392
I was so scared.

651
00:41:54,076 --> 00:41:57,880
I was so scared,
so scared.

652
00:41:57,906 --> 00:41:59,372
I know.

653
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:03,110
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

654
00:42:07,306 --> 00:42:09,922
Dad would be so proud.

655
00:42:16,677 --> 00:42:18,921
- Dexter?
- It's me.

656
00:42:19,507 --> 00:42:21,981
Paul, this is harassment.

657
00:42:22,018 --> 00:42:24,690
Just tell me if
he's acting weird.

658
00:42:24,965 --> 00:42:26,941
- Who?
- Dexter --

659
00:42:27,165 --> 00:42:28,993
He hasn't been himself lately,
has he?

660
00:42:29,137 --> 00:42:30,773
How could he be,
after what he did to me?

661
00:42:30,858 --> 00:42:32,292
All right, that's it.
I'm done.

662
00:42:32,345 --> 00:42:33,403
Call again,
and you can forget

663
00:42:33,437 --> 00:42:35,413
about seeing the kids
this weekend or ever.

664
00:42:35,455 --> 00:42:37,791
I am not gonna subject
them to your insanity.

665
00:42:37,918 --> 00:42:40,642
Fine, if that's what it takes
for you to listen to me.

666
00:42:40,785 --> 00:42:42,323
I just want to know
that they're safe.

667
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:43,771
Why are you doing this, Paul?

668
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:46,491
You want me to be miserable
and alone like you? Is that it?

669
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,753
All I want

670
00:42:48,386 --> 00:42:50,400
is for you to
look for a shoe.

671
00:42:50,525 --> 00:42:51,513
A shoe?

672
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,730
Could be in the kitchen.
Could be in the backyard.

673
00:42:53,895 --> 00:42:56,433
It's missing.
I checked, and it wasn't in the items

674
00:42:56,496 --> 00:42:58,733
that they got from the motel
room when I was arrested.

675
00:42:58,768 --> 00:43:00,293
And why would it be here?

676
00:43:00,356 --> 00:43:03,000
I was trying to figure out
why my ankle was so bruised.

677
00:43:03,255 --> 00:43:07,333
Now I'm thinking it got banged
when Dexter dragged me out,

678
00:43:07,845 --> 00:43:11,700
- when my shoe was knocked off.
- Good night, Paul.

679
00:43:12,676 --> 00:43:13,552
Night.

680
00:43:22,216 --> 00:43:23,051
Screw you.

681
00:43:24,158 --> 00:43:25,893
<i>What did I just do?</i>

682
00:43:26,816 --> 00:43:31,242
<i>I drove away a brother who accepts me,
sees me,</i>

683
00:43:31,427 --> 00:43:34,571
<i>for an adopted sister
who'd reject me if she knew</i>

684
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:37,521
<i>and a foster father
who betrayed me.</i>

685
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:41,162
<i>That's what it was --
A betrayal.</i>

686
00:43:41,447 --> 00:43:44,122
<i>The most important
single fact about me --</i>

687
00:43:44,196 --> 00:43:47,070
<i>I'm not alone --
and Harry kept it from me.</i>

688
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:49,642
<i>What do I really
owe him after that?</i>

689
00:43:54,788 --> 00:43:55,990
Mr. Morgan?

690
00:43:59,096 --> 00:44:00,893
Mr. Morgan?

691
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:02,392
That's me.

692
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:04,912
Your sister has a few bruises,
but no major injuries.

693
00:44:05,006 --> 00:44:06,930
Still, you should
keep an eye on her.

694
00:44:07,115 --> 00:44:09,133
I'll write a prescription
for a mild sedative.

695
00:44:09,308 --> 00:44:10,420
But she's okay, right?

696
00:44:10,656 --> 00:44:12,772
She can go home with you
tonight, far as I'm concerned,

697
00:44:12,808 --> 00:44:16,422
or we can keep her here at the
hospital -- it's your choice.

698
00:44:22,846 --> 00:44:25,141
Don't worry.
The sheets are clean.

699
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:28,750
We aim to please
here at "Chez Dex".

700
00:44:31,346 --> 00:44:34,302
I'll be sleeping on the couch
with a spring in my side

701
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:37,252
just to make sure you're
safe tonight, but...

702
00:44:37,946 --> 00:44:41,233
We're gonna have to talk
tomorrow about a long-term plan,

703
00:44:42,715 --> 00:44:45,251
after you get a
good night's sleep.

704
00:44:45,898 --> 00:44:46,780
Deb?

705
00:45:00,545 --> 00:45:02,021
Good night, sister.

706
00:46:31,847 --> 00:46:33,950
I stopped by your
prosthetics lab

707
00:46:34,097 --> 00:46:36,440
after I left Deb
at the hospital.

708
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:41,962
Your work's so good,
you even fooled yourself.

709
00:46:44,687 --> 00:46:46,651
Sweet dreams, Bynie.

710
00:47:13,448 --> 00:47:14,323
Hey.

711
00:47:19,716 --> 00:47:21,860
You weren't supposed
to wake up.

712
00:47:22,097 --> 00:47:23,363
I guess not.

713
00:47:23,737 --> 00:47:24,662
Sorry.

714
00:47:25,496 --> 00:47:28,451
Police recorded all your
knives as evidence.

715
00:47:30,905 --> 00:47:33,440
Took a while to find
your dinner flatware.

716
00:47:33,628 --> 00:47:34,462
Sterling.

717
00:47:37,518 --> 00:47:39,903
I keep it for
special occasions.

718
00:47:40,965 --> 00:47:42,322
Which you are.

719
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:48,691
I can give you more
tranquilizer if you want.

720
00:47:49,888 --> 00:47:52,342
It's a service I
don't usually offer.

721
00:47:55,046 --> 00:47:57,553
What am I --
One of your victims now?

722
00:47:58,645 --> 00:48:00,281
You going to collect
a little sample

723
00:48:00,566 --> 00:48:02,480
of Bynie's blood for
your slide collection?

724
00:48:02,817 --> 00:48:04,820
No, you're not a trophy...

725
00:48:06,485 --> 00:48:08,831
...but you need to be put down.

726
00:48:09,007 --> 00:48:10,311
Why?

727
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:12,471
Because of your code?

728
00:48:17,607 --> 00:48:19,423
The safety of my sister.

729
00:48:21,136 --> 00:48:23,721
She's not your real sister.

730
00:48:24,618 --> 00:48:28,261
She's a stranger to you,
and she'll always be one.

731
00:48:28,508 --> 00:48:30,201
I tried to help
you by killing her.

732
00:48:30,218 --> 00:48:31,892
I know that!

733
00:48:40,105 --> 00:48:42,513
You should know this
isn't easy for me.

734
00:48:51,956 --> 00:48:54,942
You've done more to deserve
my knife than anyone.

735
00:49:04,936 --> 00:49:08,650
You're the only one I
ever wanted to set free.

736
00:49:09,716 --> 00:49:13,660
You're the one that needs
setting free, little brother.

737
00:49:14,775 --> 00:49:16,740
Your life is a lie.

738
00:49:17,898 --> 00:49:19,351
You'll never be what you --

739
00:49:27,258 --> 00:49:28,301
Sorry.

740
00:49:28,556 --> 00:49:31,053
I can't hear any more...

741
00:49:33,687 --> 00:49:35,653
'cause you're right.

742
00:50:19,405 --> 00:50:21,153
How did you know he was here?

743
00:50:21,186 --> 00:50:22,991
A neighbor saw the door open.

744
00:50:23,028 --> 00:50:25,511
We got his fingerprints on the knife,
a note on the fridge,

745
00:50:25,696 --> 00:50:27,850
and a single incised
wound to the neck.

746
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,701
Slight upward angle.

747
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:33,732
Even a stigmata of
hesitation in the stroke.

748
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:37,053
Looks like a clear suicide.

749
00:50:38,108 --> 00:50:40,530
He does himself the same
way he did the hookers.

750
00:50:40,607 --> 00:50:42,431
- Poetic.
- Retarded.

751
00:50:42,466 --> 00:50:44,533
Look at him
-- He's dead.

752
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:47,151
The ice-truck killer
always flaunted his kills

753
00:50:47,205 --> 00:50:49,001
like he was untouchable.

754
00:50:49,238 --> 00:50:50,631
By taking his own life,

755
00:50:50,826 --> 00:50:52,502
he's preventing us from
ever catching him.

756
00:50:52,536 --> 00:50:54,332
I don't care why he did it.

757
00:50:54,415 --> 00:50:56,431
I'm just glad he did.

758
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:16,822
Decaf mochaccino, nonfat, no whip --
your favorite.

759
00:51:17,467 --> 00:51:19,312
I got your message.

760
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:21,181
How's Debra?

761
00:51:22,697 --> 00:51:24,522
She has all her limbs.

762
00:51:24,606 --> 00:51:26,630
Thank God she's alive.

763
00:51:26,806 --> 00:51:29,100
That poor thing
must be a mess --

764
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:31,351
Falling for a serial killer.

765
00:51:31,407 --> 00:51:33,100
What are the odds?

766
00:51:33,286 --> 00:51:35,582
- What about you?
- What about me?

767
00:51:35,778 --> 00:51:38,910
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah.

768
00:51:46,077 --> 00:51:46,913
No.

769
00:51:55,648 --> 00:51:57,841
I've been through a lot lately.

770
00:52:01,016 --> 00:52:03,361
I could use a little
more time with you --

771
00:52:04,017 --> 00:52:05,271
and the kids.

772
00:52:07,608 --> 00:52:09,280
We could, too.

773
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,760
I'm sorry I've been so --

774
00:52:25,508 --> 00:52:28,182
Next time, could you just

775
00:52:28,805 --> 00:52:30,752
let me know what's going on?

776
00:52:31,118 --> 00:52:34,350
I mean, when you
didn't return my calls, I --

777
00:52:34,405 --> 00:52:36,180
started to get
a little paranoid.

778
00:52:36,966 --> 00:52:39,280
I can be better about that.

779
00:52:39,818 --> 00:52:41,351
Good.

780
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:46,373
Who knows?

781
00:52:46,655 --> 00:52:49,751
You might even find I
can handle the truth.

782
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:54,172
<i>I wish that was the case.</i>

783
00:52:55,887 --> 00:52:58,112
<i>The reality is,
there's nobody left alive</i>

784
00:52:58,148 --> 00:52:59,851
<i>who can handle my truth.</i>

785
00:53:09,406 --> 00:53:12,252
<i>Doakes always sensed
I was hiding something.</i>

786
00:53:12,306 --> 00:53:13,670
<i>Now he knows.</i>

787
00:53:14,036 --> 00:53:15,953
<i>My devil danced
with his demon,</i>

788
00:53:15,986 --> 00:53:18,213
<i>and the fiddler's tune
is far from over.</i>

789
00:53:32,518 --> 00:53:34,330
<i>Sometimes, I wonder
what it would be like</i>

790
00:53:34,386 --> 00:53:35,901
<i>for everything inside me</i>

791
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:38,752
<i>that's denied and unknown
to be revealed.</i>

792
00:53:46,198 --> 00:53:48,013
<i>But I'll never know.</i>

793
00:53:48,207 --> 00:53:50,221
<i>I live my life in hiding.</i>

794
00:53:50,456 --> 00:53:52,710
<i>My survival depends on it.</i>

795
00:53:54,595 --> 00:53:56,650
<i>Dearly damaged Debra --</i>

796
00:53:56,846 --> 00:53:59,331
<i>She's here to face what's
left of the monster,</i>

797
00:53:59,568 --> 00:54:02,851
<i>spit on his carcass,
mourn him.</i>

798
00:54:03,687 --> 00:54:05,321
<i>She's in hiding now, too.</i>

799
00:54:06,206 --> 00:54:07,593
<i>Harry's daughter
will be damned</i>

800
00:54:07,647 --> 00:54:10,313
<i>if she lets anyone see what
she's suffering inside.</i>

801
00:54:10,737 --> 00:54:12,190
<i>That's her tragedy.</i>

802
00:54:13,805 --> 00:54:16,140
<i>My tragedy is that I
killed the one person</i>

803
00:54:16,178 --> 00:54:17,752
<i>I didn't have to hide from.</i>

804
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:22,030
<i>And I'm the only
one who mourns him.</i>

805
00:54:29,295 --> 00:54:31,171
<i>Everyone else would
probably thank me</i>

806
00:54:31,348 --> 00:54:33,772
<i>if they knew I was the one
who drained him of his life.</i>

807
00:54:34,057 --> 00:54:36,581
Good job in there, Dex.
You sliced him up good.

808
00:54:38,027 --> 00:54:41,821
<i>In fact, deep down, I'm sure they'd
appreciate a lot of my work.</i>

809
00:54:47,556 --> 00:54:50,611
Way to take out the trash.
Thanks, buddy.

810
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:53,701
All right, Dexter,
protecting our children!

811
00:55:09,776 --> 00:55:13,280
<i>This is what it must feel like
to walk in full sunlight,</i>

812
00:55:13,956 --> 00:55:15,802
<i>my darkness revealed,</i>

813
00:55:16,467 --> 00:55:18,930
<i>my shadow self embraced.</i>

814
00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:29,110
<i>Yeah, they see me.</i>

815
00:55:30,408 --> 00:55:31,863
<i>I'm one of them...</i>

816
00:55:34,448 --> 00:55:36,271
<i>in their darkest dreams.</i>
