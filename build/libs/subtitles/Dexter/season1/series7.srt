1
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,860
Previously on Dexter.

2
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,987
It is my new friend.

3
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,363
When he broke into my apartment,

4
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,365
he took some time to get to know me --

5
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,493
my life, my secrets.

6
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,373
Same as the others -- no blood.

7
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,667
Somebody who was here
last night saw something.

8
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,086
They got a night watchman,
but we can't find him.

9
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:12,883
It's the guard -- Tucci.
I think he's alive.

10
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,593
Taking Tucci over to County.

11
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,888
Rudy here is gonna put
me back together again.

12
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:21,391
Yo, pretty boy,
you're stealing my thunder.

13
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,061
I don't know. I just might have
to fight you for this one.

14
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,897
How about you focus on
whether or not he was the man

15
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,191
you saw at the old hospital that night,
Mr. Perry?

16
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,985
It was difficult to tell.
It was dark.

17
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:35,489
Florida prisons kick free
25,000 inmates a year.

18
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,991
I search for the ones who
think they beat the system,

19
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,662
like Jeremy Downs.
Jeremy got off easy.

20
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,289
To the coroner,
the knife strokes looked random,

21
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,792
but I saw the work
of a young virtuoso.

22
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,294
Are you gonna fuck me, faggot?

23
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,296
'Cause I killed the
last guy who raped me.

24
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,299
I understand now.

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,177
Jeremy didn't murder
that boy four years ago.

26
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,596
He was taking out the garbage.

27
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,597
Wait, is that all?

28
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,490
The FBI estimates that there
are less than 50 serial killers

29
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,492
active in the United
States today.

30
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:29,084
We don't get together at conventions,
share trade secrets,

31
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,669
or exchange christmas cards...

32
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,673
But sometimes I wonder what
it's like for the others.

33
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,761
The only sound I hear,

34
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,764
the only sound in
the entire world...

35
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,060
...is my heart beating.

36
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,494
I swear to Christ,
Morgan, after this case,

37
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,997
I'm submitting your ass
for psychiatric evaluation.

38
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,167
I'm just retracing
castoff patterns,

39
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,085
directionality angles.

40
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,378
Can you tell us what
happened here or not?

41
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,464
- It's an execution.
- Unlikely victim.

42
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,799
The kid's an honor student,
editor of his school yearbook.

43
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,969
It's all in the knife work.
It's skillful, no wasted motion.

44
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,262
The killer had experience.

45
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,890
Every stroke hit a major artery...

46
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,560
Or at least came close.

47
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,987
Are you getting a goddamn
hard-on there, Morgan?

48
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,993
It's trully horrific.
He was yearbook committee, you said?

49
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,662
I want your report
on this tomorrow.

50
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,462
I wish I could say
Sergeant Doakes

51
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,881
is my biggest problem right now,
but he's not.

52
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,677
I've seen these wounds before.

53
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,059
You're drooling on
Laguerta's couch.

54
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,190
- You pulling a midnight shift?
- Lopez has the trots.

55
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,192
- Why are you still here?
- Why not?

56
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,778
Nothing at home except an
empty fridge and an empty bed.

57
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,863
If I wasn't married
and 10 years younger...

58
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,199
I'd still be in high school.
Keep dreaming.

59
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,283
Wiseass.

60
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,286
I've been chasing leads
on the ice-truck killer.

61
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,498
- Pathetic long shots, mostly.
- Yeah? What kind of leads?

62
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,459
I looked at the research.
With mass murderers,

63
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,378
it's dumb shit that
trips them up.

64
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,881
Son of sam got a parking ticket
outside his own crime scene.

65
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:43,885
So you ran parking violations at
the crime scenes of our guy? Smart.

66
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,888
Yeah, but none of the registered
owners had criminal records.

67
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,599
Try "moving violations."

68
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,562
Timothy McVeigh drove way too
fast on the way out of town.

69
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,778
Neil Perry -- I know that name.

70
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,161
Yeah, he came forward as
a witness two weeks ago

71
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,080
when pieces of Tony Tucci
were showing up around town.

72
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,082
He rode through a
stop sign two blocks

73
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,668
from the third crime scene
at the Seven Seas motel.

74
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,881
Why would a voluntary witness be
at two separate crime scenes?

75
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,176
I don't know.
Maybe he was chopping up hookers.

76
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,972
- Holy mother of fuck, is this him?
- Let's find out.

77
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,270
Are you sure this is
the right address?

78
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,188
According to DMV,
this is where Perry lives.

79
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,566
With his seven inbred cousins,
by the look of it.

80
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,194
Something has got to be wrong with
somebody that can live in a steel box.

81
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,696
Aluminum, actually.

82
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,699
Nina and I had a
deluxe multisectional.

83
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,868
- For real?
- It was our starter home.

84
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,580
This is our car.

85
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,165
One of the victims was seen getting in

86
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,667
a wood-paneled station wagon
on the night of her death.

87
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,462
Let's take one step at a time.
Let's find our guy.

88
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:04,299
According to his files, he works as
a computer analyst for Miami Lake.

89
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,093
Now maybe...
Look up... slowly.

90
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,097
All right, take the front door.

91
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,183
Cover all the exits.
I'm going to the back.

92
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,361
Open up, Perry!
It's the police!

93
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,072
Open up, Perry! Police!

94
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,281
Open up, Perry!

95
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,371
Open the door!

96
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,167
Hey, Angel, I got him!

97
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,878
Police! Stop running, Perry!

98
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,963
Get the fuck down!

99
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:53,765
Fuck!

100
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,867
I knew I recognized the knife
work of the killer.

101
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,494
Jeremy Downs.

102
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,372
I had him. He was mine...

103
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,792
Until I found out the boy
Jeremy killed raped him...

104
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,877
He fucked me and I killed him.

105
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,295
So I let Jeremy go.

106
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,464
It seemed fair.

107
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,677
But my random act of
kindness was misguided.

108
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,095
If I had followed my instincts,

109
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,889
this boy's high-school yearbook
would still have an editor.

110
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,562
Captain Matthews is coordinating the
FDLE to launch a statewide manhunt...

111
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,483
The task force will tear apart
the house for any evidence

112
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,194
that links Neil Perry to
the ice-truck murders.

113
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,781
We need proof this time, people --
tangible proof.

114
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,991
What is it?

115
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,869
They really found
the ice-truck killer?

116
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,662
I did.

117
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,290
Yes, yes.

118
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,376
We will financially guarantee
extradition from anywhere. James?

119
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,295
Yeah, I'm on it, lieutenant.
I'll run the task force.

120
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,298
Actually I need you and Pullman to stay with
the knife victim in the alley.

121
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,885
- His parents are high-profile.
- Whatever you need.

122
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,265
Angel... You found Perry.
You run the task force.

123
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,394
Contact the fugitive's friends,
family, co-workers, coke dealer --

124
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,687
anybody who might
try to hide him.

125
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,065
- You want us to circulate his photo?
- In neighborhoods only.

126
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,193
Keep it away from the media.
This case stays low-profile.

127
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,779
The last thing I need is
another tony Tucci on my hands.

128
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,697
- Anything else, lieutenant?
- Yes --

129
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,575
choose task-force members who can
put their regular duties aside

130
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,369
and bust ass until Neil
Perry's apprehended.

131
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,498
- Dominic.
- Okay, that's all. Thank you.

132
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,376
- Do you really think this is the guy?
- It's all lining up.

133
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,588
I saw him, Dex. I chased him.

134
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,675
Debra Morgan. Get over here.
You're on the team.

135
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,970
Do you hear that?
I'm on the team.

136
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,972
Do you think we get hats?

137
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,184
Hardly looks a guy capable
of terrorizing Miami.

138
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,769
A science camp, maybe.

139
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,566
I'm off.
I'll keep you in the loop.

140
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,987
- Where's my blood report, Sparky?
- I'm on it, sergeant.

141
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,794
- How you doing, Mrs. Bennett?
- Hey, Charlie.

142
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,087
Where are the kids?

143
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,589
Your husband swung by a few minutes ago.
He didn't tell you?

144
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,758
I never seen Cody light
up like that before.

145
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,385
Big treat --
the old man coming down.

146
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,096
Wait, wait. Wait. Paul?

147
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,681
Yeah. He just picked up the kids.

148
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,268
You gave my children to Paul?
Are you stupid?

149
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,187
I told the
administrative office

150
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,982
that Cody and Astor are not to
be released into his custody!

151
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,485
- Well, nobody told me.
- He just got out of fucking jail!

152
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,868
Everyone, follow strict,
sterile protocol.

153
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,495
There will be no contamination
of my crime scene.

154
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:08,167
Bag anything that could be used to
murder or dispose of a human body.

155
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,587
That's pretty much
everything in here, boss.

156
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:14,591
Except this.
Can you say "sick fuck"?

157
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,259
Some might say that.

158
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,470
To others,
crypto-taxidermy is a fine art.

159
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,473
I got a mummified
chupacabra at home.

160
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,268
Can I have permission to run Masuka's
prints as the ice-truck killer?

161
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:29,272
I'll give you some
warm DNA right now.

162
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,482
God, you're gross.
I didn't hear that.

163
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,694
Detective, I found something.

164
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,573
An archive of hidden files.
A lot of how-to documents --

165
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,576
draining blood from cattle,
wartime amputation techniques.

166
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,494
"Butchering the human carcass"?

167
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,372
There's even an article about countries
that don't extradite to the U.S.

168
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,167
- We got this fucker.
- We got jack shit, Morgan.

169
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,377
Everything in here
is circumstantial.

170
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,087
We need some hard evidence.

171
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,466
HEY I'm not done looking yet. Are you?

172
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,472
The school had no right to
release my children to Paul.

173
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,974
- No, they didn't.
- He lost his custody rights

174
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,393
right around the time my head
hit the living room wall.

175
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,686
I would think so.

176
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,772
I should be out
looking for my kids.

177
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,690
Rita, the best thing you
could do for the kids

178
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,277
- is stay here in case he calls.
- What if he doesn't?

179
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,698
What if he kidnapped them to get
back at me for putting him in jail?

180
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,784
Dexter, I --

181
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,666
- Hi.
- I got you.

182
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,169
Astor!

183
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,672
Mom, look -- it's dad.
He came home.

184
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,967
Yeah. What,
you think I was gonna move to the moon?

185
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,885
Stop it. Just stop.

186
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,179
Do you know I called the police?

187
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,598
Why? I told you I was
taking tm to the carnival.

188
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,893
- No, you didn't.
- Rita, I called you at the hotel.

189
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,186
They said you were on a break,

190
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:54,273
so I left a message with
the info and my cell number.

191
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,281
Uh, hi. How are you?

192
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,368
I'm Paul Bennett,
father on parole.

193
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,079
Uh, Dexter Morgan.

194
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,499
Uh, I can't think of
anything clever to say.

195
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,797
Paul, this is unacceptable.
I have custody.

196
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,174
You can't just take them
without my permission.

197
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,385
I came to see my babies.

198
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,471
I missed them, Rita.

199
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,890
I missed a lot of things.

200
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,985
I should phone the station,
call off the dogs.

201
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:43,072
- Dexter, look -- my dad's home.
- Yeah, I see that, buddy.

202
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,465
Hey, Angel.

203
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,884
You're the expert on
manufactured living.

204
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,677
This closet look a
little small to you?

205
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,891
A little.

206
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,490
Sweet.

207
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,669
I've got newspaper articles.

208
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,963
"Dismembered body
found in a pool."

209
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,799
"Ice-truck killer
appalls Miami."

210
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,467
This is a record of
everything he's ever done.

211
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,760
I got photos.

212
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,677
?

213
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,179
Did we release those
photos to the press?

214
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,680
- No.
- Did he take them himself?

215
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,681
He had to.

216
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,559
- Did we just hit the mother lode?
- No.

217
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,896
We hit the motherfucking
mother lode.

218
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,484
The evidence just keeps
piling up at the mobile home.

219
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,570
I just authorized an
excavation of the back patio.

220
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,697
I think there's
something buried there.

221
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,282
What are we doing
to find Neil Perry?

222
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,285
I put his name in the automated
system and notified the FBI.

223
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,495
Airports on alert?

224
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,997
Airports, train stations,
bus lines.

225
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,499
We should track
his credit cards.

226
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,876
Already done,
along with A.T.M.s and bank accounts.

227
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,795
I also put a tap
on his home phone.

228
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,384
- Seems you thought of everything.
- It seems that way.

229
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,686
- Look, Maria --
- No need to apologize.

230
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,980
I don't require your
approval to do my job.

231
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,981
I know that.

232
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,692
I've been kicking your ass 'cause
I knew you had this in you.

233
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:46,195
Well, thank you for making
me the woman I am today.

234
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,574
I love you to everything.

235
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,162
I love you to everything, too.

236
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,879
He's not gonna hit you anymore.

237
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,590
He told me at the carnival.

238
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,175
I made him promise.

239
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,888
Thank you, baby.

240
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,273
I haven't had time to
process as much as the kids.

241
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,359
Paul was supposed to be
locked up for another year.

242
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,071
Cody seems to be
processing okay.

243
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,365
Cody's too young.

244
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,368
A dad's just a concept to him,
not a person.

245
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,995
But Astor --

246
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,165
she remembers what
he put us through.

247
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,879
Well, at least you're
not married anymore.

248
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,798
That's just it.

249
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,092
Technically, we are.

250
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,971
When Paul went to prison,
I started divorce proceedings,

251
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,265
but he refused to
sign the paperwork.

252
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,392
As a power play?

253
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,686
I don't think so.

254
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,564
I think for all the
darkness that haunts him,

255
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,566
Paul loves having a family.

256
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,277
I think he's just
afraid to let go.

257
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,281
When did you first notice it?

258
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,661
This darkness inside
the guy you fell for.

259
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,290
I always knew it was there.

260
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,085
I guess I just didn't
think I deserved better...

261
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:26,796
Till I met you.

262
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,765
I have a dark side, too.

263
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,270
What? I do.

264
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,064
Somehow I doubt that.

265
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,984
You have a good heart, Dexter.

266
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,861
You're not like Paul.
You don't hurt people.

267
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:57,994
Innocent people.

268
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,793
I don't hurt innocent people.

269
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,778
Hey, dude,
the bowling alley's around the corner.

270
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,993
Hey, I'm looking
for Jeremy Downs.

271
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:43,080
Jeremy? He vacated
the premises.

272
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,585
Focus. I'm trying
to find Jeremy.

273
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,087
Oh, I get it.

274
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,383
Look, man,

275
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,178
I'm not really into
that homo shit,

276
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,264
but I'm kind of short
on money for weed,

277
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,476
so I guess I'll do it for
less than Jeremy's charging.

278
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,271
- Wait. What does Jeremy charge?
- Jeremy's selling himself?

279
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:11,776
He's always hanging out with the
brokeback boys down at Flamingo Park.

280
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,278
Comes back with
fistfuls of cash.

281
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,164
It's me.
Get your ass over to Neil Perry's place.

282
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,875
- You're gonna want to see this.
- Deb, it's my day off.

283
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,293
Just get your ass over here.

284
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,587
We're about to bust open the
goods on the ice-truck killer.

285
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,186
Not what I expected.

286
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,765
So lifelike.

287
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,864
Hey, Dex.
I thought you'd want to be here.

288
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,575
Something's buried down there.
Masuka's been digging all night.

289
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,868
I hate to break
this to you, Deb,

290
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,786
but you know you've got
the wrong guy here, right?

291
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,081
The ice-truck killer drains
the blood from his victims,

292
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,876
freezes their bodies,
and only then severs their limbs.

293
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,962
It's clean and efficient --
his psychological signature.

294
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,381
Neil Perry, on the other hand,
stuffs roadkill.

295
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,175
Yeah, and turns it into
fucked-up fantasy shit.

296
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,760
But the fantasies are all wrong.
The guy we're looking for

297
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,472
wouldn't turn dead,
dirty things into living cartoons.

298
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,599
- He'd find that pathetic.
- How do you know?

299
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,268
Because it is pathetic.

300
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,688
Deb, trust me.
Neil Perry is not a killer.

301
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,565
He's a dabbler.
He's a waste of time.

302
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,359
If the guy we're looking for took
his early fantasies out on animals,

303
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,861
he'd bury them,
not display them.

304
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,281
And want about an early human kill?
Would he bury that, too?

305
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,867
- Sure. Probably.
- Then turn around.

306
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,077
You were saying?

307
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,372
It looks like an adult female.

308
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,876
Any idea how long the
body's been down there?

309
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,586
Based on decomposition,

310
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,963
she's been tits up for two,
maybe three years.

311
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,798
We'll know more
after the autopsy.

312
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,176
What happened to the limbs?
Did they rot off?

313
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,971
No. They're clean cuts.

314
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,973
But he didn't chop
up the whole body.

315
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,559
This could be
Perry's first kill,

316
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,561
like he was experimenting.

317
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,272
You're the expert, Dex.
What do you think?

318
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,984
Sure. Sounds good.

319
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,987
Actually, it sounds
perfectly awful.

320
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:06,784
For weeks, I've felt like a
student in a master class.

321
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,495
Is it really possible that
the master's on the run?

322
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,373
And even more tragic,

323
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,375
does he live in a double-wide?

324
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,879
The gravitron goes
so fast, mom.

325
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:22,091
My dad took me on
it three times.

326
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,384
Wow. Is that so?

327
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,972
All right,
let me cut you guys up some fruit.

328
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,683
Astor wouldn't go.
She was afraid.

329
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,769
So what?
I don't like fast rides.

330
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,688
Shh!

331
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,192
Hello?

332
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,364
- Who wants doughnuts?
- I do.

333
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,283
Paul, you can't just walk
in here whenever you want.

334
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,659
You don't live here anymore.

335
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,663
Oh. Sorry about that.
Old habits.

336
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,498
I'll ring the
doorbell next time.

337
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,588
I got these for you.

338
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:08,596
All right.
I'll just put them in, uh, something.

339
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,598
Dad, can I have a doughnut?

340
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,266
You got it, buddy. Coming up.

341
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,476
What, now you're making
me out to be the bad guy?

342
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,186
They haven't had breakfast yet.

343
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,858
You know what? Kidlet, my bad.
Sorry about that.

344
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,193
These doughnuts are
for after school.

345
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,779
But I could whip up
some eggs and pancakes.

346
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,657
- Paul!
- Very little syrup, I promise.

347
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,992
And meat

348
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,076
You into neat?
- Uh-huh.

349
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,369
I like meat

350
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:36,665
I like meat on my feet.
It's real squishy.

351
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:41,086
Paul. You can't do
this anymore, Paul.

352
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,673
What?! What?!
Help raise my kids?!

353
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,885
Yes, I can. That's my job.

354
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:51,972
All right, look.

355
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,895
I can't even begin to understand
how difficult this has been for you,

356
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,064
Rita, being a single mom, okay?

357
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,361
And for that,
I'm eternally sorry.

358
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,197
I let you down.

359
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,784
I let everybody down.

360
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,667
But if I could just
find that frying pan.

361
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,587
Astor... want to help
me find the frying pan?

362
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,764
We got a profile of Neil Perry.

363
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,391
He's a computer expert.

364
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,477
I.Q. off the chart.
He's a loner, no pryors.

365
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,479
His father split when he was 6.

366
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:44,775
His mother was an alcoholic, abusive,
and possibly his first victim.

367
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,986
Roberta Perry.

368
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,989
Dental records say she was
the one under the patio.

369
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,573
Now, Neil kept her death quiet

370
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,868
by cashing her social-security
checks for the last two years,

371
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,079
but he did not kill her
for the money.

372
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:58,580
Morgan?

373
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,457
We think he wanted release.

374
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,584
Roberta Perry ran
her son's life,

375
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,586
controlled him,
beat him as a kid.

376
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,588
We think he dreamt about
killing her for years.

377
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,465
I just spoke with Perry's
cellphone provider.

378
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,967
Can they track his location?

379
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,969
No signal --
he probably turned off his phone.

380
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,179
But, according to records,
he used it

381
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:17,057
on some of the nights the ice-truck
killer victims were taken.

382
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,183
Who did he call?

383
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,185
Voice mail, mostly,
checking messages.

384
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,979
Verizon triangulated
the location.

385
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,897
All the calls came
from the same place --

386
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,191
a six-block area on
southwest 8th street.

387
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,361
The Tamiami trail.
That strip's full of no-tell motels.

388
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,363
It's like a happy hunting
ground for hookers.

389
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,074
There's a good chance that's
where he's killing his victims.

390
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,368
Let's recanvass
the area for leads.

391
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,078
Now that we've got
a photo of this guy,

392
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,164
maybe we can find somebody
who actually saw him.

393
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,582
Let's go.

394
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,085
You're starting
to look like her.

395
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,963
Want to stop by your house,
check in with your family?

396
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,798
I'd rather check in
with your brother.

397
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,092
His instincts are usually
pretty good on this stuff.

398
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,261
Yeah, not today.
He'd just piss on our parade.

399
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,096
He needs his day off.

400
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,266
The first time I saw his work,

401
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:03,395
I felt like a spanish explorer landing
of the shores of the new world.

402
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:07,858
No blood in the victims,
no spatter, no stain.

403
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,361
Deb is wrong about him.

404
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,782
It's okay.
Hell, I've made mistakes.

405
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:18,285
In fact, I'm about to
correct a big one right now.

406
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,872
Jeremy Downs.

407
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,959
Hey, you want company?

408
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,295
Just keep walking
and looking ahead.

409
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,758
There's some mangroves over by the lake.
We can go in there.

410
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,469
It's too public.
My car's in the parking lot.

411
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,972
- Are your windows tinted?
- I said, "eyes front."

412
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,477
What's wrong?

413
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,067
Shit. Shit.

414
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,486
Get the fuck out of my way!

415
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,989
Take it easy, Jeremy!
Stay right there!

416
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,575
Take him down! Take him down!

417
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:03,288
Hands behind your back.
Stand up! Stand up!

418
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,263
Miami Metro P.D.
Can we have a minute?

419
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:19,763
Yeah.

420
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:22,766
- This guy look familiar?
- I don't know.

421
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,393
They come. They go.

422
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,187
You get it? They "come."

423
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:30,190
Look, my feet are aching
from pounding the pavement.

424
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,859
You think you
could help us out?

425
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,068
- What's your name?

426
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,488
Laline Consuelo Garci? G?mez.

427
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,160
Laline...

428
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,997
O?ste del hombre que
le dicen el ice-truck killer?

429
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,165
- S?.
- Puede ser el.

430
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,461
So let's try this again.
Have you seen this man?

431
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:57,384
He's a regular.
Rents a room by the month -- cash.

432
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,468
When was the last
time he was here?

433
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,263
He's here now. He brought a
girl to his room this morning.

434
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,890
A working girl? A hooker?

435
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,476
- What's the room number?
- 20. Here's the master.

436
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,271
Call for backup.
Let's hope this girl is still alive.

437
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,567
- Do we wait for tactical?
- Not with a possible victim in there.

438
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:29,791
Clear.

439
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,295
It's okay. We're here now.
You're safe.

440
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,968
Please get me out -- hurry --
before he comes back!

441
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,095
- Where is he?
- Please, I want to get out!

442
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,180
Where was he going?

443
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,891
The liquor store.
He said he's coming right back.

444
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,687
What?

445
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,777
Hey, where's Doakes?
He paged me.

446
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,570
We need your report from
that kid in the alley.

447
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,280
But it's my day off.

448
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,866
I was just at Don Shula's
famous golf course.

449
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:06,662
- Did you finish your report or not?
- Yeah, it's in my lab.

450
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,581
Wait. I'm on to you.

451
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,877
Excuse me?

452
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,797
Your crazy-ass,
knife-slashing two-step in the alley.

453
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,881
You were right.

454
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,759
You said the killer had
previous experience. He did.

455
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,971
Oh. Really?

456
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,974
Masuka lifted a print from the
alley that matched a kid from juvie.

457
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,269
Cut up a victim five years ago.
Same knife technique.

458
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,188
We just grabbed him
at Flamingo Park.

459
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,190
Great work, sergeant.

460
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,276
Yeah. Your instincts
were dead-on.

461
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,279
They're always dead-on when it
comes to killers. Why is that?

462
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,157
I'll just go get that report.

463
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,368
I'm watching you.

464
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:01,967
Miss me?

465
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,387
Police. On the ground.
Get down slowly.

466
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,769
Now the day is over

467
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,272
Night is drawing nigh

468
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:16,189
Get down!

469
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:21,987
The shadows of the evening
steal across the sky

470
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:26,074
- I said get the fuck down!
- Now the darkness gathers

471
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,661
- Facedown -- let's go!
- Stars begin to peep

472
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,790
birds and beasts and
flowers

473
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,377
soon will be asleep

474
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,467
What else do you want to
put in the concoction?

475
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,677
Gummi bears.

476
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,472
How do you two plan to eat that,
spread it on toast?

477
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,682
It already has toast in it.

478
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,268
So it does.

479
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,563
Keep mashing.
I'll get the door.

480
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,195
Oh. Hey, there, big guy.

481
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,198
Uh, Dexter, right?

482
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,283
Paul, hi. Rita's not here.

483
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:11,161
Oh, that's okay.
I'm actually here for the kids.

484
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,081
I came to dazzle
them with my booty.

485
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,583
This booty.

486
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:21,379
This is awkward.
I'm afraid I'm not comfortable

487
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,298
letting you inside the
house without Rita here.

488
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,969
Who are you, anyway,
like, the babysitter?

489
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,888
I'm watching the
kids right now,

490
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,474
so I suppose that makes
me the babysitter.

491
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,688
Are you fucking my wife?

492
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,483
I'll let Rita know
you stopped by.

493
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,277
Or I could just walk in.
It's my house.

494
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:47,197
I own this place.
I bet she didn't tell you that, did she?

495
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,574
Homeowner issues are
way over my head.

496
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,786
I should probably just call the police,
let them sort this out.

497
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,383
Is that it?

498
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,176
Yeah.

499
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,679
Yeah, why don't you...

500
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,391
give those presents
to my little buckets of sunshine,

501
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,393
tell Rita she can reach
me at the Motor Court?

502
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,769
Okay.

503
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,691
He might be a crack-addled,
wife-abusing yahoo,

504
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,360
but he refuses to
abandon his kids.

505
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,364
I'm not sure that's
a good thing.

506
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,874
Take him on in.
I'll be right there.

507
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:39,666
You got it.

508
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,086
Congratulations. You
just brought down

509
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,672
the most notorious serial
killer in Florida history.

510
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,091
Fucking "a." He's in
booking right now.

511
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,471
It sucks you weren't
a part of this.

512
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:55,265
I mean, you and me --
we paved the way for this, right?

513
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:58,059
I'm cool.
I've got my own bad guy.

514
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,189
Listen, I just picked up
a message from Tony Tucci.

515
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:05,358
Our favorite fun-loving amputee's
getting out of the hospital.

516
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,777
- There's a party tonight.
- No, thanks.

517
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,196
I don't want to go, either.

518
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,865
But the guy lost body parts, and we
get to tell him we caught the guy.

519
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,659
- What else you got going on?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

520
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,495
There will be hookers there.

521
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,875
All right. Fine, Mr.
grumpy head. Have it your way.

522
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,879
Did he threaten you?

523
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,884
No. Nothing like that.
He was just marking his territory.

524
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,762
Fucking bastard.

525
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,473
Only you could make
those words cute.

526
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,391
Stop it.

527
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,065
Paul said he owns this house.
Is that true?

528
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:49,194
Yeah. Yeah.

529
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,779
I think he got it
in a drug trade.

530
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:58,078
- Dex, what am I gonna do?
- I'd start by getting a divorce.

531
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,665
God, this is such a mess,
and I've dragged you into it.

532
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,794
There, there.

533
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,382
I just wish --
I just wish he'd go away.

534
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,176
Why can't he just go away
and disappear forever?

535
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,762
He can do that --

536
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,057
very easily.

537
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,969
Oh, shit. Fuck.

538
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,891
- We -- we need to talk.
- Yeah.

539
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:04,978
Just let me grab my heart
up off the fucking floor.

540
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,981
Holy fuck, Rita. Whew.

541
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,983
Come on in.

542
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,778
Uh, no.
No, I'm good right here.

543
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,363
Aw, come on.

544
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,657
Don't be that way. Come on in.

545
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,576
I got a six-pack
chilling in the cooler.

546
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:22,871
No. No more.

547
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,166
What?

548
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,294
No more surprise
visits to the house,

549
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:32,088
no more intimidating my friends,
and especially

550
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,757
no more Disney dad.

551
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:37,677
You lost your right to be a father when
you beat your children's mother.

552
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,597
If you want to get to
know Astor and Cody,

553
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,474
you're gonna have to
work for that privilege.

554
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,893
Whoa, whoa, babe,
can I get a word in here?

555
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:49,064
No. Divorce papers.

556
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,191
They're the ones you
refused to sign in prison.

557
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,362
Sign them now, and I'll agree to
supervised visits twice a week.

558
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,365
Show me you can do that for six months,
and then maybe --

559
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,576
maybe -- I'll think about
a nonsupervised schedule.

560
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,287
Is this some kind
of joke, Rita?

561
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,084
You think you can really
make me back down?

562
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,961
No, I don't.

563
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,089
But what else am I gonna do, Paul?

564
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,674
A judge put me in control.

565
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,385
I'm in control now,

566
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:22,097
and I have the power to make sure
you never see your children again

567
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,057
unless you do exactly
as I tell you.

568
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,771
Goddamn, you are fine
when you're mad.

569
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,773
I love the new you.

570
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:35,068
I do. My ass is yours to kick.

571
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,487
I deserve it. Here -- look.

572
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:41,783
Rita, I'm a changed man,
and I swear to God --

573
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:44,577
I am going to prove it to you.

574
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,666
All right. There she is.

575
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,671
Anybody bring any popcorn?

576
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,385
You got him.

577
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,473
Both of them.

578
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,894
- Where's Perry's lawyer?
- He waived the right.

579
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,689
I can't hear a thing.
Who's got the remote?

580
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:18,987
There they are --
my two colleagues...

581
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,656
...technically speaking.

582
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,493
Thankfully, one of
them's a fraud.

583
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:29,080
..because you assume that.
So you can assume I killed them.

584
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,374
You can assume anything that you want.

585
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,792
The doer

586
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:37,672
is merely a fiction that's
added to the deed -- the deed.

587
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,468
The deed is everything.

588
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,681
At least I hope he's a fraud.

589
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:52,395
Whoa! Here's to my new hand.

590
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,773
Some say bravery

591
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,275
is being the only one
who knows you're afraid.

592
00:37:57,484 --> 00:38:00,278
But I've worked with a lot of amputees,
and I got to say --

593
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,198
I don't think tony
knew he was afraid.

594
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:06,159
Here's to one crazy bastard.

595
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,870
Kiss my atrophied ass.

596
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,291
- Now for the main event.
- Medical marijuana?

597
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,794
You wish.

598
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,880
Can you, uh, help me out here, Rudy?

599
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,174
Whoo!

600
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:26,179
Look at that shit.
Half human, half machine.

601
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,972
But all man, baby.

602
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,686
I got it.

603
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,566
Yeah.

604
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,070
May I have this dance?

605
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,988
Hey, buddy, you might have
a chance with me, after all.

606
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,866
Oh, don't worry. There's still
plenty enough of me to go around.

607
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,081
So, you made that
hand and foot?

608
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:53,873
Mm-hmm.

609
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,084
You did a good thing.

610
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:01,089
Tony lost a piece of himself,
and I helped him find it.

611
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:04,384
I mean, how often in life do
you get to make someone whole?

612
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,095
I wouldn't know.

613
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,973
It's like living art -- what you do.

614
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,975
It's funny you should
say that, because

615
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,185
before I turned to prosthetics,
I, uh,

616
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,480
studied the human form at the
university of Paris -- Sorbonne.

617
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,692
- Really?
- Yeah.

618
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,488
- Have you had dinner yet?
- I would love to.

619
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,493
Uh, I thought I'd come
and show my support.

620
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,496
- Bad timing?
- No. No.

621
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,666
Um, have some
champagne, sergeant.

622
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:45,174
See, we got blogs.
We got podcasts.

623
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,759
You know,
the information won't stop.

624
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,679
It comes into your head
and bleeds out your eyes,

625
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,181
and it's all crap, you know?

626
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:56,269
See, you got to
dare for greatness

627
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,563
these days to get
people's attention.

628
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,772
Hmm.

629
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,568
Mm-hmm. Did I get yours?

630
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,077
Ohh. This is worse
than foreplay.

631
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,163
Why doesn't she ask
him any questions?

632
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:19,083
I have no idea what she's doing,
but my patience is wearing thin.

633
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,797
I gave Jeremy a chance,
and he blew it.

634
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,177
Is this one going to
disappoint me, too?

635
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,973
That's an interesting
interview technique.

636
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,893
I'm tired of asking questions.

637
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,687
You're getting off on
this too fucking much.

638
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,565
- Getting off on what?
- The game.

639
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,485
I'm guessing that's why you
didn't request a lawyer --

640
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,696
so you can sit here and say
whatever shit comes into your head.

641
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,573
Meanwhile, my ass is
spreading like cheez whiz,

642
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,867
waiting for you to figure
out this isn't the fun part.

643
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,662
What are you talking about?

644
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,583
We got you dead to rights.

645
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:05,088
But the good times won't start
rolling till you're in a courtroom

646
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,966
with your own
personal judge Ito

647
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:14,263
and Court TV carrying your scary-ass
scowls and crazy-shit live.

648
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,267
Fascination with serial
killers is an american pastime.

649
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,896
You've got groupie housewives,
magazine profiles,

650
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,857
maybe even a summer
blockbuster movie...

651
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,068
All waiting for you.

652
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,156
But the feeding frenzy won't
start till you throw out the chum.

653
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,660
Until then,
I'm just gonna chill.

654
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:40,790
You're right.

655
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,169
Yeah. This isn't the fun part.

656
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,968
The fun part...

657
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,971
was hanging them like cattle.

658
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,180
Hanging who?

659
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:00,977
The hookers...

660
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,688
Right before I cut their throats.

661
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:04,897
Son of a bitch.

662
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:08,067
I used gravity roots to
hang them upside down

663
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,695
to drain the blood. Then...

664
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,072
That shit is privileged.
The press never got ahold of that.

665
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,491
..I'd pour in liquid
nitrogen to freeze the blood

666
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,577
before I cut them into nice,

667
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,163
clean pieces.

668
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,372
Yes.

669
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:24,459
See, you got to understand --
I hate blood.

670
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:26,669
And there it is --

671
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,173
all the expectations I had,

672
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,676
all the promises of
greatness wiped out.

673
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,263
My circle of friends
is down to one.

674
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,776
How -- what are you doing here?
Are you a cop?

675
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:51,778
The cameras are off.
I have one minute.

676
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,489
Tell me why. I need to know.

677
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,074
- Why what?
- Don't!

678
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:01,996
You killed again.
I told you -- I warned you --

679
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:05,374
don't kill anyone who
doesn't deserve to die.

680
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,877
Why did you do it?

681
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,590
- To feel something different.

682
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,469
- Different than what?

683
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,556
What do you normally feel?

684
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,068
Nothing. Fucking
nothing at all.

685
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,779
I te every fucking
goddamn second of it.

686
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,990
I can't stand it --
living my life in my head.

687
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,174
Does killing make it better?

688
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,178
No.

689
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,681
Worse.

690
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:05,059
Fucking worse than ever.

691
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:08,980
Put your hands on the table.

692
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,275
Do it.

693
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,283
I'm a lot like you, you know?

694
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,077
Yeah, right. You're a killer?

695
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,875
I'm empty...

696
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:37,091
..but I found a way to make
it feel less bottomless.

697
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,473
- How?
- Pretend.

698
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,185
You pretend the feelings
are there for the world

699
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,188
and for the people around you.

700
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,359
Who knows?
Maybe one day they will be.

701
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,695
What the hell are
you doing, Morgan?

702
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,572
I'm scraping under the nails for blood.
Almost done.

703
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:00,573
Get out.

704
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:04,076
I want 10 more minutes with this
piece of shit before his lawyer shows.

705
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:08,873
Stand up!

706
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,376
Living my life in my head --

707
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,670
I know exactly
what Jeremy means.

708
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,089
At least I had
someone to talk to --

709
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,884
Harry, my foster father.

710
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:23,262
He spent endless hours
teaching me how to survive.

711
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:25,681
Excuse me,
are you Jeremy Downs' lawyer?

712
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,683
Yes, I am.
I'm just heading over to see him.

713
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:28,893
Sooner would be better.

714
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,980
- Seriously.
- Thank you.

715
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:44,075
My mom died when I was 16 --
cancer --

716
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:48,496
and then it was just me,
my brother, my dad.

717
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,582
- You have a brother?
- Yeah. Dexter.

718
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,876
He and my dad were
really tight.

719
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,878
They were always
spending time together.

720
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,172
I guess I was jealous.

721
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,175
What, you mean you weren't
daddy's little girl?

722
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:04,095
No, I was, kind of.

723
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,181
He just took a special interest in Dex,
you know?

724
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,558
I think that's why I became a cop.
That's what he was.

725
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:13,270
I thought maybe he would give
me more attention or something.

726
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:16,357
- And did he?
- Not really...

727
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,277
But we had our moments.

728
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,656
What about you?
How'd you become...

729
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,492
Captain hook?

730
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:31,580
Well, when I was little,
my mom got in a car accident,

731
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,290
and she lost both her legs.

732
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:35,793
That's terrible.

733
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,671
I remember when it happened,

734
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:41,382
I just wanted to put
her back together...

735
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:44,385
You know, like humpty-dumpty,

736
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:48,681
just the pieces weren't around.

737
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,959
I'm going to miss my playmate.

738
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:24,592
Sure, there's Rita and the kids,
but they don't know the real me.

739
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,762
They can never
know the real me.

740
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,183
And now the father is back.

741
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,187
Things have changed.

742
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,858
Everything has changed.

743
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:48,282
I always prided myself on
being an outsider, but now...

744
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,580
I feel the need to
connect with someone.

745
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:01,796
I saw myself in Jeremy...

746
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,466
But instead of helping
him like Harry helped me,

747
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:09,178
I gave him a piece of fortune-cookie
advice that he never even heard.

748
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,097
I failed him.

749
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,475
He deserves better...

750
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,561
And he'll get it from now on.

751
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,962
I guess I was wrong.

752
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:47,383
Jeremy did hear my advice.

753
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,470
He killed someone
who deserved to die.

754
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,558
What's the status on Perry?

755
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,268
I'm having him
transferred right now.

756
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,979
The D.A. wants to keep him at county,
pending arraignment.

757
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:03,566
Maria,

758
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:07,778
it was your decision making that
led to his capture and arrest,

759
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:12,992
and you made all our lives easier
by getting the bastard to confess.

760
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,160
I'm just doing my job.

761
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:17,788
It feels good to be
praising your police work

762
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,665
instead of your
politics for a change.

763
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,170
We need to make an
official comment.

764
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,963
Don't worry.
I'll keep it short.

765
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:28,757
I'm just heading downstairs
now for the press conference.

766
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,092
The press conference is over.

767
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,471
Oh, and, uh, don't worry.
I kept it short.

768
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,058
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

769
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:41,187
- That was my bust.
- This is my department.

770
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,984
Did you at least
give me credit?

771
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:50,779
Yes. I just gave it to you.
Haven't you been listening?

772
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,457
Ever since Harry's death,
I've been alone...

773
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:08,088
...but now,
for the first time...

774
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:11,091
I feel alone.

775
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,385
How long you need
with the prisoner?

776
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,392
As long as I can get.

777
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:24,271
Jeremy is gone,
and Neil Perry will soon vanish

778
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,273
into the catacombs
of the system.

779
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,276
I have so many
questions for him.

780
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:32,988
How did he discover my secrets?

781
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,658
What was his message to me?

782
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:41,664
He's been in my home,
my photos...

783
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:44,166
my life.

784
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,460
He knows me.

785
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:49,880
Now I need to know him...

786
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,265
...to connect face-to-face

787
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,060
before he's beyond
my reach forever.

788
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,490
Hi.

789
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,787
Who the fuck are you?
