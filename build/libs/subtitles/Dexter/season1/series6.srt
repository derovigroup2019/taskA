1
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,313
<i>Previously on "Dexter"...</i>

2
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,733
<i>No blood --</i>
What a beautiful idea.

3
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:52,237
Brother, I just found
the fucking ice-truck.

4
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,994
<i>It is my new friend.</i>

5
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,831
<i>When he broke into my apartment,</i>
he took some time to get to know me --

6
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,418
<i>My life, my secrets.</i>

7
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,004
Paul doesn't live here anymore.

8
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,299
No shit.
He's in jail. But...

9
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,926
See, he still owes me
for two ounces of blow,

10
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,470
which means you owe me.

11
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,014
The coyote wanted more money,
and I didn't have it.

12
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:19,931
Poor bastards --

13
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,601
Spend their life savings,
get stuffed into a fishhold.

14
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,520
- They can't pay...
- They disappear.

15
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,897
<i>Jorge Castillo --</i>

16
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,566
<i>The only suspect even remotely
close to the park</i>

17
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,985
<i>where Yelina was supposed
to drop the money.</i>

18
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,488
Excuse me.
Private yard.

19
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,574
Sorry, I just assumed
you were Cuban.

20
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,244
American, pal,
just like you.

21
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:46,625
Just like me.

22
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,001
Co?o.
Come on.

23
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,546
Get back in there,
you Cuban piece of shit.

24
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,341
<i>They're even better-matched
than I thought.</i>

25
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,302
Fucking animals.

26
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,888
God bless America.

27
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:09,398
<i>Taking the extra time to kill Valerie
may have been ill-advised.</i>

28
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:13,402
<i>My life has always been a sequence
of carefully planned moments.</i>

29
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,822
<i>But sometimes you just have
to take a risk.</i>

30
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,842
<i>Life is so fleeting,
so fragile.</i>

31
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,971
<i>Every breath the potential
to be our last.</i>

32
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,266
You ready?

33
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,361
Can I have
my cereal now?

34
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,405
<i>We all grieve in our own way.</i>

35
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,614
Sure.

36
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,452
<i>I prefer the 6-year-old
approach.</i>

37
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,496
<i>Yet another I've sent
to a watery grave.</i>

38
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,499
<i>Well, not quite.</i>

39
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,633
Hey, what about this one?

40
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,677
I want angel cake.

41
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:24,014
It's angel food, stupid,
and you don't get a vote.

42
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,224
- It's my birthday.
- Guys.

43
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,813
So how'd it go?

44
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:35,442
Bob the goldfish --
May he rest in peace.

45
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,487
Thanks for coming over and
taking care of this for me.

46
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,738
Dead stuff...

47
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,323
I know.

48
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,909
Well, go have a seat.

49
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,995
Your treat for coming over early
is on its way.

50
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:54,294
<i>I don't get birthdays --
The party, the song.</i>

51
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,590
<i>Celebrating another year
just being alive feels... forced.</i>

52
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,303
That one!
That's the one I want.

53
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,807
- Coconut it is.
- I hate coconut.

54
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,975
You've never had coconut.

55
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,646
It's dispatch.

56
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,981
I might have to
settle for toast to go.

57
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,107
Morgan.

58
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,279
Sure, what's the location?

59
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,868
I'll be right there.

60
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,672
<i>The crime scene.</i>

61
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,758
<i>My crime scene.</i>

62
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:06,324
<i>I shouldn't have killed them both.
I didn't have enough time.</i>

63
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,370
<i>A footprint, a microscopic
drop of blood --</i>

64
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,456
<i>What did I leave behind?</i>

65
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,893
<i>Impossible.</i>

66
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,732
Nice place setting, huh?
We're running her prints now.

67
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,610
<i>It had to be him.
He's watching me.</i>

68
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,527
Dex?

69
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,824
Good.
I.D. the victim.

70
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,582
You find anything else?

71
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,125
That ain't enough?

72
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,793
Any eyewitnesses?

73
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,920
Just do your job.
Worry about the blood.

74
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,091
You gonna answer that?

75
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,723
This tin can smells like ass.
The sooner you get busy,

76
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,017
the sooner we can finger
who did this.

77
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,478
You heard the man.

78
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,370
<i>He dove 100 feet
to bring up the body.</i>

79
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:38,083
<i>He's getting back at me for
not killing that security guard.</i>

80
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,711
Please tell me this wasn't
the ice-truck killer.

81
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,755
I've got the press sniffing
outside already.

82
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,383
- No, it's not his M.O.
- We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

83
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,760
And guess this. Her husband,
Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

84
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,261
Then, try and
track him down.

85
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,180
Sir, we found something.

86
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,522
You got anything?

87
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,357
No bruising.

88
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,484
Nothing under her nails.

89
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,653
She didn't put up a fight.

90
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,781
If she was killed here,
which I doubt,

91
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,741
whoever did it was a real pro.

92
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,786
<i>Under normal circumstances,
I'd take that as a compliment.</i>

93
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,746
- Prints?
- She's clean.

94
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,708
This trailer --
That's another matter.

95
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:24,087
I don't even want to know
what some of those stains are.

96
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,842
Yo, Dex, I think
I found something.

97
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,677
Zoom in on this, will you?

98
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,889
- I'm kind of low on batteries here.
- Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

99
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,561
Yo, what's up with you today?
You're throwing off my Chi.

100
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,272
- You're not Chinese.
- I'm not?

101
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,399
Look, right here.

102
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,611
Does that look like
a needle mark to you?

103
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,867
It's more like a bug bite,
blemish maybe.

104
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,830
Yeah...
I guess.

105
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,501
I'll let the
coroner bag her.

106
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,712
I'm hungry.

107
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,186
This ain't no auto garage.

108
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,732
Oh! Oh, god.
Oh, I didn't need to see that.

109
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,401
You never seen
a latrine before, Morgan?

110
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,320
Yeah, just not indoors.

111
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,447
Well, the army taught me
a lot of things.

112
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,824
I feel a Desert Storm story
coming on.

113
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:38,119
Digging holes for people to take
a dump? That was most important.

114
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,913
I'm not really getting that.

115
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,165
It doesn't matter how many bars
you got on your collar, Morgan.

116
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,542
- Everybody's shit stinks.
- Here we go.

117
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,337
- We were partners a long time.
- From the looks of things,

118
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,215
Valerie Castillo's better half
was knee-deep.

119
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,134
- You like the husband for this?
- It's always the husband.

120
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,931
What have you got?

121
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,850
It looks like a phone number
and a name -- Mariel.

122
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,728
Call it in to Batista.
He can run it down for us.

123
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,355
Sergeant Doakes!

124
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,357
We heard movement
in the trunk.

125
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,859
I got it.
I got it.

126
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,407
Padre nuestro
que est? en los cielos.

127
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,535
Santificado sea tu nombre.
Venga tu reino.

128
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,286
H?gase tu voluntad
en la tierra...

129
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,705
You all right, kid?
Come on, man.

130
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,665
No!

131
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,501
Subtle.
Maybe you should cuff him.

132
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,256
Mi hijito, todo est? bien.
Te vamos a ayudar.

133
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,737
<i>The noose is tightening.</i>

134
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,994
<i>This is how it ends -- In the
hands of a 7-year-old?</i>

135
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,161
Hey, Deb.

136
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,205
<i>I usually like kids.</i>

137
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,790
Who's the boy?

138
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,625
All we got so far
is that he's Cuban

139
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,210
and he seems to
like Laguerta.

140
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,587
Spend enough time
in a hot trunk,

141
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,505
I guess she'd look
good to anybody.

142
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,260
Did he... you know?
see anything?

143
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,554
I'm not sure.
He's pretty out of it.

144
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,723
Social services is on the way.

145
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,977
You okay? You got a whole
brow thing going on.

146
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,104
Morgan, bring some water!

147
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,481
I love her.

148
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,485
Maybe I should spend some time
in a hot trunk, too.

149
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:38,573
<i>My neat little world of lies is
crumbling all around me,</i>

150
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,825
<i>and I can't tell a soul,</i>

151
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,244
<i>especially not Deb.</i>

152
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:48,958
- Deb, we've been through this.
- But I have my books. I mean,

153
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,919
I could just stay
in the car...

154
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,754
...or I can walk
with you guys.

155
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,381
I promise I'll be quiet.
You won't even know I'm there.

156
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,008
The pheasants will know
you're there.

157
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,844
- But Dexter was my age when --
- Deb, that's enough.

158
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,847
The Logans are waiting.
Did you pack your swimsuit?

159
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,726
- Yes.
- Good girl.

160
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,479
I want to see that backflip
when we come home.

161
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,898
All right. Go on out to the car.
We'll be there in a sec.

162
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,112
She does kind of
have a point, dad.

163
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,366
What we do on these weekends your
sister can never know about.

164
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:26,746
Keeping the truth from the people
closest to you is how you'll survive...

165
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,333
...and how you'll protect them
if anything ever goes wrong.

166
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,638
Guys, hurry up. You're gonna
be late for school.

167
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,225
I'm headed to the store. Is there
anything else you want for your party?

168
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,519
Balloons aren't much of a list.

169
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:53,564
It's okay. It don't need that
other stuff. It's too expensive.

170
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,859
How about you let me worry
about that stuff, okay?

171
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,487
It's your party. You can have
whatever you want.

172
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,788
- Hello?
- Hey, babe, it's me.

173
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,499
Go wait in the car.

174
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,378
What's wrong with mom?

175
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,381
She only gets that way when
she's talking to dad.

176
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,969
Hi.

177
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:27,098
I was able to track down that name Mariel
with the number that you called in.

178
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,725
She's a
Cuban refugee.

179
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,436
She's staying with cousins.
I had a cop bring her in.

180
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,146
Why scratch the number
in the floor?

181
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,982
Next of kin, in case something
happened to her.

182
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:39,110
Guys like Castillo are ruthless.
They prey on families.

183
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,739
He was holding Mariel and six
others captive at a salvage yard.

184
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,240
That explains the garage.

185
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,242
And if the relatives don't
pay the release fee,

186
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,411
the coyote would dump
their ass overboard.

187
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,580
Cocksuckers make me sick.
Come on.

188
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,795
Mariel, estos son mis amigos
que yo te dije.

189
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,758
Sargento Doakes y la detective
Morgan. Puede sentar.

190
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,012
Mariel, when was the last time
you saw Jorge Castillo?

191
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,390
?Cu?ndo fue la ultima vez que
t? viste a Jorge Castillo?

192
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:13,269
Cuando me encerr? con los otros
despu?s de bajarnos del barco.

193
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,646
When he locked her and the other refugees up

194
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,482
after pulling them
from the boat.

195
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,860
No ten?amos comida ni agua.

196
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,405
Un hombre trat? de escapar.
Jorge lo agarr? y lo golpe?.

197
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,699
They went without
food and water.

198
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:30,161
Some guy tried to escape, but
he was beaten by Jorge.

199
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,455
- How'd she get free?
- ?C?mo escap??

200
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:37,126
Alguien abri? la puerta al garaje.
Y nos escapamos.

201
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,629
Somebody opened the door
to the garage.

202
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,888
Cuando los agarren, espero
que los hagan sufrir mucho,

203
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,558
especialmente esa concha
que nos trat? como perro.

204
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,103
She said, "when we find them,

205
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,397
to make them suffer
for what they did,

206
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,401
especially that concha
that treated her like a dog.

207
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,611
Concha?
Ah, got you.

208
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,530
Fuck me.
The wife was in on it.

209
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,032
Ask if she knows the little boy
social services picked up.

210
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,035
?Y qui?n era el ni?o peque?o
que estaba con usted?

211
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,872
?Qu? ni?o?
Yo nunca vi un ni?o.

212
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,834
She never saw a boy.

213
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:26,634
<i>No hair, no fibers, C.O.D.</i>
exsanguination -- So far, so good.

214
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,427
- You're hovering.
- Keep reading.

215
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,179
- What am I looking for?
- Wait for it.

216
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,431
This is a prelim.
I don't have time --

217
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,725
"M" fucking 99.

218
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,854
Etorphine hydrochloride?

219
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,023
An animal tranquilizer more
powerful than morphine.

220
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,526
It causes total paralysis.

221
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,987
That mark on her neck
kept bugging me,

222
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,947
so I ordered up
a tox screen.

223
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,033
<i>That's it. No more doughnuts
for Masuka.</i>

224
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,953
Dude, this stuff is
strictly controlled.

225
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,206
The only way to get it is
with a D.E.A. license.

226
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,835
I put a request in
for the list.

227
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,879
I should have it for Doakes
in the morning.

228
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,339
Nice.

229
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,592
Yeah, baby.

230
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,343
<i>I'm on that list,</i>

231
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,555
<i>and eventually the alias I used
will lead them back to me.</i>

232
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,599
<i>Ticktock.</i>

233
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,858
- Hey, you.
- Thank god you're there.

234
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,568
I really need to talk
with someone.

235
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,237
Everything okay?

236
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:32,033
- Paul called after you left.
- Paul? Who's Paul?

237
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,494
My soon-to-be ex.
He's already out of jail --

238
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,413
Overcrowding.
Can you believe it?

239
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,457
Every time something goes
just a little bit right,

240
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,877
something like this happens.
He wants to come to Astor's party.

241
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,297
- What did you tell him?
- I'd have to think about it.

242
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:50,218
But even if I say "no", he won't
listen. He never does.

243
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,680
Can you --
Can you come over tonight?

244
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,391
I don't know, I'm kind of
under the gun here, big case.

245
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,685
I shouldn't be dumping all this
on you. I'm sorry.

246
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:04,649
No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll
stop by if I can. I promise.

247
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,152
Okay. I'll keep a plate warm
just in case.

248
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,862
Thanks.
Bye.

249
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,700
Check the marinas.
Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

250
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,536
We'll search the house.

251
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:19,872
Where's Laguerta?

252
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,375
Trying to bring that kid in
for a sketch.

253
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,001
Sketch?

254
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,546
He told social services that some
guy saved him from the bad lady.

255
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,216
Valerie Castillo?

256
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,969
It sounds like she got exactly
what she had coming to her.

257
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,930
Personally, I'd shake
this guy's hand.

258
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,932
<i>Yeah, you say that now.</i>

259
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,820
Found his passport.

260
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,030
God...

261
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,491
I feel like I need a shower
just looking at this douche bag.

262
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:56,701
Well, keep searching.

263
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,911
Phone records, bank
accounts, credit cards.

264
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,956
Maybe the wife got greedy,
and that's why he killed her.

265
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,417
Maybe.

266
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,173
This morning at the salvage yard,
what was that thing by the car?

267
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,300
What thing?

268
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:16,137
Before you opened the trunk,
you tried to cockblock me.

269
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,888
I was just looking out
for my team.

270
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,682
I didn't see you looking out
for Laguerta.

271
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,934
- I would if she'd asked.
- I didn't ask.

272
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:22,852
Fine.

273
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,187
Next time,
just get your ass shot.

274
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,819
- It's possible our guy left town.
- If he even did it.

275
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,991
- What if we have a copycat killer?
- That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

276
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,200
Just hear me out.

277
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,536
What if the person who killed
Valerie Castillo was trying

278
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,996
to bleed her out like
the ice-truck killer

279
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,080
but didn't know how?

280
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,290
She wasn't a hooker.

281
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,541
But she was killed
someplace else,

282
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,419
dumped and laid out in a ritualistic
manner, just like all the others.

283
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,503
Except she wasn't in pieces.

284
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,422
But she had cuts
on her neck.

285
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:55,217
I'm just saying, with all the media
coverage on the ice-truck killer,

286
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,345
it's possible.

287
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,472
What do you suggest, Morgan?

288
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,683
Let me work up a profile, just
in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

289
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,686
Fine.
Whatever.

290
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:14,070
That's the second time you've made
that face. Who are you avoiding?

291
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,240
We got one more stop to make.

292
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,251
<i>Nothing lasts forever.</i>

293
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,420
<i>Just ask a Ford Pinto.</i>

294
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,591
<i>Eventually, most serial killers
get caught.</i>

295
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,053
<i>There's really not much
of a retirement plan.</i>

296
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:43,015
<i>But it can't end like this.
It's too soon.</i>

297
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,684
<i>I'm not ready.</i>

298
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,948
<i>He saw me.</i>

299
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,385
What's this?

300
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,805
You've been asking who's been
calling. My mom lives here.

301
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,141
Did you forget your laundry?

302
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,518
She's been on me to stop
by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

303
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,395
And here's the plan.
We go in.

304
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,231
We eat. We out before
the cheesecake. You got it?

305
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,941
I'm, what, your
exit strategy?

306
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,735
Look, you can stay
out here if you want.

307
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,611
That gives me a better excuse
to leave earlier or...

308
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:41,532
...you can come in and have
some free food. It's your call.

309
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,743
Shit!

310
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,079
My sisters are here, too.

311
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,295
Fucking family reunion!

312
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,091
So this john comes out of nowhere.
He's got me by the throat.

313
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,968
I can't reach around
and get my gun

314
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,179
and I see he has
a nipple ring.

315
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,639
I rip that fucker out
like it's a grenade pin.

316
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,724
Morgan!

317
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,809
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

318
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,102
We're used to it.

319
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,397
When James graces his family
with this presence.

320
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,483
Some of us don't work at a bank.

321
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,943
Please, first words out of
my baby brother's mouth were,

322
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,029
"Got milk, motherfucker".

323
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,531
Oh, okay, now, that's enough,
all of you.

324
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,909
That security guard on the news
is gonna be all right?

325
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,703
If someone did a hatchet job
on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

326
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,163
Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

327
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,123
The hospital's setting him up
with some prosthetics.

328
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,044
I don't know, he's just got
this spirit about him.

329
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,545
The guy's missing body parts

330
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,214
because of this
ice-truck killer asshole,

331
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,798
and he's still hitting on me.

332
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:43,511
That's because men only
think with one body part,

333
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,930
and that one was not cut off.

334
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,014
Ma!

335
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,641
Well, it's the damn truth.

336
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,227
Morgan, come on.
We got a case to solve.

337
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,188
Oh, are you sure, honey? I got
some cheesecake in the fridge.

338
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,607
Yeah.
We're sure.

339
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:57,900
You know...

340
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,070
I would love
some cheesecake bit.

341
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,614
You can wait in the car.
That's your call.

342
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,825
He'll wait.

343
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,077
- I'll do the dishes.
- I'll help you.

344
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,162
Ooh, I'm sorry.

345
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,417
<i>I wonder, in time,
if they'll even remember me,</i>

346
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,796
<i>other than the man who broke
their mother's heart.</i>

347
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,590
<i>I'll be breaking
their hearts, too.</i>

348
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,301
He is their father.

349
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,012
They have a right to know
he's been released, right?

350
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,100
Yeah, sure.

351
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:35,354
Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come,
he'll show up here eventually.

352
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,231
I know him.

353
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,234
Everything's been going
so good at work...

354
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:41,986
With you.

355
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:44,989
I don't know what to do.

356
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,950
He's really got a hold on you,
doesn't he?

357
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:53,914
Paul always had a temper,
but when he was using...

358
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,333
He said if I...

359
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:59,128
...left, he would find
us and hurt the kids.

360
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,215
Somehow, I thought that by staying,
I was protecting them.

361
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,220
Cody doesn't remember
the worst of it, but...

362
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,055
Astor...

363
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,435
She was the one who called
the police the last time.

364
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,021
She was protecting me.

365
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,316
You're not that
woman anymore.

366
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,234
You're stronger
than that now.

367
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,322
If their dad shows up,
we'll deal with it together.

368
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,700
Dad's coming home?

369
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,876
Can he sleep in my room, mom?
Can he, mom?

370
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,544
<i>I shouldn't even be here.</i>

371
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,505
<i>Rita will be devastated
if I'm arrested.</i>

372
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,550
<i>Her husband was a crackhead,
her boyfriend's a serial killer.</i>

373
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,802
<i>It's kind of hard not
to take that personally.</i>

374
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,853
Better get inside, son.
Storm's on its way.

375
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,937
Why didn't you tell me
what you are, Dex?

376
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,009
Any last words?

377
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,011
Figures.

378
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,612
<i>I don't have
bad dreams.</i>

379
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,490
<i>When I sleep,
all of me sleeps.</i>

380
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,160
<i>Nothing ever goes bump
in Dexter's night.</i>

381
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,335
<i>I've never felt a
moment of remorse,</i>

382
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:48,297
<i>doubt,
regret.</i>

383
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,219
<i>What's happening to me?</i>

384
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,059
<i>If my back wasn't against
the wall, I'd almost feel guilty</i>

385
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,312
<i>for hacking into
Masuka's e-mail.</i>

386
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,607
<i>Once I got past all the porn,
it was easy.</i>

387
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,612
<i>And there I am.</i>

388
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:16,909
<i>Dr. Patrick Bateman --
So wholesome, so inconspicuous.</i>

389
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,078
<i>Harry would frown upon
destroying evidence,</i>

390
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,039
<i>but he never wanted me
to get caught, either.</i>

391
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,832
What are you doing in here?

392
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,584
My computer went down.

393
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,336
I was just checking some e-mail.

394
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,965
Can you take a look
at this for me?

395
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,511
Copycat killer?

396
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,262
I worked all night
on that profile.

397
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,390
I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but
I want to make sure it's good enough.

398
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,476
I'm honored.

399
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,732
"The similar manner in which the victim's
body was displayed suggests this killer

400
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:52,069
"feels a connection
to the ice-truck killer,

401
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,947
"excited by what he's doing.

402
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,538
"The cut on the victim's cheek,
while not fatal,

403
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,915
"appears to be
a signature of sorts.

404
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,752
"Because of the lack of evidence
collected from the crime scene,

405
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,504
"the suspect may be familiar

406
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:13,590
"with law enforcement
or forensics procedure."

407
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,429
Why'd you quit? You're getting
to the good stuff.

408
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,514
Let me guess --

409
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,349
Single white male, mid-30s,
lives alone,

410
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,434
disconnected
from his emotions.

411
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,064
It's a little textbook,
don't you think?

412
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,150
But it totally fits this case.

413
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,026
You're trying to make it fit.

414
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,990
My advice?

415
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,825
Keep this to yourself.

416
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,120
Really?

417
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,581
Deb, you're new to Homicide.
This blows up in your face,

418
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,957
you've given
Laguerta the excuse

419
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,501
she's been looking for
to send you back to Vice.

420
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:57,801
No.

421
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,429
I'm on to something here.
I feel it.

422
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,973
Like one of your hunches.

423
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,812
Way to have my back.

424
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,321
Where's your sister?

425
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,244
Debra! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

426
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,708
How did you get into my cabinet?

427
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,710
You hide the
key in the pantry...

428
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,503
...on the top shelf.

429
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,756
You and your brother know

430
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,174
never

431
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,469
to touch my guns unless
it's under my direct supervision.

432
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,596
But I was being really careful!
I mean,

433
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,848
I was only shooting at
the cans and the bottles.

434
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,683
And I'm really good,
like Dexter,

435
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,269
and now we can all
go hunting together.

436
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,396
I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

437
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,649
Grab your things.

438
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,032
Thanks a lot.

439
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,372
Starting this morning, we have
cadets from the academy

440
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,916
going over every inch
of the salvage yard.

441
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,584
Those days I don't miss.

442
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:13,794
The kid we found yesterday

443
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,213
saw someone abduct Valerie
Castillo from that yard.

444
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,299
Because he didn't recognize
a photo of Jorge Castillo,

445
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:22,844
Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing
him in to attempt a sketch.

446
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,891
Come on, sweetheart.

447
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,768
Let's take the seatbelt off.

448
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,937
There you go.
Come on.

449
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,730
Come on, sweetheart.

450
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,899
You want to go inside
to see the nice lady?

451
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,068
Come on, sweetie.
Let's go.

452
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,363
Thanks for bringing him by.

453
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,412
Hola, Oscar.

454
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,748
?T? quieres venir conmigo?

455
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,003
Normally, I wouldn't approve
of something like this,

456
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,046
but you've made
quite an impression.

457
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,758
You have kids?

458
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,593
No.

459
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,014
I was like him once --

460
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,141
A stranger in a strange place,

461
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,643
left to grow up
with strangers,

462
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,729
all for a better life.

463
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,983
Well, police lieutenant --
I'd say you've done okay.

464
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:23,405
- Any luck with the family?
- No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

465
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,073
He just uses the first name.

466
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,117
Maybe we'll have
some luck on our end.

467
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:28,660
I hope so.

468
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,705
I hate to send another one
of these kids into foster care.

469
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,000
Thank you.

470
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,877
Bye, sweetheart.

471
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,131
Meanwhile, we'll follow
up on the D.E.A. list

472
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,758
of M-99 buyers.

473
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,801
That would include
vets, doctors,

474
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:48,263
animal control, even circuses.

475
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,640
Be thorough.
Check everyone.

476
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,436
Masuka, what do we have on
the home and the boat?

477
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,146
Still processing, sir.

478
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,065
If it turns up the husband
is a dead end,

479
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,609
then we're looking at
a new suspect, folks.

480
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:01,777
Morgan.

481
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,612
Any ideas?

482
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,489
<i>Don't do it, Deb.</i>

483
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:06,990
<i>The last thing
I need right now</i>

484
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,618
<i>is to be profiled for
all of Miami metro.</i>

485
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,703
We could be looking at
someone who's inspired

486
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:13,955
by the ice-truck killer.
A copycat.

487
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:17,542
If so, the suspect is probably
familiar with forensic procedures.

488
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,295
I have a profile. I'd be happy
to show it to you.

489
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,047
I'll be in my lab.

490
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,384
Hello, Dex.

491
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,145
Oscar...

492
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:42,943
?El hombre que viste era
como yo o m?s delgado?

493
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,990
Mi hijito, est? bien.
Cu?ntanos.

494
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,701
Cu?ntanos lo que
t? viste esa noche.

495
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,543
- I'll be right back.
- No!

496
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,475
Est? bien,
me quedo aqu?.

497
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,653
I forgot how much I loved
pastelitos growing up.

498
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,573
He just needed
a little reminder of home.

499
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,617
I was barely his age when I came
over with my family.

500
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,036
I threw up
the whole damn way.

501
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:37,831
?Quieres m?s?

502
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,668
?Cinco?

503
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,881
Go get the artist. I think
somebody's ready.

504
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,757
Save me some.

505
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,052
No, dice que no.

506
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:54,639
Cinco no puede.
Pero tres, s?.

507
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,226
- No es 5, es 10.
- ?10?

508
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:01,813
Te digo que t? hablas con el se?or
cuando el venga, y entonces,

509
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,900
s?, yo te doy 10,
lo que t? quieras. 20.

510
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,902
30.

511
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,321
- 50?
- 50.

512
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:21,917
Did you thank Mrs. Carrol

513
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,668
for picking you up
from school for me?

514
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,337
Yes.

515
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,930
So, what do you think?

516
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,518
Everything okay?

517
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,020
You want to talk out it?

518
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,398
Holly, Blake, and Ashley said
they can't come to my party.

519
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:46,900
Honey, that's not true.

520
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,610
I spoke with their moms last week.

521
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,111
It's all Cody's fault.

522
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:53,114
He couldn't keep his mouth shut
about dad getting out of jail.

523
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,243
- Did not!
- You told everyone!

524
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,712
<i>I have to know.</i>

525
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,220
Dexter...

526
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,306
Thank god.

527
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,141
My arm's asleep.

528
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,103
How long have you
two been like this?

529
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,813
Half an hour.

530
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,565
I was afraid I'd wake him
if I moved.

531
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:32,112
At that age, when they're out,
they're out.

532
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,199
You could brush his teeth,
and he wouldn't wake up.

533
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,412
Here. Lift up his head.
I'll slide this underneath.

534
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,306
Oh, thanks.

535
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,435
What are you doing here?

536
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:07,647
I'm waiting on some lab work.
I had some time to kill.

537
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:12,652
Go ahead. We didn't get very far.
He's so tired.

538
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,155
We're gonna pick it up
again tomorrow.

539
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,991
It's only a matter of time

540
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,910
before we know what
this little guy saw.

541
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,405
If you, um... here.

542
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,201
You want help or not?

543
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,914
I have a hair or something
stuck on my lens.

544
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,165
Luckily, you're in good hands.

545
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,709
I traded my glasses in for
contacts in high school.

546
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,044
Boys?

547
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,296
Yeah. What I really
needed was tits.

548
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,007
I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras
until I was 16. As you can see,

549
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,301
- not a whole lot's changed since then.
- Morgan.

550
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,136
Try not to blink, okay?

551
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,224
Okay, okay.
I'll do it.

552
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,850
I'll do it.

553
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,020
Let me ask you something.

554
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,147
Your brother's adopted,
right?

555
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,608
Yeah, my dad found him
at a crime scene.

556
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,944
How did the department
feel about Harry getting...

557
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,821
personally involved in a case?

558
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,573
It didn't seem to be a problem.
My parents never talked about it much.

559
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,868
Oh, but still, raising a boy,
it's a lot of work, no?

560
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,204
Dex?
God, no.

561
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,207
I got in more trouble than he did.
He was the perfect one.

562
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,625
Here, I think I see it.

563
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,880
There's the bastard.

564
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,593
Thanks.

565
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,726
Let me ask you a question.

566
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,563
Why do you have it in for me?

567
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,858
You're loud,
you're impulsive, and

568
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,068
you constantly
question authority.

569
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,904
Fair enough.

570
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:24,826
I hear you have an
interesting theory on --

571
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,302
Honey, what is it?

572
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:52,645
Sweetie.

573
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,231
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

574
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,859
It's all right.
These things happen.

575
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,695
Go get changed,
and I'll fix the bed.

576
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,705
Mommy?

577
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,626
Is it okay if
I didn't have my party?

578
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:50,370
<i>It's only a matter of time
before that boy finishes telling</i>

579
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,997
<i>the police who he saw that
night at the salvage yard --</i>

580
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,958
<i>Me.</i>

581
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,461
<i>Once the sketch is finished,
there will be no place left to hide.</i>

582
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:03,341
<i>If I want any chance of survival,
I have to get rid of it all.</i>

583
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,010
<i>I have to let go.</i>

584
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,675
<i>Alex Timmons --
Sniper.</i>

585
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:51,222
<i>Yes, I did it. Is that
what you want to hear?</i>

586
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,269
<i>Gene Marshall --
Arsonist.</i>

587
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,105
<i>Have you ever watched
someone burned alive?</i>

588
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,902
<i>Cindy Landon --
Black widow.</i>

589
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,738
I'll fuck you
if you let me go.

590
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,407
<i>Such fond memories of them all.</i>

591
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,201
<i>They all accepted their fate
in their own way.</i>

592
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,371
<i>Now it's time for me
to do the same.</i>

593
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,583
<i>Valerie Castillo --
My last victim.</i>

594
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:31,554
<i>He's not angry. That's not
what this is about.</i>

595
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,514
<i>He's testing me.</i>

596
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,394
<i>I was wrong
the whole time.</i>

597
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,271
<i>My playmate saw an opportunity</i>

598
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,775
<i>to paint me into a corner
to see if I'd find my way out,</i>

599
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,194
<i>if I'd fight to survive.</i>

600
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,722
<i>If you have a
well-preserved sample,</i>

601
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:18,393
<i>transferring a dry drop of blood
is relatively easy,</i>

602
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,854
<i>almost as easy as it was lifting
Jorge Castillo's fingerprints</i>

603
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,607
<i>from his boat and
putting them on this knife.</i>

604
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,599
Just got off the phone
with the FBI.

605
00:41:58,683 --> 00:41:59,934
<i>Now for the hard part.</i>

606
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,186
I wanted to see what their
computers would spit out.

607
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,772
I cross-referenced my profile
with the ice-truck killer list.

608
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,399
11 new hits.

609
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,277
How about we hold off till
we get a sketch,

610
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,361
take it from there.

611
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,073
I know, I know. I want to get
a head start on this.

612
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,993
We could look these over
at lunch -- My treat.

613
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,078
You never give up,
do you?

614
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,916
Thank your mom for dinner
the other night.

615
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,251
Can't remember
the last time

616
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,795
I met a guy's family
and they actually liked me.

617
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,172
You held your own.

618
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,798
Most people don't get
a dirty word in edgewise

619
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,383
with my sisters around the table.

620
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,470
In our house, every Thursday
night was pancake night --

621
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:37,180
A Morgan tradition.

622
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,390
I miss that kind
of stuff, you know?

623
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,184
I found something.

624
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,729
The wife's blood?
You're sure?

625
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,065
This was found in the Castillo's
bedroom hamper.

626
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,525
We check all the clothing items
that come in.

627
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,444
Sometimes because of sheer
volume, that takes time.

628
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,820
It doesn't prove anything.

629
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,447
Not by itself but

630
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,283
I've been re-examining the video
footage I took from that morning.

631
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,036
Notice the cuts along
the carotid arteries.

632
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,579
They're long, deep.

633
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,289
Valerie Castillo bled to death
in minutes.

634
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,332
No shit.

635
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,750
The person who did this

636
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,045
wasn't trying to emulate
the ice-truck killer. He was...

637
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,087
in a hurry.

638
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,798
He was probably afraid
of getting caught.

639
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:12,673
Most killers are.

640
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,177
Except if this was a copycat,
he wouldn't be in a rush.

641
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,429
He would savor his first kill.

642
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,724
He would control the precise moment
Valerie Castillo died instead of

643
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,893
just letting
her bleed out.

644
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,353
This is all too...

645
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,940
passive.

646
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:33,152
Have you completely ruled out
the husband?

647
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,404
Why are you doing this?

648
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:38,282
The boy said he didn't recognize
Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

649
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,618
Well, he was a dehydrated and
traumatized 7-year-old

650
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,787
left to fend for himself
for days in a salvage yard.

651
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,831
You really think it's the husband?

652
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:47,083
He's a deep-sea fisherman.
Most know how to use a knife.

653
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,377
Plus, he's still missing.

654
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,883
Have you finished your search
of the salvage yard?

655
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,845
I'll have them send
the cadets out again.

656
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,598
Hey, I'm sorry.

657
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,270
I know how hard you worked
on that profile.

658
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,313
No, Dex, I really
don't think you do.

659
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,536
How long are you grounded for?

660
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,247
Two months.

661
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,960
Deb, I had to tell him.

662
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,462
No, Dex, you didn't.

663
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,257
You could have kept
your fucking mouth shut.

664
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,384
Dad was worried about you,
and so was I.

665
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,928
Well, now you can spend
more time together.

666
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,598
I'm not stupid, Dexter.
That's always what you wanted.

667
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,141
No, it's not.

668
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,561
Deb, you're my sister.

669
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:53,107
No, I am not.
And he is my father!

670
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,735
There are so many times,
I swear, Dexter,

671
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,279
I wish he wouldn't
have brought you home!

672
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:05,077
Dexter, I am...
so sorry.

673
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:08,331
I really... really didn't
mean it like that.

674
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:14,712
Here.

675
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,467
I thought you might want that.

676
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,637
You're a better shot
than me anyway.

677
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:01,175
- Hello?
- Paul, hey, it's me.

678
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,595
- Look, we need to talk.
- Sure thing.

679
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:08,015
I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean,

680
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,602
the kids are doing so well now.

681
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:15,356
Maybe -- Maybe it would be
a good idea if you...

682
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:17,149
...don't come to the party.

683
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:19,819
- I just want...
- She is my daughter, too, Rita.

684
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,612
I have every
right to be there.

685
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,197
You know what?
I'm sorry.

686
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:25,825
I'm sorry, but I have
full custody now,

687
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,452
and you can't just drop in
on us like this anymore.

688
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,497
Now, I checked and the restraining
order is still in effect.

689
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:33,082
So if you step one foot
on this property,

690
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,834
the first call I'm gonna
make is to the police.

691
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,378
The second call is
to your parole officer.

692
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,486
I need the sergeant.

693
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,290
Morgan.

694
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,378
I'll be right there.

695
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,047
Est? listo.

696
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,384
Ya lo tir?.

697
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,802
Oscarsito.

698
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:30,389
It?o Roberto!

699
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,351
The uncle called our office
this morning. He lives in Tampa.

700
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:40,149
That's great.
He should be with family.

701
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,401
Can I take him home?

702
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,112
We're good.

703
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:48,074
Thank you.

704
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,576
Thank you for
finding him, huh?

705
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:52,286
He's a very special boy.

706
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:54,872
I know.

707
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:02,046
Cu?date?

708
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,898
L.T., you need to see this.

709
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,744
- You okay?
- These contacts.

710
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,875
Dios m?o.

711
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,424
Wrecks like this are usually
sold for scrap.

712
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,385
The husband stashes
a knife inside

713
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,303
and lets a demo crew
shred the truck

714
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,972
before we find it.

715
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,682
No more murder weapon.

716
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,142
There's blood.

717
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,018
Want to bet it's the wife's?

718
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:00,729
It's always the husband.
You were right all along.

719
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,565
Shake it off, Morgan.
Homicide takes time.

720
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,151
<i>Deb will forgive me...
eventually.</i>

721
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,736
<i>That's who she is --
Bighearted, kind.</i>

722
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,738
<i>Nothing like me.</i>

723
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,116
- Laguerta thought you should see this.
- What you got?

724
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,995
That kid Oscar swears
this is who he saw.

725
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:24,128
- Son of a bitch.
- Dex.

726
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,882
<i>Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock,
a knife with his prints,</i>

727
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,884
<i>and a drop of his wife's blood.</i>

728
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,635
<i>Forensics trifecta like that</i>

729
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,679
<i>should trump a child's drawing...</i>

730
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:35,264
<i>I hope.</i>

731
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:48,194
- Too fucking weird.
- Jesus Christ saved this kid?

732
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,529
On his own for
as long as Oscar was,

733
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,323
who's to say he didn't?

734
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,877
When did lighting candles become
more fun than blowing them out?

735
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,462
Nice turnout.

736
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,840
I called all the moms
to assure them

737
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:13,260
that Paul would not be
making an appearance.

738
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:17,223
Do Astor and Cody know that
you told their dad not to come?

739
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,103
After presents.

740
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:27,942
Ready?

741
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,655
Make a wish, baby.

742
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,657
Just don't tell anybody,
or it won't come true.

743
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:37,117
It already came true.
Dad's not here.

744
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:47,169
- I want the middle piece.
- Okay.

745
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:49,296
<i>I was wrong about birthdays.</i>

746
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:53,342
<i>Maybe the reason to celebrate
them is what they offer --</i>

747
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:56,345
<i>The hope of living
to see another one.</i>

748
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,683
<i>The thing about
Deb forgiving me --</i>

749
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:03,644
<i>I better give her
a few more days.</i>

750
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:11,527
<i>I barely escaped getting
caught this time.</i>

751
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,405
<i>I realize now my days
are numbered.</i>

752
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:18,200
<i>So I better make
the most of them.</i>

753
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:30,254
<i>All along, I thought
this was a game</i>

754
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:32,840
<i>my alter ego and
I were playing.</i>

755
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:36,093
<i>But relationships change,</i>

756
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:38,012
<i>evolve,</i>

757
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,347
<i>and this one's getting deep.</i>

758
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,774
<i>Like Harry said in my dream...</i>

759
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,320
<i>...the storm's on its way.</i>
