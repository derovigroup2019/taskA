1
00:01:46,518 --> 00:01:48,582
Previously on "Dexter"...

2
00:01:48,747 --> 00:01:50,250
So if you or
that skinny bitch

3
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,780
try to screw
with what's mine,

4
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,950
I swear to God,
I don't care who I have to hurt.

5
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,267
<i>Let's face it, Paul.</i>

6
00:01:56,268 --> 00:01:57,653
<i>You've been a problem.</i>

7
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,430
<i>It's time for you to go away.</i>

8
00:01:59,706 --> 00:02:01,681
It's Paul.
He...

9
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:03,650
He violated Florida's
three-strikes law.

10
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:06,477
The cops picked him up
totally strung out on heroin.

11
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:08,495
He's back in jail.

12
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:13,646
Holy shit!
They're fucking fingertips.

13
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:16,691
He started getting all rough
with me until he saw this.

14
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:17,552
Then what?

15
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:20,151
Then he changed his tune,
got all turned on.

16
00:02:20,296 --> 00:02:22,121
Told me to take
my fake hand off.

17
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,661
He takes all my nail polish

18
00:02:23,805 --> 00:02:25,910
and paints each nail
a different color.

19
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,830
- Menthol?
- Like cough drops.

20
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:31,540
I could hear them clicking
against his teeth when he...

21
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,022
Son of a bitch loved
those fucking lozenges.

22
00:02:34,218 --> 00:02:36,271
I was confused
because I love you.

23
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,280
What did you say?

24
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,203
I love you.

25
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:41,942
I love you, too.

26
00:02:46,528 --> 00:02:48,001
What happened to your lip?

27
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:55,902
No, it's -- I had an incident
with a tool at the workshop.

28
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:06,872
I need an ambulance at
1228 Calendar Street.

29
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:08,400
A guy's been stabbed.

30
00:03:23,606 --> 00:03:26,321
<i>I've never had much use
for the concept of hell,</i>

31
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:28,671
<i>but if hell exists, I'm in it.</i>

32
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:39,340
<i>The same images running
through my head over and over.</i>

33
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,781
<i>I was there.</i>

34
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,310
<i>I saw my mother's death.</i>

35
00:03:58,046 --> 00:04:00,760
<i>A buried memory,
forgotten all these years.</i>

36
00:04:00,838 --> 00:04:02,882
<i>It climbed inside me that day.</i>

37
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:06,400
<i>And it's been with
me ever since --</i>

38
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:08,802
<i>My dark passenger.</i>

39
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:21,931
You should be focusing
on me, socio.

40
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,320
Seriously want to get the motherfucker
that did this to Batista.

41
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:34,961
You all right?

42
00:04:35,227 --> 00:04:37,003
Yeah.
I'm okay.

43
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:39,803
I'm just, you know,
distraught about Angel.

44
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:42,203
How's he doing?
Do we know?

45
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:43,873
Still in surgery.

46
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:44,982
Laguerta's there.

47
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:49,012
God, I hate feeling
so helpless.

48
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:52,772
What, no jokes about
providing gross sexual comfort

49
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:54,602
in a time of crisis?

50
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:56,593
Our friend was stabbed...

51
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:58,280
And he might die.

52
00:04:58,717 --> 00:05:00,213
Officer Morgan.

53
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,291
What do you think, Dex?

54
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:09,302
He put up a fight.
There was a struggle.

55
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:10,500
Attaboy, Angel.

56
00:05:11,288 --> 00:05:12,881
Here, this trail --

57
00:05:12,886 --> 00:05:14,482
Steady stream of drops.

58
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:18,003
He had a few seconds.
Tried to move away until --

59
00:05:18,926 --> 00:05:20,093
till he fell.

60
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,323
<i>So much blood.</i>

61
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,651
<i>What's happening to me?</i>

62
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:01,460
No way.

63
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:03,740
You're the one I'm
supposed to meet.

64
00:06:04,027 --> 00:06:05,500
In the flesh.

65
00:06:05,546 --> 00:06:08,183
You know, I was just talking
to someone about you.

66
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:18,891
That tickles.

67
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:20,890
Don't stop.

68
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:24,060
I wouldn't dream of stopping.

69
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:27,652
You're so different
this time --

70
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:29,262
Gentle.

71
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:33,803
Are you gonna try and get all
pervy with my stump again?

72
00:06:33,856 --> 00:06:35,253
Actually, your...

73
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:38,061
...imperfection is what
saved you the first time.

74
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,203
Saved me from what?

75
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:43,423
True artistry.

76
00:06:45,258 --> 00:06:47,250
The message of my work is --

77
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,540
not in the product itself,
but

78
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,360
rather the presentation.

79
00:06:53,508 --> 00:06:55,302
That wrinkled flesh

80
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:57,501
on your radial carpal joint
is far from perfect.

81
00:06:57,526 --> 00:06:59,150
It's quite unsightly, actually.

82
00:06:59,316 --> 00:07:01,502
Hey, you don't have to
be an asshole about it.

83
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:03,292
Hey, hey, no, no, no.
Shh, shh, shh.

84
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:06,102
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:08,273
I didn't mean to offend.

86
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:12,842
Truthfully...

87
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:15,102
I'm thankful for you.

88
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:18,102
You're my escape plan.

89
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:20,761
Escape from what?

90
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:22,912
The police.

91
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:26,162
Because of you,
I've had to speed up my...

92
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:27,473
project.

93
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:29,953
I need something to
distract them by.

94
00:07:30,006 --> 00:07:30,972
And I always found

95
00:07:31,005 --> 00:07:33,401
a freshly chopped-up body
always does the trick.

96
00:07:33,898 --> 00:07:35,760
Wait, wait!
No!

97
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:37,300
Don't struggle.

98
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:38,860
That never helps.

99
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:40,970
I'm compressing your
carotid artery,

100
00:07:41,457 --> 00:07:44,350
and that is cutting off
oxygen to your brain.

101
00:07:44,537 --> 00:07:46,210
In about 10 seconds,

102
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:48,293
you'll be unconscious.

103
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:16,793
<i>Hey, it's Rudy.
Leave a message.</i>

104
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:18,890
Okay, I guess you went to bed.

105
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,401
Or you fell asleep on the
couch watching "Xena" reruns,

106
00:08:22,456 --> 00:08:24,603
which I still think
makes you a dork.

107
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,903
Either way, call me
when you get this, okay?

108
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:31,501
Miss you.

109
00:08:33,368 --> 00:08:35,472
He's still in surgery, but

110
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:37,303
I don't know when
we'll hear anything.

111
00:08:37,337 --> 00:08:39,632
So I guess you won't be
coming over tonight.

112
00:08:40,147 --> 00:08:42,330
No.
I mean, I can't.

113
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,803
Alright.
I understand.

114
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:45,362
You need to be there
for your friend.

115
00:08:46,138 --> 00:08:47,822
I haven't told the kids yet.

116
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:49,510
Told them about Angel?

117
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:51,773
No, about Paul...

118
00:08:51,808 --> 00:08:53,261
Being back in prison?

119
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:56,651
I hate breaking their hearts.
They think so much of their dad now.

120
00:08:56,688 --> 00:08:57,403
Right.

121
00:09:02,365 --> 00:09:03,853
You know what?

122
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:06,483
Focus on Angel.
We can talk about this later.

123
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:07,463
Thanks.

124
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,101
They're actually coming
out right now. I got to go.

125
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:25,771
Angel sustained severe
internal injuries.

126
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:28,253
He lost a lot of blood.

127
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:30,511
But...

128
00:09:30,618 --> 00:09:32,182
the surgery was successful.

129
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:35,450
It looks like our
boy's out of the woods.

130
00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:42,012
<i>I know I should stay,</i>

131
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:44,472
<i>be a part of the group hug.</i>

132
00:09:45,428 --> 00:09:47,530
<i>But I can't focus.</i>

133
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:50,150
<i>I'm trapped in the
clutches of a memory.</i>

134
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:52,832
<i>I need to know what it means.</i>

135
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:02,663
Morgan.

136
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:04,701
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

137
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,530
I have someplace I have to be.

138
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:11,900
Well, we all got
someplace to be.

139
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:13,243
But you just found out

140
00:10:13,285 --> 00:10:14,943
that somebody who was supposed
to be your friend is gonna live.

141
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:16,453
Does that make
you feel anything?

142
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:18,990
Anything at all?

143
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:23,647
Take your fucking hand off me.

144
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:30,505
Just what I always thought.

145
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,916
Right.

146
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,293
* Deck the halls with
parts of bodies *

147
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:43,540
* La-da-da-da dum *

148
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:05,330
Shit.
Just what I need.

149
00:11:20,935 --> 00:11:23,610
- Hey.
- I know it's late.

150
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:25,693
I guess you didn't
get my message.

151
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:28,670
I drove by and saw your car.

152
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:31,253
I can go.

153
00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:32,970
Get your ass in here.

154
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,983
It's about time you see
where I live anyway.

155
00:11:37,508 --> 00:11:39,703
You have no idea
how much I needed this.

156
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:41,500
You feel good.

157
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:44,220
And cold.
You're freezing!

158
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:47,411
Well, then stay
and keep me warm.

159
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:04,692
This Batista thing has
gotten to you, hasn't it?

160
00:12:07,148 --> 00:12:09,770
Angel's daughter was there.

161
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:12,800
That's got to be rough.

162
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:15,392
Daughter of a cop --

163
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,242
Just like you.

164
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:19,871
Yeah.

165
00:12:20,635 --> 00:12:22,151
I remember what that's like --

166
00:12:22,287 --> 00:12:23,973
Kissing your father goodbye,

167
00:12:24,768 --> 00:12:26,663
always afraid it's
for the last time.

168
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:31,320
Let's get out of town
for the weekend --

169
00:12:31,505 --> 00:12:33,400
Just the two of us.

170
00:12:34,058 --> 00:12:35,770
We need to talk.

171
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,683
I'm sitting right here.

172
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:43,790
Nope.

173
00:12:44,585 --> 00:12:46,973
The time has got to be right.

174
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:51,240
Okay.

175
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:54,720
It'll have to wait...

176
00:12:55,055 --> 00:12:57,990
At least till we catch the
asshole who did this to Batista.

177
00:12:58,717 --> 00:13:01,781
Let me warn you --
I can be very persistent.

178
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:03,773
I need to get out of town,

179
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:05,061
and I need you...

180
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,672
to come...

181
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:07,953
with me.

182
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,222
What I need is sleep,

183
00:13:13,405 --> 00:13:14,902
which is not gonna be easy.

184
00:13:14,937 --> 00:13:17,150
I'm totally wired
from all this shit.

185
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:19,603
Well, lucky for you,

186
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:21,341
I have the perfect cure.

187
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:23,710
My loving arms.

188
00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:26,563
And...

189
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,463
I got a little thing
to help you sleep.

190
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:32,473
That ain't no little thing.

191
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:34,832
I meant Valium.

192
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,003
It's one of the perks
working at the hospital.

193
00:13:37,246 --> 00:13:39,582
Wine and Valium?

194
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:42,383
I'll be totally helpless.

195
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:44,142
You read my mind.

196
00:14:11,478 --> 00:14:13,941
Well, as I live and breathe!

197
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,180
You miss me?

198
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:18,242
You and the bear claws you're
hiding behind your back.

199
00:14:20,508 --> 00:14:22,470
This must be important.

200
00:14:22,657 --> 00:14:24,253
Haven't seen much
of you lately.

201
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:25,931
No rest for the wicked.

202
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:28,530
How's Gene?

203
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:30,723
Good days and bad.

204
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:33,392
He just finished his
first round of radiation.

205
00:14:33,677 --> 00:14:35,501
Well, he's a good guy.

206
00:14:36,065 --> 00:14:38,450
Not much of a bridge
player, though.

207
00:14:38,598 --> 00:14:40,130
Harry and Gene used to get

208
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:43,940
so mad every time Doris and I
would take them to the cleaners.

209
00:14:46,997 --> 00:14:49,691
I was hoping you could dig
up an old case file for me.

210
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:50,901
Well, sure thing.

211
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:52,080
Got a date?

212
00:14:52,347 --> 00:14:53,961
Not exactly.

213
00:14:54,196 --> 00:14:56,730
It's the crime scene
where Harry found me.

214
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:03,252
I wish I could help, but...

215
00:15:03,727 --> 00:15:05,883
everything from that
long ago is boxed up

216
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:08,040
in the basement at City Hall.

217
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:10,343
And... as you can see,

218
00:15:10,598 --> 00:15:13,983
I'm up to my you-know-what
in year-end reports, so...

219
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:20,561
It's my lieutenant.

220
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:26,183
Camilla, is there
anything you remember?

221
00:15:26,788 --> 00:15:30,310
What I remember, Dexter Morgan,
is your father caring enough

222
00:15:30,616 --> 00:15:34,373
to bring you into his home
and give you a loving family.

223
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:38,531
I wouldn't keep your
lieutenant waiting.

224
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:43,252
Who found the body parts?

225
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:44,632
I did.

226
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:46,062
They were left under the tree.

227
00:15:46,097 --> 00:15:49,181
I thought it was the crew from
last night just messing around...

228
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,950
Till I found the head.

229
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:54,471
I told him not to touch anything,
but he never listens.

230
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,410
God, Patty,
you're such a bitch.

231
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,773
Did you guys see anything
out of the ordinary

232
00:15:57,807 --> 00:15:59,131
before you found the body?

233
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,171
There were some broken
ornaments by the tree.

234
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:06,712
Who could do something like
this so close to Christmas?

235
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:08,273
The Grinch.

236
00:16:09,298 --> 00:16:11,451
Oh, you're a fucking riot, Max!

237
00:16:11,686 --> 00:16:14,351
Like anyone's gonna go
shopping down here after this.

238
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:17,070
- There go our jobs.
- Thank you for your cooperation.

239
00:16:20,776 --> 00:16:22,632
Oh, sucks to be an elf.

240
00:16:27,847 --> 00:16:29,573
...Get some visual surveillance.

241
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,963
I got here as fast as I could.
What are we looking at?

242
00:16:32,098 --> 00:16:34,661
Female victim.
Cut up into pieces.

243
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:36,292
The ice-truck killer?
So soon?

244
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,550
Yep. And after the bloodbath
at the hotel,

245
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,162
can't wait to see
how the captain's gonna

246
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,400
handle the press
on this one.

247
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:42,341
- James!
- Yeah?

248
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:44,193
I need you to walk
Dexter to the crime scene.

249
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:46,681
And will somebody turn off
this goddamn snow machine?!

250
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,372
Your sister can help you out.

251
00:16:49,628 --> 00:16:52,760
That a whole sexual-tension
thing or am I missing something?

252
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,553
103.

253
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:59,530
It's the same numbers he
left at Marina View hotel.

254
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:01,260
Any leads as to what they mean?

255
00:17:01,306 --> 00:17:02,531
We've talked to numerologists,

256
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:03,400
mathematicians,

257
00:17:03,437 --> 00:17:04,601
code breakers
-- Nothing.

258
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,990
They need more to go on.

259
00:17:09,335 --> 00:17:13,402
<i>First he turns my whole world inside
out with a carnival of blood.</i>

260
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:18,763
<i>Now he leaves me this --</i>

261
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:22,292
<i>A calming oasis in the
desert of my confusion.</i>

262
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:23,942
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

263
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:33,552
Crime scene's wiped clean.

264
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:34,903
Another hooker?

265
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,792
Ho, ho, ho --
Another dead ho.

266
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,372
Somebody's been naughty.

267
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:39,310
Hey, Morgan.

268
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:40,803
Want to sit on my lap
when we're done

269
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:42,623
and tell me what you
want for Christmas?

270
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:44,300
And he's back!

271
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:45,103
No, thanks.

272
00:17:45,126 --> 00:17:46,141
Last thing on my wish list

273
00:17:46,188 --> 00:17:48,351
is a burning sensation
when I pee.

274
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,620
This doesn't seem right.

275
00:17:52,198 --> 00:17:55,063
Body parts scattered
among the presents.

276
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,502
Broken ornaments.

277
00:17:56,605 --> 00:17:58,903
It's not his usual
meticulous style.

278
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:01,903
It seems rushed...

279
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:04,200
Haphazard.

280
00:18:04,306 --> 00:18:06,803
That would explain why we
can't find one of the hands.

281
00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:13,971
What's wrong?

282
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:16,751
There's something
underneath the torso.

283
00:18:22,928 --> 00:18:24,821
Merry Christmas, Miami.

284
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,513
After all this time,

285
00:18:26,548 --> 00:18:28,810
why do you think the ice-truck
killer has struck again?

286
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:31,673
Any answer at this time would
be pure speculation on my part.

287
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:34,170
Do you think it has any
connection with your department's

288
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:36,311
handling of the
Neil Perry fiasco?

289
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:37,622
Sir?

290
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:48,961
"You've arrested
the wrong man.

291
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:51,733
"Made the world think
I'm a rank amateur,

292
00:18:51,856 --> 00:18:54,150
"and I'm very,
very angry

293
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,372
"to answer for your mistakes."

294
00:18:58,538 --> 00:18:59,800
Stop the tape.

295
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:01,340
What are you doing?

296
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,303
Look at her tears.
They're rolling up.

297
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:05,733
Oh, my God.

298
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,631
Bastard's got her upside down.

299
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:12,322
That's how he bleeds them out.
He strings them up like meat.

300
00:19:20,177 --> 00:19:25,162
Please.
No, please, no --

301
00:19:26,878 --> 00:19:28,462
All right, turn it off.

302
00:19:28,885 --> 00:19:31,740
I'll have the tape sent to
the station for analysis.

303
00:19:31,975 --> 00:19:33,403
Sergeant Doakes,
you're on point.

304
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,661
With all due respect, sir,

305
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,812
lieutenant Laguerta's in
charge of this investigation.

306
00:19:36,855 --> 00:19:37,710
Not anymore.

307
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:39,873
The fact is we haven't
been able to catch this guy,

308
00:19:39,905 --> 00:19:41,731
and now he's rubbing
our noses in it.

309
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:44,472
We've got to come up
with some fresh ideas.

310
00:19:46,328 --> 00:19:48,993
This is some bullshit.
I'll go talk to him.

311
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:51,141
No, no, no.
Do as he says.

312
00:19:51,617 --> 00:19:54,001
The commissioner has
his ass in a sling.

313
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:57,691
He's up for review.
Word is he's getting the boot.

314
00:19:57,855 --> 00:19:59,802
So you're just gonna
sit back and take this?

315
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:02,773
Well, if it means being seen
as his worthy successor...

316
00:20:03,507 --> 00:20:04,951
I'll be at the hospital.

317
00:20:04,985 --> 00:20:06,470
All right, P.B. and J. inside,

318
00:20:06,556 --> 00:20:08,813
cut diagonally,
not straight across.

319
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:10,501
Tastes better that way.

320
00:20:10,675 --> 00:20:12,870
Has dad said
if he's coming over

321
00:20:12,956 --> 00:20:15,353
Christmas eve
or Christmas morning?

322
00:20:15,986 --> 00:20:17,151
I miss him.

323
00:20:17,705 --> 00:20:19,551
Well,
I'm afraid your dad's not

324
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:21,800
gonna make it this
year for the holidays.

325
00:20:22,548 --> 00:20:23,941
Where is he?

326
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,961
Well, uh...he's --

327
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:28,040
He's back in jail,
isn't he?

328
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:31,753
Look, I know he wanted
to say goodbye,

329
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:33,401
but there wasn't any time.

330
00:20:33,457 --> 00:20:35,142
He loves you guys so much.

331
00:20:36,938 --> 00:20:38,943
I forgot my math book.

332
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:43,360
I'm -- I'm sure he'd love
to hear from you.

333
00:20:43,397 --> 00:20:44,701
We could write him a letter.

334
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:46,353
It's all your fault.

335
00:20:48,946 --> 00:20:51,290
You could at least pretend
you want to be here.

336
00:20:52,675 --> 00:20:55,123
You're the one who had
the urgent need for tacos.

337
00:20:55,257 --> 00:20:56,982
Yeah, so we could 
talk about Rudy.

338
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,133
He's been acting weird lately.

339
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:01,952
Last night he said
we need to talk.

340
00:21:02,878 --> 00:21:04,373
Well, that's never good.

341
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,562
Well, thanks.
I feel a lot better.

342
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:08,993
I've only been obsessing
about this all day.

343
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,652
Think you could
talk to him for me?

344
00:21:15,337 --> 00:21:16,802
Look, it's Rudy.

345
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:18,392
I sort of called him.

346
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,012
Dex, Deb didn't tell me
you'd be joining us.

347
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,193
Apparently she's had
a lot on her mind.

348
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:24,513
Oh, shit.

349
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:27,130
That's work.
I have to go.

350
00:21:28,105 --> 00:21:31,103
Here, take mine.
Sorry.

351
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,661
What's with your lip?

352
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:40,340
Deb catch you with
a right hook?

353
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,693
She can be pretty
protective with the remote.

354
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,321
I had a little... workshop
accident this morning.

355
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:47,770
Doesn't look like it
happened this morning.

356
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,303
The cut's already closing up.

357
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,363
Did I say--
I meant yesterday morning.

358
00:21:51,405 --> 00:21:52,821
I think I'm working too hard.

359
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:55,361
Anyway, I don't think
my lip is why

360
00:21:55,405 --> 00:21:57,101
Deb arranged
this little chitchat.

361
00:21:58,846 --> 00:22:01,851
My sister is afraid there
may be trouble in paradise.

362
00:22:02,226 --> 00:22:03,620
Your sister's wrong.

363
00:22:04,598 --> 00:22:06,562
So this whole "need
to talk" thing?

364
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:10,031
I'm starting to look
at the big picture.

365
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:12,510
She's someone that

366
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:15,192
I could see spending the rest
of my life with, you know?

367
00:22:15,228 --> 00:22:17,173
No, I don't know.

368
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:20,492
But I do know that Deb's
falling for you...

369
00:22:20,695 --> 00:22:21,852
Hard.

370
00:22:22,068 --> 00:22:23,130
You hurt her...

371
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:25,852
- And you'll hurt me.
- Something like that.

372
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:32,933
Angel, se recupera.

373
00:22:33,245 --> 00:22:35,491
Angel va a estar en la
casa para la Navidad.

374
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:39,801
Okay?
El es un hombre fuerte y strong.

375
00:22:39,906 --> 00:22:41,360
Y adem?s...

376
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm tired of hearing
you two gallinas cluck.

377
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:46,781
Hey, you.

378
00:22:48,905 --> 00:22:50,772
You had us so worried.

379
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:52,070
If I'd have known that

380
00:22:52,106 --> 00:22:54,400
this would get you back
in the same room with me,

381
00:22:54,437 --> 00:22:56,902
I would have gotten
stabbed sooner.

382
00:22:57,808 --> 00:22:59,903
I'm gonna get the doctor.

383
00:23:05,805 --> 00:23:07,220
No, no, no.
What are you doing?

384
00:23:07,268 --> 00:23:08,700
No, dejalo.

385
00:23:10,106 --> 00:23:11,702
The doctor said you're lucky
to be alive

386
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:12,852
and still have a liver.

387
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:15,223
That's why I got two, right?

388
00:23:16,808 --> 00:23:19,710
It's a good thing you
decided to be a cop.

389
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:24,701
Tell me that you
caught the cocksucker

390
00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:26,830
that ruined one of
my best shirts.

391
00:23:27,158 --> 00:23:28,703
We don't have any leads.

392
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:30,783
Did you see anything?

393
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:31,700
No.

394
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,251
He was behind me.

395
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,330
I just felt the blade go in.

396
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,641
It happened so fast.

397
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,001
Maria...

398
00:23:48,186 --> 00:23:50,211
How long has
Nina been here?

399
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:52,423
She was the first
one at the hospital.

400
00:23:52,655 --> 00:23:54,433
She's been with
you the whole time.

401
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:57,122
Yo no s? porque, pero...

402
00:24:08,508 --> 00:24:11,371
<i>My mother was murdered
before my eyes.</i>

403
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,420
<i>Makes sense I'd choose a life</i>

404
00:24:14,456 --> 00:24:16,703
<i>where I search
for meaning in blood.</i>

405
00:24:17,495 --> 00:24:20,702
<i>The sole memory I have of
her is being covered in it.</i>

406
00:24:21,806 --> 00:24:24,250
<i>I need to know more details.</i>

407
00:24:28,206 --> 00:24:29,910
I hope that look means
you found something

408
00:24:29,957 --> 00:24:31,370
on Batista's shirt.

409
00:24:31,406 --> 00:24:32,680
You should see this.

410
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:38,852
That's what I drove all the
way back from the hospital for?

411
00:24:38,888 --> 00:24:41,050
This drop of blood doesn't
match the wound pattern

412
00:24:41,107 --> 00:24:43,100
or the spatter from the
rest of Batista's shirt,

413
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:45,343
and look where it is --
On the inside of the back collar.

414
00:24:45,905 --> 00:24:47,501
Angel is stabbed from behind.

415
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:48,850
You think
it's the attacker's blood?

416
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:50,280
We know Batista fought back.

417
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:51,651
Well, run the DNA.

418
00:24:51,706 --> 00:24:53,153
If this guy's got priors,

419
00:24:53,185 --> 00:24:54,670
we'll get a hit
on the database.

420
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:56,151
Already sent a
sample to the lab.

421
00:24:56,186 --> 00:24:57,932
All right, let's get this together.
Come on, let's go.

422
00:25:02,938 --> 00:25:04,622
Sorry to hear...
You know,

423
00:25:04,897 --> 00:25:06,863
about Matthews taking
you off the case.

424
00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:09,490
Last gasp of a desperate man.

425
00:25:10,348 --> 00:25:12,713
Things are gonna
change around here.

426
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:15,512
And I won't forget your help.

427
00:25:21,397 --> 00:25:24,402
"And I'm very, very angry."

428
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:27,582
"Oh, God, no!
No, please!"

429
00:25:27,605 --> 00:25:28,771
I can't watch this again.

430
00:25:28,806 --> 00:25:31,103
I know it's tough, but just keep
your eyes on the monitor.

431
00:25:32,707 --> 00:25:34,102
Wait --
What was that?

432
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:35,463
The camera tilts up

433
00:25:35,906 --> 00:25:38,091
right before he hits
the off switch.

434
00:25:38,197 --> 00:25:39,400
Watch.

435
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:43,462
That, my friends,
is a monster refrigeration unit.

436
00:25:43,646 --> 00:25:46,190
He needs it cold to preserve
the bodies. We knew that.

437
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:47,171
But check this out.

438
00:25:47,305 --> 00:25:50,100
Look how much space there is
between her feet and the ceiling.

439
00:25:50,206 --> 00:25:51,353
This room is way bigger

440
00:25:51,387 --> 00:25:52,700
than your standard
commercial freezer.

441
00:25:52,738 --> 00:25:54,320
Most likely it was
a custom build.

442
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:55,473
So we should focus our search

443
00:25:55,507 --> 00:25:56,711
on commercial districts.

444
00:25:56,745 --> 00:25:57,442
No.

445
00:25:57,666 --> 00:25:58,801
Residential.

446
00:25:58,836 --> 00:26:00,753
You think he built
this in his own place?

447
00:26:00,788 --> 00:26:02,102
He picks up hookers, right?

448
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:03,150
I worked Vice.

449
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,901
The smart girls know
not to go near a factory

450
00:26:04,936 --> 00:26:07,251
or a warehouse unless you
never want to be seen again.

451
00:26:07,306 --> 00:26:08,100
How do we know

452
00:26:08,156 --> 00:26:09,533
he didn't knock out his victims

453
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,300
or drug them,

454
00:26:10,347 --> 00:26:11,741
then take them back
to a warehouse?

455
00:26:11,776 --> 00:26:13,972
None of the other victims
showed any signs of head injury

456
00:26:14,016 --> 00:26:15,103
or narcotics.

457
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:16,853
Besides, what better
way to trap a victim

458
00:26:16,885 --> 00:26:18,851
than to get her to walk
into your own home?

459
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:21,522
The escort service said
she was meeting her client

460
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:23,622
at the corner of Brickell
Avenue and Coral Way.

461
00:26:23,658 --> 00:26:25,592
And her body was found
at Santa's cottage,

462
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,003
which is on Biscayne mall.

463
00:26:27,046 --> 00:26:28,303
We'll map out grids.

464
00:26:28,347 --> 00:26:29,702
We'll focus on
private residences

465
00:26:29,787 --> 00:26:32,182
drawing large amounts of
power near those areas.

466
00:26:32,408 --> 00:26:34,150
We catch a break...

467
00:26:35,036 --> 00:26:36,900
We'll catch this
son of a bitch.

468
00:26:38,707 --> 00:26:40,203
Wait! Where the hell
are you going?

469
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:42,072
I need to do some
research on a case.

470
00:26:42,107 --> 00:26:43,731
You were supposed to call me
after your lunch with Rudy.

471
00:26:43,756 --> 00:26:45,152
I've been freaking out!

472
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:46,800
He sent me this text message.

473
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,553
"Cum sail away with me?"

474
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:50,181
He misspelled "come."

475
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:51,201
Dexter.

476
00:26:51,306 --> 00:26:52,301
This is no time to joke.

477
00:26:52,406 --> 00:26:54,702
This is good, right?
A romantic weekend?

478
00:26:54,755 --> 00:26:56,301
What did he say to you?

479
00:26:56,357 --> 00:26:57,721
Oh, wait, no.
Don't.

480
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:58,633
Don't tell me.

481
00:26:58,635 --> 00:27:00,542
Maybe he wants
it to be a surprise.

482
00:27:00,637 --> 00:27:02,843
Unless I should know.
Should I know?

483
00:27:02,906 --> 00:27:03,851
Okay.

484
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,160
Tell me.

485
00:27:05,205 --> 00:27:06,852
You know, no.
Don't.

486
00:27:06,907 --> 00:27:08,152
"We need to talk"?

487
00:27:08,187 --> 00:27:09,672
Who says that unless
you're getting dumped?

488
00:27:09,706 --> 00:27:11,202
I don't think that's
what this is about.

489
00:27:11,237 --> 00:27:13,852
He probably wants me out on the
water in case I make a scene.

490
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:15,301
You know, I always do this.

491
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:17,521
I put myself out there.
I set myself up to get hurt.

492
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:19,221
He wants to be part
of the family.

493
00:27:19,256 --> 00:27:20,581
What?

494
00:27:21,976 --> 00:27:22,910
Wait.

495
00:27:23,265 --> 00:27:24,443
Like...

496
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:25,802
Propose?

497
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:27,803
I have to get to the
library before it closes,

498
00:27:27,837 --> 00:27:29,852
but we'll talk about
this later, okay?

499
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:31,452
Oh, my God.

500
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:34,981
Oh, my God!

501
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:47,272
<i>I was never one to
dwell on my past,</i>

502
00:27:47,508 --> 00:27:49,431
<i>always content to
leave it a mystery.</i>

503
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:50,751
<i>No details --</i>

504
00:27:50,827 --> 00:27:53,193
<i>Just a blur of images
rushing by.</i>

505
00:27:53,468 --> 00:27:57,053
<i>But my friend out there wants to
bring those memories into focus.</i>

506
00:28:02,437 --> 00:28:03,790
<i>So do I.</i>

507
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:08,581
This is it for the Metro
News for 1972 through 1973.

508
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,403
The Tribune's archives...

509
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:27,470
<i>10/3?</i>

510
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:33,512
<i>1-0-3 --
Same as the hotel,</i>

511
00:28:33,706 --> 00:28:35,800
<i>same as Santa's cottage.</i>

512
00:28:36,057 --> 00:28:38,491
<i>This is what he wanted
me to find all along.</i>

513
00:28:44,637 --> 00:28:46,552
Close your eyes.

514
00:28:48,566 --> 00:28:50,302
Don't look.

515
00:28:51,645 --> 00:28:53,510
Laura Moser...

516
00:28:54,346 --> 00:28:55,601
My mother.

517
00:28:57,027 --> 00:29:00,001
<i>No wonder I felt so
disconnected my entire life.</i>

518
00:29:00,596 --> 00:29:02,903
<i>If I did have emotions,
I'd have to feel...</i>

519
00:29:03,696 --> 00:29:05,103
<i>this.</i>

520
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:14,613
October 3, 1973.

521
00:29:15,097 --> 00:29:18,251
Laura Moser and three others
found chopped up with a chain saw.

522
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:20,222
Apparently a drug dealer
didn't appreciate

523
00:29:20,257 --> 00:29:22,223
Laura and her friends
stealing his cocaine.

524
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:24,763
First officer on scene
was Harry Morgan.

525
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:25,963
You've been busy.

526
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:26,923
A crime that big

527
00:29:26,955 --> 00:29:29,093
and yet there's no record
of the case file at City Hall,

528
00:29:29,115 --> 00:29:31,202
that seems a bit odd.
Don't you think?

529
00:29:31,256 --> 00:29:32,473
It's a long time ago.

530
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:35,200
What is in that report that
Harry didn't want me to see?!

531
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:39,473
Why was there no mention
in any of the newspapers

532
00:29:39,505 --> 00:29:41,501
about a 3-year-old boy
at the crime scene?!

533
00:29:41,706 --> 00:29:42,703
Camilla...

534
00:29:44,355 --> 00:29:46,952
Damn it, I need to know.
I need that file.

535
00:29:47,256 --> 00:29:49,651
I can't give you the file
'cause it no longer exists.

536
00:29:50,257 --> 00:29:52,753
I destroyed it the day your
adoption went through.

537
00:29:53,488 --> 00:29:54,891
You did what?

538
00:29:55,217 --> 00:29:57,220
Made a promise to your father.

539
00:29:58,068 --> 00:30:00,073
Why, to protect him?

540
00:30:01,505 --> 00:30:03,103
To protect you.

541
00:30:11,358 --> 00:30:12,671
Harry had a code.

542
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:14,802
He'd never ask you
to destroy evidence.

543
00:30:15,037 --> 00:30:17,422
Your father was a decent
man and an honest cop,

544
00:30:17,756 --> 00:30:20,750
but what he saw in that
cargo container changed him.

545
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:22,900
You were left there for days,

546
00:30:23,108 --> 00:30:24,123
starving,

547
00:30:24,357 --> 00:30:26,903
in blood 2 inches thick.

548
00:30:35,728 --> 00:30:36,373
Yeah!

549
00:30:36,405 --> 00:30:38,453
Dex!
Cody's run away!

550
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:39,420
Are you sure?

551
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:41,122
Yeah,
I've looked everywhere.

552
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:43,200
Well, call the police.
I'll be right there.

553
00:30:43,235 --> 00:30:44,202
Okay.

554
00:30:47,377 --> 00:30:48,310
Camilla...

555
00:30:49,607 --> 00:30:51,430
I need to know the truth.

556
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,550
Kid...

557
00:30:54,997 --> 00:30:57,053
Leave this one alone.

558
00:30:58,488 --> 00:30:59,850
I can't sit here like this.

559
00:30:59,906 --> 00:31:01,501
I should be out there
doing something.

560
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:03,100
Rita, the police said
you need to stay here

561
00:31:03,157 --> 00:31:04,750
in case Cody comes home.

562
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:07,450
The neighbors are helping.
We'll find him.

563
00:31:07,486 --> 00:31:10,052
Yeah, but one squad
car for all of Miami?

564
00:31:10,086 --> 00:31:12,783
What if some crazy person
picked him up off the street?

565
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,230
It's all my fault.

566
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,582
Honey, what are
you talking about?

567
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:24,152
I should have heard
Cody get out of bed.

568
00:31:24,557 --> 00:31:26,282
I'm his big sister.

569
00:31:27,478 --> 00:31:29,210
Hey. Hey, look at me.

570
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:32,242
It's not your fault, okay?

571
00:31:33,307 --> 00:31:34,400
Okay?

572
00:31:36,106 --> 00:31:38,503
Could you go get
Dexter some water?

573
00:31:43,607 --> 00:31:44,460
God.

574
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:46,921
I should have seen
this coming.

575
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:48,800
Cody was so upset with me

576
00:31:48,838 --> 00:31:50,911
when I told him that
Paul was back in jail.

577
00:31:52,648 --> 00:31:53,573
Paul.

578
00:31:54,685 --> 00:31:56,753
Today's Thursday, right?

579
00:31:56,987 --> 00:31:57,602
Yeah.

580
00:31:57,837 --> 00:31:59,890
I think I know
where Cody might be.

581
00:32:10,747 --> 00:32:12,133
Hey.

582
00:32:13,106 --> 00:32:14,501
Need a push?

583
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:21,602
Today's the day you meet
daddy in the park, huh?

584
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:22,963
He'll be here.

585
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:24,651
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry,

586
00:32:24,688 --> 00:32:26,252
but he's not coming back --

587
00:32:26,495 --> 00:32:27,840
not for a long time.

588
00:32:30,605 --> 00:32:33,603
Look, we'll talk about this
when we get home, okay?

589
00:32:34,006 --> 00:32:37,050
<i>After all the lies Harry
left for me to uncover,</i>

590
00:32:37,108 --> 00:32:39,000
<i>I'd love to run away, too.</i>

591
00:32:40,718 --> 00:32:42,850
He won't even look at me.

592
00:32:43,206 --> 00:32:44,681
I'm not the one in jail,

593
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:46,601
and yet I'm still the bad guy.

594
00:32:46,995 --> 00:32:49,151
Well, you didn't tell
them the truth...

595
00:32:49,298 --> 00:32:50,981
About their father.

596
00:32:51,407 --> 00:32:53,543
I told them Paul
was back in jail.

597
00:32:54,177 --> 00:32:56,130
Well, right,
you told them where he is,

598
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:59,441
but you didn't tell them
who he is. He's still the same --

599
00:32:59,607 --> 00:33:02,502
drug-using, wife-beating
redneck he always was.

600
00:33:02,535 --> 00:33:04,181
They should hear that.

601
00:33:05,156 --> 00:33:07,863
You're not a parent.
You don't understand.

602
00:33:08,006 --> 00:33:09,652
You do anything to
protect your kids.

603
00:33:09,706 --> 00:33:11,302
Rita, wake up.
You're not protecting them.

604
00:33:11,335 --> 00:33:12,900
You're protecting Paul.

605
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:16,802
Well, I --
I got to get them home.

606
00:33:31,737 --> 00:33:33,510
Somebody's in a good mood.

607
00:33:33,706 --> 00:33:37,261
The commissioner and the review board
did not look happy this morning.

608
00:33:37,646 --> 00:33:39,991
They've been in Matthews'
office for two hours.

609
00:33:40,026 --> 00:33:42,423
You thinking his ass is about
three shades of red right now?

610
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:43,722
I don't care what color it is

611
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:46,003
as long as it's on
its way out the door.

612
00:33:56,805 --> 00:33:58,602
Tell me that did
not just happen.

613
00:33:58,766 --> 00:34:00,642
It's who you know
and who you blow.

614
00:34:00,907 --> 00:34:03,622
Probably picking their
fucking tee time.

615
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,300
Maria, watch your back.

616
00:34:05,446 --> 00:34:07,901
He's gonna be gunning for
you now more than ever.

617
00:34:08,676 --> 00:34:10,172
Let him try.

618
00:34:15,627 --> 00:34:17,732
My man Juan,
hook it up.

619
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:20,452
They didn't have
"Road and Track" so...

620
00:34:22,948 --> 00:34:25,003
That better be a
bag of applesauce.

621
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:27,802
Okay, Juan, at this point,
you should go save yourself. Go.

622
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:32,603
You got to be kidding me!

623
00:34:32,657 --> 00:34:34,053
Two double-meats?

624
00:34:34,187 --> 00:34:35,722
A man's got to eat.

625
00:34:38,105 --> 00:34:40,021
You're so cute when
you're annoyed.

626
00:34:40,107 --> 00:34:41,981
You know, your mouth makes
those little O's.

627
00:34:42,016 --> 00:34:42,813
God damn it, Angel,

628
00:34:42,837 --> 00:34:45,022
do I look like I'm being
fucking cute with you?

629
00:34:45,156 --> 00:34:48,863
- Well, not now you don't, no.
- Why do you always do this --

630
00:34:48,908 --> 00:34:50,571
make light of
things that matter?

631
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:54,300
Okay, I'm sorry.
Okay?

632
00:34:54,397 --> 00:34:57,301
When I come home,
I'll eat anything you want.

633
00:34:57,447 --> 00:34:59,980
No jokes, no complaining --
I promise.

634
00:35:00,578 --> 00:35:02,453
When you come home?

635
00:35:04,077 --> 00:35:06,652
I thought the way things
are going with us...

636
00:35:08,408 --> 00:35:10,660
I thought you'd forgiven me.

637
00:35:12,455 --> 00:35:14,573
Well, of course I forgive you.

638
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:18,453
I forgave you
a long time ago.

639
00:35:18,496 --> 00:35:21,092
Okay, so let's fix this.

640
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,061
This could be a
second chance for us.

641
00:35:25,505 --> 00:35:26,401
What?

642
00:35:30,635 --> 00:35:32,881
Look, you did what you did.

643
00:35:34,225 --> 00:35:35,861
It was hard.

644
00:35:37,575 --> 00:35:39,771
But it got us to
face the truth.

645
00:35:41,998 --> 00:35:44,102
We were miserable...

646
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,572
for years.

647
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:48,510
Do you really want
to survive this

648
00:35:48,556 --> 00:35:50,812
and go right back
to being unhappy?

649
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,073
Maybe.

650
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:54,602
What if I do?

651
00:35:58,437 --> 00:36:01,402
Look, you will always
be Jorge's father.

652
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,463
I will always care about you.

653
00:36:07,015 --> 00:36:09,233
I'll always be here for you.

654
00:36:12,427 --> 00:36:15,243
But our marriage is over.

655
00:36:27,865 --> 00:36:31,142
Why, yes, by all means,
Tom, please, come in.

656
00:36:31,305 --> 00:36:32,401
Maria...

657
00:36:32,917 --> 00:36:34,510
Let's you and me have a talk.

658
00:36:34,657 --> 00:36:36,940
Congratulations on the review.
I hear it went well.

659
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:38,353
You must be thrilled.

660
00:36:38,857 --> 00:36:40,353
But now, if you don't mind --

661
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,902
Let me get right to the point.

662
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:44,381
All our mishaps these
last few months --

663
00:36:44,565 --> 00:36:46,610
Failure to bring in
the ice-truck killer,

664
00:36:46,836 --> 00:36:48,953
mishandling of Tony Tucci...

665
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:50,763
Even Neil Perry --

666
00:36:50,795 --> 00:36:52,281
Neil Perry was your fuck-up...

667
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:54,302
Not mine.

668
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,911
They're all the result of
a bad command structure,

669
00:36:58,278 --> 00:36:59,933
and that's my failure.

670
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:02,842
Well...

671
00:37:03,506 --> 00:37:05,900
I'm glad to hear
you say that.

672
00:37:06,786 --> 00:37:09,772
Takes a big man to
admit his own mistakes.

673
00:37:11,488 --> 00:37:12,831
So this morning,

674
00:37:13,028 --> 00:37:16,673
the commissioner gave me the go-ahead
to restructure the division.

675
00:37:17,576 --> 00:37:21,122
Effective immediately, you will
no longer serve as my lieutenant.

676
00:37:23,166 --> 00:37:25,833
I'm sorry.
I know this must be difficult for you.

677
00:37:26,806 --> 00:37:29,243
Please, it's ridiculous.

678
00:37:32,018 --> 00:37:33,663
You really don't
want to do this.

679
00:37:33,987 --> 00:37:36,513
Because of your status
in the Cuban community?

680
00:37:36,936 --> 00:37:38,851
I'm a fucking hero
to this community!

681
00:37:38,887 --> 00:37:40,203
You think they're
just gonna accept it?

682
00:37:40,237 --> 00:37:41,950
Your replacement has
already been selected.

683
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:45,172
Her name is Esm? Pascal,
a transfer from fort Lauderdale --

684
00:37:45,205 --> 00:37:46,901
A real up-and-comer.

685
00:37:48,056 --> 00:37:50,772
Pascal, the Haitian-American?

686
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:54,002
The one who got shot last
year in the line of duty.

687
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:56,902
Turns out
she's an actual hero.

688
00:37:57,137 --> 00:37:59,900
You think I'm gonna stay quiet for this,
you're out of your mind.

689
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:01,920
I did warn you, Maria.

690
00:38:04,377 --> 00:38:07,001
I'm gonna need you to clear
out this office tonight.

691
00:38:07,288 --> 00:38:09,142
Expect a call from
my union rep.

692
00:38:09,225 --> 00:38:11,073
You want it, you'll always
have a place in the bullpen --

693
00:38:11,106 --> 00:38:12,552
And my fucking lawyer, too!

694
00:38:12,588 --> 00:38:13,921
...with all the other detectives.

695
00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:15,953
This isn't fucking over, Tom!

696
00:38:16,215 --> 00:38:20,102
You goddamn... son of a bitch!

697
00:38:27,285 --> 00:38:28,980
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

698
00:38:29,526 --> 00:38:30,590
How are you?

699
00:38:32,196 --> 00:38:34,022
How the hell do I look?

700
00:38:34,696 --> 00:38:37,040
I can barely remember
how I got here.

701
00:38:37,278 --> 00:38:39,100
Look, there's something
we need to discuss.

702
00:38:39,337 --> 00:38:41,980
If you came for an apology,
you wasted a tank of gas.

703
00:38:42,045 --> 00:38:43,353
Sit.
I'm not finished.

704
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,512
Fuck you.

705
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:47,680
Astor and Cody are
in the other room.

706
00:38:50,698 --> 00:38:53,182
Jesus, you brought them here?

707
00:38:53,685 --> 00:38:55,270
Look, I know this
will be difficult,

708
00:38:55,308 --> 00:38:58,292
but I need you to explain to
them why you're in this place.

709
00:38:58,515 --> 00:39:01,191
I have no fucking idea
why I'm in this place!

710
00:39:02,586 --> 00:39:03,420
Fine.

711
00:39:03,655 --> 00:39:05,863
Fine. You want to be in denial?
Go ahead.

712
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:08,433
You will never see
your kids again.

713
00:39:08,627 --> 00:39:11,343
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Rita, wait, wait.

714
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:16,191
I fought so hard to
win those kids back,

715
00:39:16,308 --> 00:39:17,673
especially Astor.

716
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:20,751
If they see me here like this,
I'm gonna lose them forever.

717
00:39:20,808 --> 00:39:21,553
Paul,

718
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:25,382
the one good thing that came out
of our marriage are those kids.

719
00:39:25,576 --> 00:39:27,591
And I know you love them.

720
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:31,533
But if you want to have any kind
of real relationship with them,

721
00:39:31,715 --> 00:39:34,252
it has to be with
the father they have,

722
00:39:34,718 --> 00:39:37,652
not the father they
wish they had.

723
00:39:37,837 --> 00:39:39,290
Now, you cheated on me.

724
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:41,901
You broke my heart,
you broke my bones,

725
00:39:41,925 --> 00:39:43,012
and I took it

726
00:39:43,105 --> 00:39:45,252
so those kids
wouldn't have to.

727
00:39:45,486 --> 00:39:48,771
But I am giving you the
chance to make it all right.

728
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:51,120
But not for me,

729
00:39:51,576 --> 00:39:52,811
for them.

730
00:39:53,355 --> 00:39:56,503
I...
wouldn't know what to say.

731
00:39:57,586 --> 00:40:01,103
Tell them you're paying
for your mistakes.

732
00:40:02,217 --> 00:40:04,233
It's a valuable lesson.

733
00:40:04,647 --> 00:40:06,933
It's one you never got.

734
00:40:10,098 --> 00:40:12,253
So what's it gonna be?

735
00:40:18,065 --> 00:40:19,090
Okay.

736
00:40:21,215 --> 00:40:23,563
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

737
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:24,731
Hey!

738
00:40:36,826 --> 00:40:39,123
All right,
this won't take long.

739
00:40:39,318 --> 00:40:41,080
There was a drop of blood

740
00:40:41,128 --> 00:40:43,022
on the back of your
shirt that wasn't yours,

741
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:45,202
so I need to check
the back of your head.

742
00:40:45,466 --> 00:40:48,890
Just so long as it's only my head
you're checking back there, bro.

743
00:40:50,995 --> 00:40:52,642
How are things
with you and Rita?

744
00:40:54,756 --> 00:40:56,723
Not so good, actually.
We kind of...

745
00:40:57,506 --> 00:40:59,851
had words.
I think I really upset her.

746
00:40:59,926 --> 00:41:01,543
That's rough, man.

747
00:41:02,405 --> 00:41:04,352
Maybe I'm not the
right person for her.

748
00:41:04,408 --> 00:41:06,172
Some people are meant
to be alone, right?

749
00:41:06,206 --> 00:41:07,503
Dex, socio,

750
00:41:07,606 --> 00:41:09,151
alone sucks.

751
00:41:09,585 --> 00:41:11,460
- Hijo de puta!
- Sorry.

752
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:14,850
Teeth marks.

753
00:41:15,636 --> 00:41:17,702
You definitely wounded this guy.

754
00:41:17,748 --> 00:41:18,502
Good.

755
00:41:18,748 --> 00:41:20,642
I hope I broke
his fucking nose...

756
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:23,080
Or at least gave him a fat lip.

757
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,413
Angel, have you ever met
Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?

758
00:41:29,558 --> 00:41:32,750
Yeah. I went by his office
a couple of days ago.

759
00:41:32,835 --> 00:41:34,222
Nice guy.

760
00:41:34,308 --> 00:41:35,293
Why?

761
00:41:40,407 --> 00:41:42,932
<i>At lunch, Rudy said he'd
hurt his lip that morning.</i>

762
00:41:42,977 --> 00:41:45,693
<i>He was lying, and I was
too distracted to care.</i>

763
00:41:46,075 --> 00:41:48,091
<i>But he's got my
full attention now.</i>

764
00:41:57,035 --> 00:41:58,390
Hey, you here tonight?

765
00:41:58,426 --> 00:42:00,372
Yeah, we're tits-deep in
the ice-truck killer.

766
00:42:00,408 --> 00:42:03,041
Might be onto something.
It's gonna be an all-nighter.

767
00:42:03,078 --> 00:42:05,702
So that text message you got from
Rudy about going away with him --

768
00:42:05,738 --> 00:42:07,413
you're not gonna do that?

769
00:42:07,615 --> 00:42:09,060
Tragically, no.

770
00:42:09,328 --> 00:42:12,112
I was all psyched to meet him
at the Miami Beach marina but

771
00:42:12,205 --> 00:42:14,951
this bullpen's my home
till we finish this.

772
00:42:14,978 --> 00:42:16,493
- Good.
- Good?

773
00:42:16,726 --> 00:42:18,672
I'm working on a theory that
Rudy was gonna propose,

774
00:42:18,717 --> 00:42:20,502
and now he can't --
Why is that good?

775
00:42:20,536 --> 00:42:22,603
No, I meant good that you're
making progress here.

776
00:42:22,705 --> 00:42:24,250
Yeah.
We're getting closer.

777
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:25,500
Fingers crossed.

778
00:42:25,558 --> 00:42:27,703
<i>At least I know my
sister is safe tonight,</i>

779
00:42:27,715 --> 00:42:31,103
<i>which gives me time to check
out my own theory on Rudy.</i>

780
00:42:32,688 --> 00:42:34,883
We've defined the area for
the residential search.

781
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:35,753
Good.

782
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:38,530
So we'll start canvassing
tonight. You take the --

783
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:44,092
That him?

784
00:42:45,008 --> 00:42:46,602
Yeah, how'd you know?

785
00:42:46,665 --> 00:42:49,113
'Cause you got that stupid-ass
grin on your face again.

786
00:42:50,396 --> 00:42:52,652
- Go ahead. Answer it.
- Okay.

787
00:42:55,098 --> 00:42:57,310
- Hey.
- Hey, Supercop.

788
00:42:57,517 --> 00:42:58,802
What's the word?

789
00:42:58,858 --> 00:43:00,401
I'm kind of in a
thing right now.

790
00:43:00,508 --> 00:43:02,000
Got it.
I'll be quick.

791
00:43:02,007 --> 00:43:03,852
You never answered
my text.

792
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:06,303
Do I have the pleasure of
your company this weekend?

793
00:43:06,568 --> 00:43:07,923
Yeah, about that --

794
00:43:07,927 --> 00:43:10,093
Come on, Deb,
it's only two days.

795
00:43:10,157 --> 00:43:11,630
I know, I know.
It's just --

796
00:43:11,676 --> 00:43:14,352
We've had a major break in
the ice-truck-killer case.

797
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:17,893
I promise, as soon as we
catch this douchebag,

798
00:43:18,005 --> 00:43:20,550
you and I are gonna spend a
whole week together in bed.

799
00:43:20,606 --> 00:43:22,842
You are not gonna be
able to get rid of me.

800
00:43:22,985 --> 00:43:24,050
Okay, okay but --

801
00:43:24,058 --> 00:43:27,310
- How about dinner?
- Oh, my God, you are persistent.

802
00:43:27,597 --> 00:43:29,670
Well,
you got to eat, right?

803
00:43:29,685 --> 00:43:32,060
So why not eat dinner
with me...

804
00:43:33,005 --> 00:43:34,873
on this yacht I'm on?

805
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:36,303
Where the hell did
you get a yacht?

806
00:43:36,407 --> 00:43:37,750
I rented it.

807
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:40,441
I thought we'd have a nice
couple days together, but

808
00:43:40,478 --> 00:43:42,483
we could still
have a nice night.

809
00:43:42,976 --> 00:43:45,842
And there is that thing
we need to talk about...

810
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:50,350
Okay, well, maybe I can take
an hour for dinner.

811
00:43:50,407 --> 00:43:51,912
I can work with an hour.

812
00:43:51,956 --> 00:43:53,590
I mean, a real hour,
not one of your

813
00:43:53,626 --> 00:43:55,700
"let's stretch this
out till 2:00 a.m.

814
00:43:55,738 --> 00:43:57,900
you might as well stay
and have sex" hours.

815
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:00,853
Right.

816
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:03,700
Real hour. No fakey hour.
Got it.

817
00:44:03,747 --> 00:44:05,351
All right, I'll get out of here
as fast as I can.

818
00:44:05,507 --> 00:44:07,011
I'll see you soon.

819
00:44:15,106 --> 00:44:17,952
<i>Thinking Rudy attacked Batista
doesn't make any sense.</i>

820
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,271
<i>He's a loving boyfriend.</i>

821
00:44:19,306 --> 00:44:21,553
<i>He spends his life
helping people in need.</i>

822
00:44:22,028 --> 00:44:23,603
<i>He brought me steaks.</i>

823
00:44:25,176 --> 00:44:27,051
<i>Well, that's just rude.</i>

824
00:44:27,615 --> 00:44:29,323
<i>Why would loving
and helpful Rudy</i>

825
00:44:29,355 --> 00:44:31,340
<i>need an industrial-grade lock?</i>

826
00:44:32,567 --> 00:44:34,631
<i>And a security camera?</i>

827
00:44:35,728 --> 00:44:38,333
<i>How do I get his DNA now?</i>

828
00:44:57,097 --> 00:44:58,352
<i>At times like this,</i>

829
00:44:58,408 --> 00:45:01,203
<i>I wish the truth was
more easily accessible,</i>

830
00:45:01,507 --> 00:45:02,902
<i>and less --</i>

831
00:45:03,286 --> 00:45:04,463
<i>ripe.</i>

832
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:08,313
<i>But Harry taught me
to trust my gut.</i>

833
00:45:08,685 --> 00:45:10,980
<i>"People lie all
the time," he said.</i>

834
00:45:11,545 --> 00:45:14,403
<i>"But your instinct
will never fail you."</i>

835
00:45:16,207 --> 00:45:19,423
<i>Some blood from
a cut lip, perhaps?</i>

836
00:45:28,037 --> 00:45:29,671
[Fuck me!]

837
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:33,920
I believe your rule specifically
prohibits such action.

838
00:45:39,505 --> 00:45:41,300
Did you do all this?

839
00:45:41,585 --> 00:45:43,610
In fact --
I did.

840
00:45:44,206 --> 00:45:45,503
You like?

841
00:45:46,136 --> 00:45:47,391
I like.

842
00:45:48,456 --> 00:45:51,602
I like so much that it makes what I
have to tell you that much harder.

843
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,172
Oh, please tell me
you're not leaving.

844
00:45:53,207 --> 00:45:54,220
I'm sorry.

845
00:45:54,257 --> 00:45:56,402
I hit traffic. It took
me 30 minutes to get here.

846
00:45:56,457 --> 00:45:58,473
I have to turn around
and go right back.

847
00:45:59,955 --> 00:46:01,951
Oh, my God.
Hold on.

848
00:46:01,986 --> 00:46:03,382
Hold on.
Wait!

849
00:46:03,456 --> 00:46:05,053
Well, you're sort of
forcing my hand here.

850
00:46:05,157 --> 00:46:07,503
I wanted to wait until we
were out in the water, but...

851
00:46:08,738 --> 00:46:10,000
Here it goes.

852
00:46:11,575 --> 00:46:13,651
I know this seems fast...

853
00:46:13,988 --> 00:46:15,242
But I feel --

854
00:46:16,217 --> 00:46:19,202
I feel that I waited my
whole entire life for you.

855
00:46:20,018 --> 00:46:21,800
And now that you're here,

856
00:46:21,956 --> 00:46:23,952
I don't want you to leave.

857
00:46:25,957 --> 00:46:28,010
Debra Morgan...

858
00:46:28,198 --> 00:46:29,653
Will you marry me?

859
00:46:30,898 --> 00:46:32,671
I knew it!
I fucking knew it!

860
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,152
Is that your version
of a "yes"?

861
00:46:34,175 --> 00:46:37,230
Yes, yes, yes, yes, but --

862
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:39,953
No, no, no!
Stop at "yes." "Yes", I like that part.

863
00:46:40,237 --> 00:46:42,913
Yes, but let's slow it down,
you know?

864
00:46:43,147 --> 00:46:46,190
Like, let me savor this.
I want to be with you.

865
00:46:46,426 --> 00:46:49,853
I want to enjoy it, you know?
So it's a "yes," but --

866
00:46:50,086 --> 00:46:51,960
- Okay, I get it.
- You do?

867
00:46:52,007 --> 00:46:53,622
No, not really,
but I can work with it.

868
00:46:53,655 --> 00:46:55,421
Good, good.

869
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,953
Oh, God, I can still wear
the ring, right?

870
00:46:58,456 --> 00:47:00,283
Yes, but...

871
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,830
There's a condition.

872
00:47:02,288 --> 00:47:04,133
I know you have to
go to work, but...

873
00:47:04,848 --> 00:47:07,522
If you're gonna wear the ring,
we need to celebrate.

874
00:47:07,807 --> 00:47:10,381
One glass of champagne.
That's all I ask.

875
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:12,392
- Rudy, I --
- I mean it.

876
00:47:12,428 --> 00:47:13,652
You can't leave
your sort-of fianc?

877
00:47:13,686 --> 00:47:15,173
on a yacht
with a cold meal

878
00:47:15,206 --> 00:47:17,712
and an unopened bottle of champagne.
It's kind of cruel.

879
00:47:17,948 --> 00:47:20,233
Just one glass
of champagne...

880
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:22,261
to celebrate.

881
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:23,602
And then you can go back,

882
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:26,103
saving Miami from
the ice-truck killer.

883
00:47:27,337 --> 00:47:28,553
I can live with that.

884
00:47:34,957 --> 00:47:37,322
Hey, I need these two
tested against each other.

885
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:38,731
It's kind of a rush.

886
00:47:39,825 --> 00:47:41,841
Excuse me, hi.

887
00:47:43,878 --> 00:47:47,012
Hey, these two --
Tested against each other right now.

888
00:47:47,057 --> 00:47:48,053
Okay.

889
00:47:53,355 --> 00:47:55,280
<i>It's Deb.
Do it.</i>

890
00:47:55,608 --> 00:47:56,953
Hey, I know you're working,

891
00:47:57,148 --> 00:47:59,972
but let me know when you come up
for air. I need to talk to you.

892
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:01,693
I'm in the building.

893
00:48:08,108 --> 00:48:09,991
This yacht's amazing.

894
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:12,603
I didn't know you went
for stuff like this.

895
00:48:12,797 --> 00:48:15,461
Well, you have a whole
lot to learn about me.

896
00:48:15,555 --> 00:48:17,003
Was that just the
phone ringing?

897
00:48:17,065 --> 00:48:18,873
Yeah --
Big brother.

898
00:48:19,006 --> 00:48:21,367
I let it go to voice mail.
He can wait till we're done here.

899
00:48:21,367 --> 00:48:23,973
Good.
I want you all to myself.

900
00:48:25,037 --> 00:48:25,713
So...

901
00:48:26,418 --> 00:48:29,503
let the toasting begin.
To...

902
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,790
what comes next.

903
00:48:37,068 --> 00:48:41,013
You're not drinking?

904
00:48:46,698 --> 00:48:48,520
Tastes like menthol,

905
00:48:48,757 --> 00:48:51,102
which, it turns out,
is not that sexy.

906
00:48:57,105 --> 00:48:58,553
What's the matter?

907
00:48:58,708 --> 00:48:59,961
Nothing.

908
00:49:02,308 --> 00:49:04,050
Just bad memories.

909
00:49:07,055 --> 00:49:08,981
That's right.
That was the --

910
00:49:09,056 --> 00:49:10,152
the one clue

911
00:49:10,306 --> 00:49:13,030
the ice-truck killer
left behind, right?

912
00:49:13,585 --> 00:49:14,370
Right.

913
00:49:16,406 --> 00:49:18,502
Wait.
How did you know that?

914
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:21,130
I don't often make mistakes,

915
00:49:21,328 --> 00:49:24,281
but when I do,
they haunt me.

916
00:49:25,577 --> 00:49:27,123
Hilarious.

917
00:49:29,065 --> 00:49:31,361
Your champagne's
gonna get warm.

918
00:49:31,406 --> 00:49:32,603
You know the one thing

919
00:49:32,638 --> 00:49:34,742
I've been dying to ask you?

920
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:37,621
How did you not know
who I was?

921
00:49:38,587 --> 00:49:40,113
You're a cop.

922
00:49:43,228 --> 00:49:45,190
This isn't funny.

923
00:49:45,378 --> 00:49:48,133
I think a real cop would...

924
00:49:48,207 --> 00:49:50,131
at least have a sense that
she was in the presence

925
00:49:50,206 --> 00:49:53,990
of the person she
was hunting. Right?

926
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:55,911
You're hurting me.

927
00:49:56,105 --> 00:49:58,251
I didn't show you the
best part of my loft.

928
00:49:58,306 --> 00:50:00,163
Built it myself.

929
00:50:01,507 --> 00:50:02,600
Stop it!

930
00:50:02,838 --> 00:50:05,692
The refrigerated room.

931
00:50:06,357 --> 00:50:08,703
Oh, God,
why are you doing this?!

932
00:50:08,808 --> 00:50:10,903
You know, the tricky part
was getting you on the boat.

933
00:50:11,858 --> 00:50:13,720
The other women
I could just pay.

934
00:50:14,158 --> 00:50:16,451
But at the end...

935
00:50:16,826 --> 00:50:18,583
You made it easy.

936
00:50:19,715 --> 00:50:22,742
So desperate to fall in love.

937
00:50:25,588 --> 00:50:26,520
Stop.

938
00:50:41,348 --> 00:50:43,872
Dude, you got to see this.

939
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:47,301
The autopsy on our Santa's
cottage victim? Check it out.

940
00:50:47,905 --> 00:50:52,323
One arm was shorter than the other.
So that got me thinking.

941
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,903
I mean, our guy isn't sloppy.

942
00:50:55,095 --> 00:50:57,043
- He's precise.
- Not now, Vince.

943
00:50:57,225 --> 00:51:00,370
Her left wrist was 2 inches
shorter than her right.

944
00:51:00,608 --> 00:51:04,601
I mean, why? Why cut off more
on the left side than the right?

945
00:51:04,996 --> 00:51:06,973
Because our girl...

946
00:51:07,007 --> 00:51:09,253
Our girl was
a fucking amputee.

947
00:51:10,758 --> 00:51:12,530
I looked up her
medical records.

948
00:51:13,135 --> 00:51:16,100
She had a fake left hand.
That's why we couldn't find it.

949
00:51:16,236 --> 00:51:18,430
The killer cut off that
extra piece of wrist

950
00:51:18,525 --> 00:51:20,082
so that we wouldn't
see the stump.

951
00:51:20,117 --> 00:51:20,912
Let me see that.

952
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:23,881
That night Batista was stabbed,

953
00:51:24,115 --> 00:51:27,593
he was following up on a lead he
got from a one-handed call girl.

954
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:29,721
Guess what the lead was about.

955
00:51:30,816 --> 00:51:32,650
The ice-truck killer.

956
00:51:33,585 --> 00:51:34,602
Booyah.

957
00:51:39,227 --> 00:51:41,563
- You sure?
- Positive.

958
00:51:41,606 --> 00:51:43,037
The samples you gave me
were a match.

959
00:51:43,037 --> 00:51:44,603
They're from the same person.

960
00:51:46,406 --> 00:51:47,903
Hey, you all right?

961
00:51:55,636 --> 00:51:57,463
Where's my sister?

962
00:51:57,695 --> 00:52:00,511
Took her code 12.
Left about an hour ago.

963
00:52:00,608 --> 00:52:03,280
She went to dinner?
She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

964
00:52:03,315 --> 00:52:05,002
Dispatch, this is
Dexter Morgan.

965
00:52:05,186 --> 00:52:08,471
I need you to raise officer
Debra Morgan on her radio.

966
00:52:12,915 --> 00:52:15,863
Sorry, sir. She's been out of
range for the last half-hour.

967
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,802
<i>It's Deb.
Do it.</i>

968
00:52:20,907 --> 00:52:22,220
Where the fuck are you?

969
00:52:22,255 --> 00:52:24,402
I'm here at work, and you're not.
I need to talk to you.

970
00:52:24,567 --> 00:52:27,071
Do not see Rudy
until you find me.

971
00:52:27,817 --> 00:52:29,403
Call me when you get this.
