1
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:48,488
Previously on "dexter"...

2
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:49,840
dexter: No blood.

3
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:51,802
What a beautiful idea.

4
00:01:51,803 --> 00:01:53,166
Refrigerated truck.

5
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:56,411
He wants a cold environment...

6
00:01:56,412 --> 00:01:58,819
to slow the flow of blood.

7
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,043
I suppose I should be upset,

8
00:02:01,263 --> 00:02:02,361
but I'm not.

9
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:05,199
In fact, I think this is a friendly message,

10
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,049
kind of like,"hey, want to play?"

11
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:11,116
Kara, it's me.It's james.

12
00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:14,638
You just opened a dangerous door.

13
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,267
No, man.You did...

14
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:19,496
when you murdered a cop and an innocent lady.

15
00:02:19,497 --> 00:02:23,150
Was kara sleeping with someone other than ricky?

16
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:25,021
Was it you?

17
00:02:26,032 --> 00:02:27,664
What the fuck were you thinking?

18
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:31,235
-- Going out tonight with the guys, blow off steam. You in?
-- Hey, man.Sounds good.

19
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:34,437
I thought you said you wanted to go get shit-faced.

20
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:36,287
I am shit-faced.

21
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:39,639
I showed my face to guerrero, his whole church.

22
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,109
They're gonna think I'm behind this shit.

23
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,772
You fucked my sister.

24
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:44,386
You fucked a cop's wife.

25
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:47,709
Now you're just fucked, buddy.

26
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,505
He's escalating the thrill,

27
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:54,650
posing his victim in the middle of a 20,000-seat arena for all miami to see,

28
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:56,983
to show us what he's capable of doing.

29
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:58,512
What did I miss?

30
00:02:58,513 --> 00:02:59,302
Fingertips.

31
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:01,634
Fuckin'-a, that's my girl.

32
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:04,401
This body belongs to the frozen fingertips in the truck.

33
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:05,843
Ladies and gentlemen,

34
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:08,206
I give you tony tucci,

35
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:09,870
the ice-truck killer.

36
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:10,638
Bullshit.

37
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,536
Of course I agree with my sister,

38
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:14,856
but unlike her, I'm not upset.

39
00:03:14,857 --> 00:03:18,342
He's still out there, and I'm waiting...

40
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:20,526
breathless.

41
00:03:36,578 --> 00:03:39,909
I find people around me are always making some kind of connection,

42
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,039
like friendship or romance,

43
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:46,219
but human bonds always lead to messy complications --

44
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,626
commitment, sharing,

45
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:51,264
driving people to the airport.

46
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:55,991
Besides, if I let someone get that close, they'd see who I really am...

47
00:03:56,298 --> 00:03:58,563
and I can't let that happen.

48
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:02,997
So... time to put on my mask.

49
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:07,460
I need your expertise.

50
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:09,045
I live to serve.

51
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:11,000
Excuse us, fellas.

52
00:04:15,597 --> 00:04:18,064
Interesting hand job.

53
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:20,385
That's funny.

54
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:22,948
It is?

55
00:04:24,124 --> 00:04:26,222
So, how long you think it's been there?

56
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,993
This feels familiar.

57
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:34,215
Okay.

58
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,543
So, how long's it been there?

59
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,195
Blood stopped pooling,

60
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:43,488
still wet... couple hours at the most.

61
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:44,780
What time was it found?

62
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:48,037
A jogger called it in this morning about 7:30.

63
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,075
No prints.Wiped clean.

64
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:51,454
Real creep show, huh?

65
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:53,287
Any sign of the rest of the body?

66
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:55,179
Just mr. Hand.

67
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,593
Do you think this is our guy's work?

68
00:04:57,594 --> 00:04:59,463
The ice-truck killer?

69
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:03,451
It's hard to say.There's blood.That's different.

70
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:06,990
Plus, it's a male victim --haven't seen that before.

71
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:10,346
The cut appears to be almost delicate.

72
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:13,135
You see between the first and second row of carpals --

73
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,892
very surgical.

74
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,883
Check out what else he left behind.

75
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:23,241
A little postcard

76
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:25,411
to remember him by.

77
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:32,497
How far is rand beach from here?

78
00:05:32,552 --> 00:05:34,223
This is rand beach.

79
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:37,749
It was renamed petrie beach a few years ago.

80
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,074
Okay, everybody.

81
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:58,379
Everybody say "stinky feet."

82
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,709
Stinky feet!

83
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:02,158
Wait. Nobody move.

84
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,354
Dexter, were you smiling?

85
00:06:03,355 --> 00:06:04,332
No.

86
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,288
Okay, we'll do another one.

87
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:07,573
This time, everybody smiles.You, too, dex.

88
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:09,144
Yeah, pretend you're burning ants.

89
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:10,765
Shut your damn face, deb.

90
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:12,299
Hey, language, please.

91
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,788
What? She always talks like that.

92
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:15,326
Enough, you two.

93
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:16,867
Dexter, come here.

94
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:23,529
What's your problem?

95
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,208
I hate the beach.
It's sandy and gross and nasty, and I want to go home.

96
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:27,957
Too bad.

97
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,389
You're part of a family.

98
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,707
And being part of a family means smiling for photos.

99
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:36,661
Why should I pretend I'm happy?

100
00:06:37,518 --> 00:06:40,512
Because it'll make your mom happy,

101
00:06:41,196 --> 00:06:43,072
and because it's how you fit in.

102
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:44,832
Remember we talked about that?

103
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,109
Yeah.

104
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,620
This is how you do it.

105
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:49,369
When somebody takes your picture, you smile.

106
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,945
It doesn't matter if you're happy or not.

107
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:54,150
You just do it to fit in.

108
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,074
-- Okay?
-- Okay.

109
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:58,236
All right.

110
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:00,964
Come here, handsome.

111
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:03,247
Okay.

112
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:05,618
Everybody ready?

113
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,081
One more time.

114
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:13,839
Stinky feet!

115
00:07:16,481 --> 00:07:19,611
Yeah, I just need to stop by my apartment to pick up a few labs.

116
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:22,553
Straight to the station after, yeah. Thanks, lieutenant.

117
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,716
Dexter morgan,

118
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:38,631
this is your life.

119
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:44,402
It is my new friend --the ice-truck killer.

120
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:47,996
When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

121
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,601
my life..

122
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:54,239
my secrets.

123
00:08:04,196 --> 00:08:08,504
...Have even brought in manpower from other counties
in an effort to expedite the search.

124
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:11,255
Officially, mr. Tucci has not been charged with any crime...

125
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:14,283
then tell the fucking governor to free up funds for overtime.

126
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:18,865
I mean The more guys I got out there, the sooner we find tucci.

127
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:21,123
Uh, kelly,I'll get back to you.

128
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:23,431
...Is still the department's top priority.

129
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:26,897
What's wrong?

130
00:08:26,898 --> 00:08:29,610
Fingerprint I.D. Came back on that hand from the beach.

131
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:31,206
It belongs to tony tucci,

132
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:33,699
your ice-truck killer suspect.

133
00:08:34,086 --> 00:08:35,350
What?

134
00:08:38,228 --> 00:08:40,085
Wait a minute.

135
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:44,476
No. No, no, no.No way.

136
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,517
No way.

137
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:47,651
I mean, this --

138
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,030
this has to be a mistake.

139
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:54,878
The mistake was unleashing a high-profile manhunt before you had all the facts.

140
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:03,303
Okay.

141
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,564
This doesn't mean that tucci is not the killer.

142
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:07,199
Don'T.

143
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,602
Just -- just don'T.

144
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:13,093
You wanted to be on tv --well, get ready...

145
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,809
'cause the press will annihilate us for this.

146
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,499
We'll be lucky if tucci's mother doesn't file a lawsuit.

147
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:23,213
All right.

148
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,013
You go talk to that woman.

149
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:27,630
Do your mea culpas.

150
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:30,146
If we handle this right,

151
00:09:30,147 --> 00:09:31,686
maybe we can mitigate the fallout.

152
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:33,494
Tom...

153
00:09:34,597 --> 00:09:36,655
I'm the last person she wants to see.

154
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:38,680
I called her son a killer.

155
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:41,665
And now's your chance to make it right.

156
00:10:01,174 --> 00:10:03,190
*************

157
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:04,424
I'm taking point.

158
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:07,244
You can help by getting all nonessentials off the beach.

159
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:09,082
Secure and separate any witnesses, all right?

160
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,273
Will do.

161
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:12,231
What did the captain say?

162
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:14,010
Did he make her cry?

163
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,109
Just control the fucking beach, angel.

164
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:25,978
I knew tucci wasn't the killer.I knew it.

165
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:28,777
Laguerta whipped up a manhunt r a rent-a-cop.

166
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:31,400
Oh, man, I wish I could have been there to see the captain rip her a new one.

167
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:32,996
Morgan, calm down.

168
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:35,253
Laguerta insulted the real killer's intelligence,

169
00:10:35,254 --> 00:10:38,665
and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

170
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,026
You see all these people over here?

171
00:10:40,027 --> 00:10:40,702
Yeah.

172
00:10:40,703 --> 00:10:42,463
What are they?

173
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:43,909
Uh, potential witnesses.

174
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,873
And what do we do with potential witnesses, morgan?

175
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:49,676
We --we interview them.

176
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:51,304
Got it.

177
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:02,771
Where is he...

178
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:06,387
the rest of him?

179
00:11:08,697 --> 00:11:11,178
We're --we're still looking.

180
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:12,407
The entire force is looking.

181
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:13,644
We're making every effort.

182
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:14,915
Are you sure it's tony?

183
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,806
Because...

184
00:11:16,898 --> 00:11:18,326
yes.

185
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,842
I'm afraid so.

186
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,080
Mrs. Tucci...

187
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,469
I said some very harsh things about your son.

188
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,544
Thank you.

189
00:11:38,178 --> 00:11:40,780
"Thank you"? For what?

190
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,685
For coming to tell me in person.

191
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:46,535
For god's sake, please.

192
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:48,614
There's nothing more important than this.

193
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:52,046
Can you find my son's body?

194
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:55,028
If it's the last thing I do.

195
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:59,926
-- I made a grave --
-- bring him home, please.

196
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,310
I just want to bury my son.

197
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:19,393
I do love halloween.

198
00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:21,206
What's inside of a pumpkin?

199
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,716
See for yourself.

200
00:12:24,303 --> 00:12:25,849
You don't like this stuff? I do.

201
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,696
Come on.Get in there.

202
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:34,093
I'll finish cleaning this out.You can carve it tomorrow.

203
00:12:35,394 --> 00:12:37,522
There he is again, mom.

204
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:39,686
My god.It's every night now.

205
00:12:39,687 --> 00:12:42,016
That dog? Where's it coming from?

206
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:43,997
Next door --my neighbor'S.

207
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,821
Leaves the poor thing in the yard all day and night.

208
00:12:46,822 --> 00:12:47,841
It's been getting worse.

209
00:12:47,842 --> 00:12:52,033
I mean, I would talk to her, but I don't want to start something.

210
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:54,753
Listen to him, mom.He's so sad.

211
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:57,755
I just wish he would shut up so I could sleep.

212
00:12:57,756 --> 00:12:59,982
Do you want me to talk to her?

213
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:02,672
No, you don't have to do that.

214
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:07,563
I insist.

215
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,534
Hello.

216
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,314
I don't think we've meet

217
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:35,255
boyfriend of the blonde next door.

218
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:36,257
I've seen you around.

219
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:38,022
Look, I'm just getting in.I'm tired.

220
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:39,180
That's precisely why I'm here.

221
00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:42,960
We can't help but notice your dog, uh, cries...

222
00:13:43,164 --> 00:13:44,716
-- a lot.
-- I know.

223
00:13:44,717 --> 00:13:46,663
My ex moved out and left his dog.

224
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,113
Oh.

225
00:13:48,114 --> 00:13:50,373
Trust me, I wish there was something I could do.

226
00:13:50,374 --> 00:13:53,685
You could, uh, take him inside.

227
00:13:53,977 --> 00:13:55,480
Walter's an outside dog.

228
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:57,550
You put walter inside, walter's an inside dog.

229
00:13:57,551 --> 00:14:00,346
He doesn't like being inside.

230
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:02,870
Did he tell you that?

231
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:09,826
We'd appreciate it if you could find a way to keep him quiet.

232
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:11,211
The kids are upset.

233
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:16,326
Maybe that's 'cause they think their crackhead father is gonna come back and beat their asses again.

234
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:19,086
You know what works for me?

235
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:21,042
Earplugs.

236
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:33,573
I could make things so much easier for rita...

237
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,576
but that would be wrong.

238
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:46,796
I love halloween --

239
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:49,229
the one time of year when everyone wears a mask...

240
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,076
not just me.

241
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,678
People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster.

242
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,975
Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.

243
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:05,720
Brother, friend, boyfriend --all part of my costume collection.

244
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:11,457
Some people might call me a fraud.

245
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:13,640
Let's see if it will fit.

246
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:19,860
You stabbed me in the back!

247
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:23,830
I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise.

248
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,311
They're so excited.

249
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:30,365
Sure they are. They get to binge on sugar for an entire day.

250
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:31,894
Who wouldn't love that?

251
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:33,363
What about a costume for you?

252
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:34,838
Maybe this one?

253
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:39,561
no. No. I think I'll be snow white again.

254
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:40,941
It's kind of tradition.

255
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:42,155
Oh.

256
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,910
Dexter, look.I'm a princess, too.

257
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:48,307
Just like your mom --two perfect princesses.

258
00:15:48,965 --> 00:15:50,419
Let me guess.You're gonna be a dwarf.

259
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,122
No way. I want to be joe from "blue's clues."

260
00:15:54,123 --> 00:15:58,456
I keep telling him that a rugby shirt is not a costume.

261
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:08,443
Another photo from my family album.

262
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:12,912
He's re-creating my past with tony tucci's body parts.

263
00:16:13,224 --> 00:16:15,460
He's forcing me to see this.

264
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:18,852
Nobody paying you to stand around and goddamn stare.

265
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,705
I thought angel was working this case, sergeant.

266
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:24,873
Sergeant?

267
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:29,915
Friends of yours?

268
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:31,020
Don't worry about it.

269
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:32,980
Worry about this.

270
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:36,116
The foot was severed between the tarsus and the metatarsus.

271
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:39,340
The wound is circular --again, almost surgical.

272
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:41,692
And there's blood.

273
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:43,395
Guy gives us body after body with no blood.

274
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:45,509
Why he's making a switch now?

275
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,121
He's trying to send a message --

276
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:53,008
one that's more important than his ritual need to drain the blood and wrap the parts.

277
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:55,421
Okay, so what's the message?

278
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:56,793
I'm not sure.

279
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:59,050
Well, who's he sending it to?

280
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:02,367
I can't tell you that, either.

281
00:17:03,347 --> 00:17:05,610
What fucking good are you?

282
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:09,738
No fucking good at all, apparently.

283
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,000
You okay?

284
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,733
he's mocking me.

285
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:19,319
Don't take it personal.

286
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,265
Doakes hates all you lab geeks.

287
00:17:21,603 --> 00:17:23,827
Who? Oh.

288
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:25,613
-- Relax, bro.
-- Sorry.

289
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:27,128
I need to bag this photo

290
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,006
under the ball. Do you mind?

291
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,489
He knows.

292
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,062
He's not corrupting the happy hallmark images of my youth.

293
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:57,504
He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

294
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,019
Come on, simon.

295
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,155
You want it?

296
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:02,485
It's right there.

297
00:18:02,486 --> 00:18:04,790
-- Over there.
-- Oh, yeah.

298
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:06,987
Guys, give it back! Pass it over here.

299
00:18:06,988 --> 00:18:09,556
You guys, give it back.Come on, simon.

300
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:10,455
What you gonna do?

301
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,074
All right.Enough.

302
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,423
Get out of here.

303
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:23,341
What the hell is going on?

304
00:18:23,342 --> 00:18:24,415
We're just having fun.

305
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,079
It didn't look like simon was having too much fun.

306
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,518
You're always telling me to fit in, and I'm just trying to be part of the team.

307
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,603
You can't be a bully, dexter.

308
00:18:33,884 --> 00:18:35,629
First of all it's wrong.

309
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,068
Secondly, people remember bullies.

310
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:40,375
People like me --cops.

311
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:43,691
A bully is a felony waiting to happen.

312
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:46,335
So...

313
00:18:46,336 --> 00:18:48,196
blend in.

314
00:18:49,385 --> 00:18:50,948
Go on.

315
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:03,348
Officer morgan, I have an assignment for you.

316
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:05,034
I heard we found a foot this morning.

317
00:19:05,035 --> 00:19:06,820
You want me to head out to the crime scene?

318
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:08,576
No.

319
00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:11,837
Look, we pulled these from security cameras around the beach --

320
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:14,036
stores, hotels, atms.

321
00:19:14,037 --> 00:19:16,260
I want you to check every frame.

322
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:17,719
Oh, you are shitting me.

323
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,315
If we're lucky, we can see the ice-truck killer coming and going.

324
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:22,276
We have techs who can do this.

325
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:26,040
Not all techs have the skill to spot suspicious activity.

326
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,726
I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.

327
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:30,852
Keep your eye out for another box of surveillance tapes.

328
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:33,681
It's on its way from the new crime scene.

329
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:58,698
Hey, doakes, what's up?

330
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:01,459
Fuck anyone's wife lately?

331
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:07,585
Thanks to your little chickenshit stunt,

332
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:09,551
guerrero's guys are tailing me everywhere I go.

333
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:10,509
Did you know that?

334
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,089
That's not good, james.

335
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,135
You should alert the police...

336
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:17,525
unless, of course, for some reason the officers of miami metro wouldn't want to help you --

337
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:20,307
like, you know, you fucked one of their wives.

338
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:22,424
You think this is a joke.

339
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:25,741
I'm gonna end up dead.It's just a matter of when.

340
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:29,395
You should have thought of that before you stuck your dick in my sister.

341
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,280
You're right.

342
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,683
I should have waited until the divorce came through.

343
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,331
Bullshit.

344
00:20:38,464 --> 00:20:41,027
What? She didn't tell you?

345
00:20:41,028 --> 00:20:44,062
She filed the papers, jackass.

346
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:45,239
You don't believe me, ask the captain.

347
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,734
He tried to pull ricky out of his assignment, but ricky didn't want to come out.

348
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:50,635
Of course not. His job was to bring down guerrero.

349
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:54,352
It was his job to protect his wife.

350
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:58,958
Ricky's the motherfucker who got her killed.

351
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,922
You backed the wrong cop, asshole.

352
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:09,493
Let's go, guys.Time for school.

353
00:21:10,797 --> 00:21:13,297
Guys? Come on.

354
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:16,060
You don't want to be in the halloween parade?

355
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:24,499
Shut up!

356
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:27,740
Shut up! Just --

357
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,248
I need to talk to you about your dog.

358
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,418
I talked to your boyfriend.

359
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:35,078
My kids are exhausted.

360
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:38,465
All right, when it comes to my kids, I stop being nice.

361
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,375
So I need you to bring him in at night, feed him on a schedule,

362
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:45,786
and take him for some exercise every now and --

363
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:48,075
I'm sorry.

364
00:21:48,076 --> 00:21:49,479
Is this funny?

365
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,399
No, no, no.

366
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,868
It's -- it's sad.

367
00:21:51,898 --> 00:21:53,248
But you're funny.

368
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:55,598
Look at you, all tough.

369
00:21:57,781 --> 00:22:00,870
I-I'm gonna call the police.I can do that.

370
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:02,499
There's nothing you can do.

371
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,882
The cops will tell meto keep him quiet,

372
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:09,057
and I'll say I will, and then they'll leave, and he'll go back to doing what he does.

373
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:12,324
But you're funny.

374
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:46,493
Unlike harry, my new friend doesn't place much value in blending in.

375
00:22:46,494 --> 00:22:50,108
He wants me to see who he is and what he does.

376
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:55,104
Everything about him is brazen, authentic.

377
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:58,562
What does that make me?

378
00:22:58,932 --> 00:23:00,649
Crap.

379
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:08,851
You okay, man?

380
00:23:08,852 --> 00:23:09,795
No.

381
00:23:09,796 --> 00:23:12,127
Hey, don't let this bastard get to you.

382
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,574
You're the best blood expert in the state,

383
00:23:14,575 --> 00:23:16,419
and we need you to stay with this, my friend.

384
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,517
I'll be all right.

385
00:23:18,518 --> 00:23:20,934
Wait.Before you get back to work,

386
00:23:20,935 --> 00:23:22,869
check this out.

387
00:23:26,564 --> 00:23:27,988
What is that, a butterfly?

388
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,139
No, socio,

389
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,310
it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.

390
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,781
I'm, uh,

391
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:37,938
I'm giving it to nina for our anniversary tomorrow night.

392
00:23:37,939 --> 00:23:39,814
Oh, congratulations.

393
00:23:39,815 --> 00:23:40,955
How many years?

394
00:23:40,956 --> 00:23:43,946
10 years she's been my lucky charm now.

395
00:23:43,947 --> 00:23:48,882
Tin is the traditional gift, but I didn't think she'd want a tin clover.

396
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,162
No.It's probably a good plan.

397
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,173
Are you sure that's not a butterfly?

398
00:23:55,724 --> 00:23:59,428
Well, it does kind of look like a bug.

399
00:24:02,185 --> 00:24:04,221
This can't be right.

400
00:24:04,614 --> 00:24:05,631
What's up?

401
00:24:05,674 --> 00:24:08,470
You see that? You see it?

402
00:24:08,471 --> 00:24:09,744
I don't know.What do I see?

403
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:13,591
The blood flow in the hand suggested the heart was still pumping when it was severed.

404
00:24:13,592 --> 00:24:15,789
Mean son of a bitch, no doubt.

405
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,352
But look at the foot.It's the same blood flow, plus the lividity.

406
00:24:19,353 --> 00:24:23,846
Look, it's the same bruising, same ashen color, same level of decomposition

407
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:26,360
as the hand the day we found it.

408
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:27,673
But...

409
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:29,170
we found them a day apart.

410
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:30,927
I know.

411
00:24:34,068 --> 00:24:35,623
Los santos.

412
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:37,583
Hollywood, fl--

413
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:40,150
L.T.,You got to listen to him.

414
00:24:40,151 --> 00:24:42,320
It's the guard, tucci --

415
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:44,098
I think he's alive.

416
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:46,034
What are you talking about?

417
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:50,970
The ice-truck killer is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

418
00:24:50,971 --> 00:24:52,308
Tucci's alive?

419
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:54,920
Both limbs were taken from a live body,

420
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:57,300
and we found them 24 hours apart.

421
00:24:57,302 --> 00:24:58,485
That's not all.

422
00:24:58,486 --> 00:24:59,486
Tell them, dexter.

423
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:03,210
If the hand came off yesterday at 7:00 A.M.And the foot this morning at 7:00...

424
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,600
we get another body part first thing tomorrow.

425
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:07,672
But he's alive.

426
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,881
Put together a task force.I want all available personnel on this,

427
00:25:10,882 --> 00:25:14,594
and put a priority status on all forensics related to this case.

428
00:25:14,595 --> 00:25:16,343
Captain matthews, please.

429
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,678
Have him call me back immediately.

430
00:25:43,696 --> 00:25:46,092
Mrs. Tucci?

431
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:48,673
Maria laguerta.

432
00:25:49,412 --> 00:25:52,590
I have some amazing news for you.

433
00:25:52,591 --> 00:25:56,331
We believe your son is alive.

434
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,540
No. No. We haven't, but I promise we will.

435
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:05,015
No, thank you.

436
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:07,532
Yes. Yes.

437
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:10,159
Okay, we'll be in touch.Bye.

438
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:18,557
Doakes: We've got a live body now, people.

439
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:20,735
We want to find tucci while he's still breathing.

440
00:26:20,736 --> 00:26:23,602
That means trying to figure out where tomorrow's drop is

441
00:26:23,603 --> 00:26:25,435
so we catch our man in the act.

442
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:27,425
Any ideas?

443
00:26:28,598 --> 00:26:30,905
Don't forget the photos.They're new.

444
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:34,952
Thank you, officer morgan.We're doing just fine out here.

445
00:26:34,953 --> 00:26:36,910
Why do we think he's taking photos?

446
00:26:36,911 --> 00:26:38,652
He wants to be remembered.

447
00:26:38,653 --> 00:26:41,561
You use photos to record memories.

448
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:44,430
I almost feel sorry for them,

449
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:48,252
trying to put together a puzzle when they don't know pieces are missing from the box --

450
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:51,203
pieces he gave me.

451
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:58,116
He wants me to play the game his way.

452
00:26:59,441 --> 00:27:01,440
Okay, what else could it be?

453
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:03,283
Change.

454
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:07,341
You got something to say, speak up.

455
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:12,322
The beach changed names.The office park used to be a soccer field.

456
00:27:12,323 --> 00:27:16,958
He's dumping the body parts in places that used to be something else.

457
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,832
Okay.Places that have changed.

458
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:20,059
Let's make a list,

459
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,573
assign surveillance to each location for the morning.

460
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:25,409
South beach used to be a mangrove swamp.

461
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,326
Homestead park was originally an air force base, right?

462
00:27:28,327 --> 00:27:32,207
They turned versace's mansion into a hotel.

463
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,566
Thank you, officer morgan.

464
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:36,442
The whole city of miami reinvents itself every 5 years.

465
00:27:36,443 --> 00:27:39,899
Then we'll stay up all night until our list is complete.

466
00:27:39,915 --> 00:27:44,630
I once was lost

467
00:27:44,631 --> 00:27:52,008
but now I'm found was blind

468
00:27:52,221 --> 00:27:58,588
but now I see

469
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,815
lieutenant.

470
00:28:15,345 --> 00:28:16,879
Anything?

471
00:28:19,024 --> 00:28:24,273
Well, I am so glad you could make it.

472
00:28:24,274 --> 00:28:27,470
Well, I just came by to show my support.

473
00:28:28,856 --> 00:28:32,247
It's been a long time since I've been to church.

474
00:28:33,502 --> 00:28:35,977
Excuse me, everyone.Excuse me.

475
00:28:35,978 --> 00:28:40,344
Um, I would like to introduce you to someone very special.

476
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:41,768
This is maria laguerta.

477
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:46,291
She's the policewoman looking for tony.

478
00:28:47,847 --> 00:28:49,204
Not just me.

479
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:52,465
Actually, there's a lot of us looking.

480
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:58,337
You brought us all here together by giving us hope.

481
00:29:01,397 --> 00:29:05,176
May the lord bless you

482
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:08,001
and guide you, maria.

483
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:10,415
This is saint anthony,

484
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:14,238
-- patron saint of
-- the lost.

485
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:19,044
Find him.

486
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,041
Okay.

487
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:25,964
I tried to apologize, but i couldn't get a word in edgewise.

488
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:27,516
And you wanted to apologize why?

489
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:30,902
You don't think I should, the way I went after her son?

490
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,358
Yeah, you did fuck that up.

491
00:29:33,615 --> 00:29:37,209
Yeah.I crucified him without having all the facts.

492
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:41,670
I need to tell her that I'm sorry.

493
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:45,761
I need to let her know that I'm sorry.I need to tell her.

494
00:29:45,762 --> 00:29:48,687
Who is that gonna make feel better, you or her?

495
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:52,722
Leave that woman alone with her candles and "kumbaya."

496
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,009
So, ere we at?

497
00:30:00,186 --> 00:30:03,727
I added additional patrols at dolphin stadium,

498
00:30:03,728 --> 00:30:06,225
bayside marketplace, and casa casuarina.

499
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,446
That's everybody we have out in the field --

500
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,561
homicide, robbery, off-duty patrol.

501
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:13,219
So what's next?

502
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,715
What's next is you should go home.

503
00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:17,829
You've had the shit kicked out of you all day.

504
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:21,591
I like it here with you.You're the only person people hate more than me.

505
00:30:23,785 --> 00:30:25,397
Come on.Let's both get out of here.

506
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:28,009
Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.

507
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:43,484
Officer morgan.

508
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:47,125
Call me on my cellphone if you find anything.

509
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,088
What? Huh?

510
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:18,293
Want a piece of me?

511
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,252
Fucking asshole!

512
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:27,913
Debra: I will pay you $1 million

513
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:31,716
if you help me figure out where the next piece of tucci's gonna show up.

514
00:31:32,042 --> 00:31:34,054
I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, deb.

515
00:31:34,055 --> 00:31:35,939
It's like it's staring me right in the face, but --

516
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,979
$1 million.

517
00:31:38,643 --> 00:31:39,904
You don't have $1 million.

518
00:31:39,905 --> 00:31:42,164
I'll steal it from evidence.

519
00:31:42,305 --> 00:31:44,671
I've been stuck in a goddamn fishbowl all day.

520
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:46,286
I want to be part of the hunt.

521
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:47,758
I'm almost off duty.

522
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,680
Sorry, sister.

523
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:51,641
$2 million.

524
00:31:52,016 --> 00:31:54,089
I know you made a list of locations.

525
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:57,157
Just pick your favorite spot.We'll stake it out together.

526
00:31:57,639 --> 00:31:59,805
My favorite spot.

527
00:31:59,806 --> 00:32:01,288
Of course.

528
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:04,195
Come on.I want to play.

529
00:32:08,036 --> 00:32:11,574
Deb, I got to go.We'll compare notes tomorrow, okay?

530
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:20,083
I used to love this place --

531
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:24,578
the bulldozers pressing garbage, layer after layer, right into the earth itself,

532
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:27,032
burying it, hiding it.

533
00:32:27,248 --> 00:32:29,490
I found it soothing.

534
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:35,983
But it wasn't condos back then.

535
00:32:37,953 --> 00:32:40,765
This has to be the right place.

536
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:47,735
So what am I missing?

537
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:20,640
Sorry about that.

538
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,460
Go back to sleep.

539
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:30,168
Hello.

540
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:33,904
Woman: Mr. Morgan? Dispatch.You've been called to the mccaffrey pumpkin patch.

541
00:33:33,991 --> 00:33:35,485
Do you need the address?

542
00:33:36,254 --> 00:33:39,415
No, I know exactly where it is.

543
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:45,089
-- Are you okay?
-- Are you kidding? That was awesome.

544
00:33:46,078 --> 00:33:48,489
You've got some hay in your hair.

545
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:49,590
Where?

546
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:51,161
Right there!

547
00:33:51,788 --> 00:33:53,257
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

548
00:33:53,258 --> 00:33:55,545
Enough. Enough, you two.Come on.

549
00:33:55,546 --> 00:33:58,278
Let me take a picture of you and the kids.

550
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:01,056
You'll miss these moments when they're older.

551
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:02,522
Thanks.

552
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,827
It's great to see you having such a good time, dex.

553
00:34:05,828 --> 00:34:08,285
Are you kidding me? This hay's giving me a total allergy attack,

554
00:34:08,286 --> 00:34:10,781
and we're going around in circles on a pumpkin patch.
I don't get it.

555
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,196
Ready?

556
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,404
Smile!

557
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:19,627
What do we have?

558
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:22,696
Ankle to knee.He's moving up the leg.

559
00:34:26,372 --> 00:34:28,934
You think tucci's still alive?

560
00:34:29,294 --> 00:34:31,710
If he is, he won't be for long.

561
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:38,938
Unless you're toting a portable dvd player,

562
00:34:38,939 --> 00:34:41,652
you better be finished watching that security footage.

563
00:34:41,653 --> 00:34:45,088
I am on break.I'm on my own time.

564
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:47,938
So you are, but your shift starts in two hours.

565
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:50,592
So if I were you,I'd head back to the station

566
00:34:50,593 --> 00:34:53,276
Traffic at this hour's a bitch.

567
00:34:54,354 --> 00:34:56,462
Speaking of bitch...

568
00:34:57,472 --> 00:35:00,025
didn't dad bring us here once when we were kids?

569
00:35:00,026 --> 00:35:01,605
I don't remember.

570
00:35:01,657 --> 00:35:04,275
Hey, dexter, come here.Take a look at this.

571
00:35:04,284 --> 00:35:05,970
Excuse us.

572
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:08,768
She's right, you know, about the traffic.

573
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,424
It's interesting.There's no sign of infection where the foot was cut off,

574
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:20,872
like he gave tucci prophylactic antibiotics before amputating.

575
00:35:20,873 --> 00:35:23,833
At least he's looking after his patient.

576
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:26,981
Hey, check this out.

577
00:35:28,652 --> 00:35:31,757
Is this appropriate?

578
00:35:31,758 --> 00:35:36,433
It's our anniversary... and it's the big one.

579
00:35:36,618 --> 00:35:39,075
Nina deserves the best.

580
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:41,896
"Ox"?

581
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:46,260
No. Fuck!

582
00:35:46,447 --> 00:35:48,822
What's the matter with you? It's x's and o'S.

583
00:35:49,204 --> 00:35:50,144
Like tic-tac-toe?

584
00:35:50,145 --> 00:35:53,170
No, like hugs and kisses.

585
00:35:53,891 --> 00:35:57,972
Diamond-filled hugs and kisses in a white-gold setting.

586
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:03,573
Well, that's good, 'cause you wouldn't want it to look like someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head.

587
00:36:07,509 --> 00:36:09,440
God da it.

588
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:17,378
Where's mom?

589
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:20,155
She had to run a few errands before she takes you two trick-or-treating.

590
00:36:20,156 --> 00:36:22,754
But I'm too tired to go trick-or-treating.

591
00:36:23,073 --> 00:36:25,161
I heard you two were up a lot last night.

592
00:36:25,162 --> 00:36:27,275
It was that damn dog.

593
00:36:27,469 --> 00:36:30,305
Hey, code, grown-up language is for grown-ups.

594
00:36:30,306 --> 00:36:32,376
I don't think that dog will be bothering you anymore.

595
00:36:32,377 --> 00:36:33,928
How do you know?

596
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:35,660
My mystic powers told me.

597
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:38,751
Heard lindsay lohan say "damn."

598
00:36:38,752 --> 00:36:40,742
All right, tell you what --I'll make you a deal.

599
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:43,811
When you become a rock star, you can swear, too.

600
00:36:43,812 --> 00:36:46,812
Walter! Walter!

601
00:36:47,009 --> 00:36:50,089
You're right.He's gone.

602
00:36:51,346 --> 00:36:54,113
Where's my dog?!What did you do with it?!

603
00:37:12,353 --> 00:37:14,592
All right.Here he is.

604
00:37:14,593 --> 00:37:19,687
Just remember to walk him, feed him, and love him, okay?

605
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:24,744
My nieces are shy sometimes.Girls, say thank you to rita.

606
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:26,519
Thank you.Thank you.

607
00:37:27,415 --> 00:37:30,462
They already made a doggy bed --sweaters, towels.

608
00:37:30,463 --> 00:37:33,452
It actually looks more comfortable than my bed.

609
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:36,351
I knew this would be a perfect fit.

610
00:37:36,352 --> 00:37:39,484
You did a good thing, rita.Thank you.

611
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:46,859
Harry was the only one who saw me --

612
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,024
really saw me --

613
00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:51,496
so he taught me to hide.

614
00:37:51,497 --> 00:37:54,055
That's what's kept me safe.

615
00:37:54,987 --> 00:38:00,970
But sometimes, I'm not sure where harry's vision of me ends and the real me starts.

616
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:05,196
If I'm just a collection of learned behaviors --bits and pieces of harry --

617
00:38:05,197 --> 00:38:07,069
maybe my new friend is right.

618
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,095
Maybe I am a fraud.

619
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:26,435
Hi.

620
00:38:26,436 --> 00:38:27,746
Hey.

621
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:33,707
Where's astor and cody?

622
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:38,064
They're passed out in a sugar coma at colleen'S.

623
00:38:41,342 --> 00:38:42,947
Um, can I come in?

624
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:46,860
Oh, yeah, sure.Sorry.

625
00:38:53,216 --> 00:38:56,721
I should warn you, I haven't really been myself lately.

626
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:00,561
maybe I can cheer you up.

627
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:09,137
Trick or treat.

628
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:15,914
You look great.

629
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:22,460
Who are you?

630
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:24,429
Lara croft.

631
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:26,509
"Tomb raider."

632
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,227
Oh.

633
00:39:29,037 --> 00:39:31,799
You raid tombs dssed like that?

634
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:33,518
That's impressive.

635
00:39:34,837 --> 00:39:35,977
What happened to snow white?

636
00:39:35,978 --> 00:39:39,870
Well, I'm --I'm sick of her.

637
00:39:42,406 --> 00:39:43,908
You know, I never did

638
00:39:43,909 --> 00:39:47,726
get to thank you for picking the kids up for me.

639
00:39:48,529 --> 00:39:50,344
Uh, you took care of your "errand"?

640
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:51,519
Yes.

641
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,045
The beagle has landed happily in the arms of two loving girls.

642
00:39:55,946 --> 00:39:57,318
You are a superhero.

643
00:40:03,888 --> 00:40:08,665
It was such an incredible feeling rescuing that dog.

644
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,617
You upset your neighbor.

645
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:14,669
Fuck her.

646
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:21,886
Well, I guess you're used to dealing with people like her, right?

647
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:24,360
Considerably worse.

648
00:40:24,361 --> 00:40:27,993
Is that why you haven't been yourself lately?

649
00:40:28,438 --> 00:40:31,983
There's a case I just can't seem to get out of my mind.

650
00:40:34,821 --> 00:40:37,748
maybe I can help.

651
00:40:38,393 --> 00:40:41,723
No. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.

652
00:40:41,724 --> 00:40:44,497
Oh, I don't know.

653
00:40:44,768 --> 00:40:48,188
I'm a dognapper now... and a tomb raider.

654
00:40:48,189 --> 00:40:52,930
There's all sorts of things I can do.

655
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:06,873
What --what are you doing?

656
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:09,303
Whatever I want.

657
00:41:12,752 --> 00:41:15,895
I've come to appreciate the comfortable moments with rita --

658
00:41:15,896 --> 00:41:19,422
the easy, quiet moments--

659
00:41:21,132 --> 00:41:23,605
This...

660
00:41:24,008 --> 00:41:26,366
might be better.

661
00:41:28,999 --> 00:41:34,566
Look, there's mr. Tub-of-lardi bringing mrs. Tub-of-lardi another bucket of fried chicken.

662
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:42,447
Where's your brother?

663
00:41:42,448 --> 00:41:44,320
I'm not his keeper.

664
00:41:46,815 --> 00:41:49,146
W-what do you think of this?

665
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,994
It's an anniversary present for nina.

666
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:58,111
See, it's -- it's a diamond key to my heart.

667
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:02,389
It's -- it's a key, but, you s, it's shaped like a heart.

668
00:42:02,718 --> 00:42:05,674
You can't tell me that it looks like anything else,'cause that's what it is.

669
00:42:05,675 --> 00:42:07,946
That's it.That's what I like.

670
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,127
And I'm not gonna take it back.

671
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:12,327
It's perfect, angel.

672
00:42:12,328 --> 00:42:13,883
She'll love it.

673
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:16,301
Really?

674
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,519
I would.

675
00:42:23,614 --> 00:42:25,153
How -- how do I look?

676
00:42:25,154 --> 00:42:26,572
Like the tie?

677
00:42:36,195 --> 00:42:38,043
Angel.

678
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,735
Happy anniversary, baby.

679
00:42:41,736 --> 00:42:45,324
You know you can't just walk in here anymore.

680
00:42:50,657 --> 00:42:53,300
I just thought...

681
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:56,953
our anniversary...

682
00:42:58,737 --> 00:43:02,634
maybe tonight we could put all that behind us.

683
00:43:02,993 --> 00:43:05,790
It doesn't matter what night it is.

684
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,781
I told you I need time.

685
00:43:07,787 --> 00:43:10,793
It's been three months, baby.

686
00:43:11,526 --> 00:43:13,596
How much time do you need?

687
00:43:13,597 --> 00:43:16,099
Don't turn this around on me, angel --

688
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,433
not after what you did.

689
00:43:19,917 --> 00:43:23,199
I need as much time as I need.

690
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:33,449
Angel...

691
00:43:37,328 --> 00:43:41,890
as long as you're here, you want to see aury?

692
00:43:55,456 --> 00:43:58,470
Lo siento, princesa.

693
00:43:59,485 --> 00:44:02,986
Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento.

694
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,519
Thank you.

695
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:51,782
That was...

696
00:44:55,523 --> 00:44:57,799
...unexpected.

697
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,783
Yeah. For me, too.

698
00:45:04,641 --> 00:45:07,446
I have no problem with...

699
00:45:07,755 --> 00:45:09,851
unexpected.

700
00:45:10,848 --> 00:45:14,649
No, you... certainly don'T.

701
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:25,233
I have to get back to the kids.

702
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,985
what are these?

703
00:45:33,276 --> 00:45:37,587
I've been, uh, reorganizing my photos a little.

704
00:45:37,924 --> 00:45:39,877
Oh.

705
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:42,474
Look how cute you are.

706
00:45:42,475 --> 00:45:47,520
And your dad --such a nice face, just like you.

707
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:49,990
I was adopted.

708
00:45:49,991 --> 00:45:51,895
I know.

709
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:54,199
But you're both good men.

710
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,950
I can tell.

711
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:02,820
Very poetic.

712
00:46:02,821 --> 00:46:06,168
Poetic? It's a water fountain.

713
00:46:06,398 --> 00:46:10,099
Well, yeah, but look at the way your dad took the photo.

714
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,760
His shadow's on the wall right next to you.

715
00:46:13,015 --> 00:46:15,440
It's like he's always with you.

716
00:46:15,726 --> 00:46:17,758
I'd frame this one.

717
00:46:19,064 --> 00:46:21,558
All this time the answer was right here.

718
00:46:21,697 --> 00:46:24,966
Harry -- photographer and foster father extraordinaire.

719
00:46:24,967 --> 00:46:27,519
He is always with me,

720
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,443
and he's the common denominator.

721
00:46:29,444 --> 00:46:31,989
Rita...

722
00:46:32,475 --> 00:46:34,362
you're a genius.

723
00:46:36,764 --> 00:46:38,973
All those years of smiling for the camera --

724
00:46:38,974 --> 00:46:40,562
it was empty and fake,

725
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:45,443
the pictures meaningless, until now.

726
00:46:45,444 --> 00:46:47,842
Pictures of harry.

727
00:47:02,846 --> 00:47:06,765
So this is it.

728
00:47:06,915 --> 00:47:08,678
It's cool.

729
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:11,037
Cool.

730
00:47:11,687 --> 00:47:14,851
Dexter, this is the place where my father,

731
00:47:14,852 --> 00:47:18,475
your grandfather, worked for 30 years.

732
00:47:18,476 --> 00:47:20,551
He started out as the janitor,

733
00:47:20,552 --> 00:47:22,954
worked his way up to chief of maintenance.

734
00:47:22,955 --> 00:47:25,637
This place put food on our table.

735
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:27,402
In two weeks, it'll all be shut down.

736
00:47:27,403 --> 00:47:28,838
I know.

737
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:32,120
Excuse me, miss! Miss?

738
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:33,617
-- Would you mind?
-- Oh, come on, dad.

739
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:35,474
I don't want to...

740
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,649
hey, you all right?

741
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:44,574
It's nothing. Bad medianoches for lunch. I'm okay.

742
00:47:44,575 --> 00:47:47,103
I'm sorry, miss.It's okay. Thanks.

743
00:47:47,104 --> 00:47:48,309
We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.

744
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,520
Yeah, we are.

745
00:47:49,521 --> 00:47:51,129
Dex, I really don't feel like doing this now.

746
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:52,418
Don't be a baby --

747
00:47:52,419 --> 00:47:56,447
being part of a family means smiling for family photos, right?

748
00:48:07,691 --> 00:48:09,573
My friend left this.

749
00:48:09,574 --> 00:48:12,152
He's showing me where to go.

750
00:48:13,238 --> 00:48:15,578
But I wonder... am I going because it's what he wants

751
00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:18,828
or because that's what harry would want?

752
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,859
What do i want?

753
00:48:50,713 --> 00:48:52,744
The hospital's shut down now,

754
00:48:52,745 --> 00:48:54,292
abandoned for years,

755
00:48:54,293 --> 00:48:58,311
but tonight it's visiting hours again.

756
00:49:28,998 --> 00:49:30,990
Well, james...

757
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:36,644
why did you have to be such a pain in the ass, huh?

758
00:49:41,877 --> 00:49:43,069
Ugh! Fuck.

759
00:49:43,325 --> 00:49:46,176
I didn't tell you you could get up.

760
00:50:03,258 --> 00:50:07,158
Please, please

761
00:50:09,608 --> 00:50:11,673
Now you get up.

762
00:50:18,914 --> 00:50:22,857
You traumatize my little girl in church...

763
00:50:24,037 --> 00:50:27,250
break the knees of my best turner.

764
00:50:29,115 --> 00:50:32,179
You're a wild dog, sergeant.

765
00:50:33,919 --> 00:50:36,340
The only thing to do with a wild dog --

766
00:50:37,341 --> 00:50:40,249
police! Hands in the air!

767
00:50:45,678 --> 00:50:47,586
Thought you could use backup.

768
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:50,692
You could have filled me in, man. Shit.

769
00:50:51,997 --> 00:50:55,719
Got you going after a goddamn cop, motherfucker.

770
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,517
We own your ass now.

771
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:05,286
So this was the plan all along --to use me as bait to bring down guerrero?

772
00:51:06,151 --> 00:51:09,877
Yeah, and now my sister can rest in peace.

773
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,373
We're done now, doakes.We're even.

774
00:51:12,776 --> 00:51:15,049
I'll call this in, bring the paramedics.

775
00:51:15,983 --> 00:51:18,573
Get this piece of shit out of here.

776
00:51:55,459 --> 00:51:57,560
Please.

777
00:52:01,154 --> 00:52:03,177
Just do it.

778
00:52:05,353 --> 00:52:07,735
Kill me.

779
00:52:08,924 --> 00:52:11,692
I'm ready.

780
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:25,138
Just don't cut me anymore.

781
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:30,403
Please don't cut me anymore.

782
00:52:30,693 --> 00:52:34,456
Gift-wrapped, begging for death.Tools at the ready.

783
00:52:34,457 --> 00:52:35,872
Just kill me.It's okay.

784
00:52:35,873 --> 00:52:39,110
He was left here so I would kill him,

785
00:52:39,111 --> 00:52:43,523
but my new friend doesn't see me as clearly as he thinks.

786
00:52:43,524 --> 00:52:45,646
I can't kill this man.

787
00:52:45,647 --> 00:52:48,497
Harry wouldn't want it.

788
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,120
And neither would I.

789
00:53:11,206 --> 00:53:12,670
Are you moan?

790
00:53:12,671 --> 00:53:15,873
Message came through dispatch for you.

791
00:53:20,461 --> 00:53:22,957
Who left this?

792
00:53:23,722 --> 00:53:25,965
Who left it?!

793
00:53:35,961 --> 00:53:38,065
jesus, stop that.I'm getting bruises.

794
00:53:38,066 --> 00:53:40,005
I'm sorry.I'm so excited.

795
00:53:40,006 --> 00:53:42,326
Try a hug once in a while.

796
00:53:44,865 --> 00:53:47,007
I don't know who your contacts are, morgan,

797
00:53:47,008 --> 00:53:48,510
but you are my up-and-comer.

798
00:53:48,511 --> 00:53:51,050
You saved a man's life tonight.

799
00:53:51,051 --> 00:53:52,651
I'm just the one who got the call, sir.

800
00:53:52,652 --> 00:53:54,708
But you followed it up.

801
00:53:55,213 --> 00:53:57,192
Right place at the right time, sir.

802
00:53:57,193 --> 00:53:58,405
Where we at?

803
00:53:58,512 --> 00:54:01,933
Morgan's tip was good.They're taking tucci over to county.

804
00:54:01,934 --> 00:54:03,607
Alive?

805
00:54:03,608 --> 00:54:05,365
Alive.

806
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:15,259
So, I suppose this gets deb off of surveillance-tape duty.

807
00:54:15,641 --> 00:54:17,082
Really?

808
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:18,098
Is that what you suppose?

809
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:20,029
I got your page, lieutenant.

810
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:22,271
Doakes is caught up in the guerrero bust.

811
00:54:22,272 --> 00:54:23,354
You're taking point here.

812
00:54:23,355 --> 00:54:25,721
-- You got it.
-- I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow.

813
00:54:25,722 --> 00:54:29,141
I want forensic evidence if you have to tear apart this building brick by brick.

814
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:31,651
-- Entiende?
-- s?

815
00:54:32,652 --> 00:54:34,909
Use morgan here.

816
00:54:40,095 --> 00:54:41,630
How did your wife like that necklace, angel?

817
00:54:41,631 --> 00:54:43,366
Oh, you were right.She loved it.

818
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:45,463
You nailed that one.

819
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:14,808
Everyone hides who they are... at lea some of the time.

820
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:22,775
Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply that you have to be reminded

821
00:55:22,776 --> 00:55:25,342
it's there at all.

822
00:55:35,053 --> 00:55:37,945
Good work, man.I told you we'd get that piss-poor...

823
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:46,186
and sometimes you just want to forget who you are altogether.

824
00:55:58,642 --> 00:56:01,163
And what about me?

825
00:56:01,164 --> 00:56:05,649
Maybe I'll never be the human harry wanted me to be.

826
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:08,881
But I couldn't kill tony tucci.

827
00:56:08,882 --> 00:56:11,304
That's not me, either.

828
00:56:12,053 --> 00:56:16,765
My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the kill he left for me,

829
00:56:16,766 --> 00:56:18,702
but I did.

830
00:56:27,314 --> 00:56:31,147
I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

831
00:56:31,148 --> 00:56:34,716
So I'm neither man nor beast.

832
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:37,463
I'm something new entirely,

833
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:40,190
with my own set of rules.

834
00:56:48,334 --> 00:56:51,199
I'm dexter.
