1
00:01:47,963 --> 00:01:49,840
Previously on "Dexter"...

2
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:52,651
You still don't remember
anything from before?

3
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:55,368
You know, before we took you in?
- No.

4
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,500
What are you doing?

5
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,000
I'd like to talk you through
a deep relaxation technique.

6
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:02,134
It might bring some
things to the surface.

7
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:05,767
Mama!

8
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,000
It was a match.

9
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:11,000
Joe Driscoll was your bio-dad.

10
00:02:12,073 --> 00:02:14,377
And this is Rudy.

11
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:16,015
- Dexter.
- Hey.

12
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:20,006
I have waited a long
time to meet you.

13
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:22,691
Why the different
nail polishes?

14
00:02:22,747 --> 00:02:24,252
What the hell's
this guy thinking?

15
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:26,231
And the real king
is still out there.

16
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:28,563
<i>Hungry.
Ready.</i>

17
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:31,152
<i>He'll kill again.</i>

18
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:32,872
<i>It's just a matter of time.</i>

19
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,501
Dex, Rudy's different.

20
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,353
I feel safe with him.
I think --

21
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:38,693
I'm falling for him.

22
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:40,803
Divorce papers.
Sign them now,

23
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:43,100
and I'll agree to supervised
visits twice a week.

24
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:44,931
You think you can really
make me back down?

25
00:02:45,355 --> 00:02:47,202
Are you fucking my wife?

26
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:51,202
The kids are already
settled at Colleen's.

27
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,203
You can have your
visit when we get back.

28
00:02:55,688 --> 00:02:57,401
I just wish he'd go away.

29
00:02:57,538 --> 00:03:00,320
I mean, why can't he just go
away and disappear forever?

30
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:02,153
No!

31
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:03,910
Fucking whore!

32
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,042
Come on, buckaroos.
It's Monday.

33
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:26,422
Can't be late Monday.
Throws the whole week off.

34
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,251
What about breakfast?

35
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,761
Made and eaten.

36
00:03:29,798 --> 00:03:32,152
- And the kids' lunches?
- Packed and ready to go.

37
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:33,922
Did you tell the locksmith?

38
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,521
Yeah, new locks
on every door,

39
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:37,313
reinforced strike plates,

40
00:03:37,336 --> 00:03:39,090
seven-pin keyways.

41
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:41,053
Here you go, buddy.

42
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,600
Why don't you kids
go wait in my car?

43
00:03:42,635 --> 00:03:44,300
I want to talk to
your mom for a sec.

44
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:46,111
Are you gonna make out?

45
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:47,621
None of your business.

46
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:49,220
- Are you?
- Astor.

47
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:55,201
Rita, you don't have
to do this, you know.

48
00:03:55,255 --> 00:03:57,620
Getting attacked by your
ex-husband merits a day off.

49
00:03:57,668 --> 00:03:58,552
I'm fine.

50
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,431
I'm not gonna let Paul
control my life anymore.

51
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:01,553
Those days are over.

52
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:04,031
It's gonna be okay.
The police have been notified.

53
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:05,470
They'll find him.

54
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:07,071
What if they don't?

55
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:10,602
I got you some
pepper spray.

56
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:13,701
Just aim for the eyes.

57
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:27,603
Hey, you want some?
It's Kirk Bliloc's cake.

58
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,402
I had some at
Kirk's birthday,

59
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:30,983
10 days ago.

60
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,793
See, you have lunch every
day with your boyfriend,

61
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:34,603
you miss a thing or
two around here.

62
00:04:34,657 --> 00:04:37,031
Cake's still good.
It's mocha, I think.

63
00:04:37,587 --> 00:04:39,123
It started out vanilla.

64
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:43,651
Guys, you should look at this.

65
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:46,981
Put that thing down,
for God's sake.

66
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:48,402
It was addressed to Homicide.

67
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:49,552
Put it down!

68
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:51,702
Jesus, is that blood?

69
00:04:51,737 --> 00:04:53,350
Morgan, get your
ass over here.

70
00:04:53,645 --> 00:04:55,090
Ass en route.

71
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:56,992
You're the blood expert.
What is this shit?

72
00:04:57,986 --> 00:04:59,712
It's a little watery for jam.

73
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:01,832
Maybe you should open it.

74
00:05:03,898 --> 00:05:06,902
What if there's an airborne toxin
in here waiting to be released?

75
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:09,380
I got to wash my hands.

76
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:11,761
So gullible.

77
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:18,902
What is it?

78
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:20,800
Well, it's definitely blood.

79
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:23,800
Wait, there's
something in here.

80
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:36,270
Marina View hotel.

81
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:38,203
It's a key.

82
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:40,623
May be some sort of
promotional gag.

83
00:05:40,665 --> 00:05:42,700
You know, stay the weekend,
you get a jar of blood.

84
00:05:43,825 --> 00:05:45,502
Show-and-tell's over.

85
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:47,381
Let's try and find
out who sent this.

86
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:49,253
Grab Batista and get
over to that hotel.

87
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,172
Batista's still working on the
explosion at the smack lab.

88
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,042
Morgan, put the cake down.
You're with me.

89
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:56,101
<i>A jar of blood --</i>

90
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:59,093
<i>Dramatic, cryptic, playful.</i>

91
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:01,123
<i>Could it be him?</i>

92
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:13,412
Got an extra key
from the manager.

93
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:15,531
Said the same thing as
the front-desk clerk.

94
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:18,200
The guy who checked into 103
was white and normal looking.

95
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:20,550
I haven't seen a single security
camera since we've been here.

96
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:22,221
It's likely this
guy scouted hotels

97
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:23,750
and chose one
with lax security.

98
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:25,400
Better be ready to
cancel your lunch.

99
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:28,891
Police. Open up.

100
00:06:37,726 --> 00:06:40,752
Oh, my God. Jesus.
Get back in your room.

101
00:06:42,297 --> 00:06:45,722
Metro dispatch, this is 3-Henry-8-8
out at the Marina View hotel.

102
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:48,222
I need uniformed
backup, forensics.

103
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,862
Fuck it.
Just send everybody out.

104
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:03,310
It's been a while since
we went prophylactic.

105
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:05,152
Not me.
Last night, I met this chick --

106
00:07:05,185 --> 00:07:06,802
I'll stop you
right there, Vince.

107
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:09,632
So, they tell you anything
about what's inside?

108
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:11,652
No one's been inside.
Too much blood.

109
00:07:11,705 --> 00:07:13,043
Dexter.

110
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,500
Just a heads-up --
It's bad in there.

111
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:16,503
Okay.

112
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:18,372
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

113
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:20,851
She's not kidding.
It's your wet dream in there.

114
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:22,060
Okay.

115
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:24,243
You're going in first alone.

116
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,070
Get a sense of what
we're dealing with

117
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:28,972
and give me a report.
Don't fuck up.

118
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:48,291
<i>Now I'm really curious.</i>

119
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,652
<i>He's been
gone so long,</i>

120
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:51,803
<i>he had to be planning
a splashy return,</i>

121
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:54,261
<i>but a crime scene just for me?</i>

122
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:10,842
Mommy!

123
00:08:29,456 --> 00:08:31,111
Tell me you found
something, Morgan.

124
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:32,792
I talked to the
guests in room 105.

125
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:34,301
They didn't see
anyone go in or out.

126
00:08:34,335 --> 00:08:35,423
What about across the hall?

127
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:37,380
German tourists.
They got their head up their lederhosen.

128
00:08:37,505 --> 00:08:38,803
They said they heard
a whirring sound

129
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:40,331
but thought someone
was mixing margaritas

130
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:41,302
or vacuuming.

131
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:46,272
Oh, my god!

132
00:08:47,196 --> 00:08:49,413
Hey.
Hey, you okay?

133
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,170
I'm just a little queasy.
I fell down in there.

134
00:08:57,207 --> 00:08:58,720
Never should have
skipped breakfast.

135
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:01,002
Bullshit. You're shaking.
What the hell happened up there?

136
00:09:01,158 --> 00:09:02,881
No, I'm okay.
I just need a little air.

137
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:04,372
Something finally got to you.

138
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:06,031
I guess you're
human after all.

139
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:07,602
Cut him some slack, all right?

140
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:09,400
I hate to disappoint you,

141
00:09:09,438 --> 00:09:11,201
I think it's just low blood sugar.

142
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:12,770
Tell us what you saw, Dex.

143
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,207
How many dead?

144
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:15,485
A lot.

145
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:17,786
But no bodies,
just blood --

146
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,503
50, 60 liters.

147
00:09:20,538 --> 00:09:23,493
Maybe half a dozen dead.
I don't know.

148
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:25,600
You're saying there was
a mass murder in there,

149
00:09:25,637 --> 00:09:27,251
- but they took the bodies?
- How is that possible?

150
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:29,721
There's one elevator,
emergency stairs with alarms.

151
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:31,981
Someone would have seen
corpses coming out.

152
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,303
I don't fucking know.

153
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,633
Hey, Dexter,
you all right?

154
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,652
- I can't go back in there.
- You don't have to.

155
00:09:40,257 --> 00:09:41,103
Fine.

156
00:09:41,238 --> 00:09:43,271
Just get yourself
cleaned up and --

157
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:45,883
I don't know --
Work from the hallway or something.

158
00:09:56,407 --> 00:09:57,903
You're in room 422.

159
00:09:57,936 --> 00:09:59,420
Elevators are
to your right,

160
00:09:59,455 --> 00:10:01,001
and Bobby will
see to your bags.

161
00:10:03,856 --> 00:10:05,401
Dade county
sheriff's department.

162
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,931
I'm looking for
Rita Bennett.

163
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:10,280
That's me.
Did you find Paul?

164
00:10:10,706 --> 00:10:13,200
- I'm sorry?
- Paul Bennett.

165
00:10:16,338 --> 00:10:19,151
My ex-husband attacked
me last night.

166
00:10:19,196 --> 00:10:20,611
My boyfriend filed
a police report.

167
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:22,883
The only report we have is the
one that Mr. Bennett filed.

168
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:24,771
What?
Wait.

169
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:28,402
Paul filed a police report?
For what?

170
00:10:28,507 --> 00:10:30,953
Assault. Your ex-husband
was just released

171
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:32,750
from Baptist
Memorial hospital.

172
00:10:32,858 --> 00:10:34,582
He's pressing
charges against you.

173
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:36,403
He attacked me!

174
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,702
Not according to him.

175
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:41,743
All right. Can we talk
about this later?

176
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:43,301
We need a formal statement.

177
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:45,950
You're gonna have to come with
us right now to the station.

178
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:47,700
Fine.

179
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,940
Hey, make sure you label
the section of the grid

180
00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:53,701
each blood sample
came from. All right?

181
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:55,451
Sweet.

182
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:58,541
You should really
get in here, Dex.

183
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:00,792
I never seen
anything like this.

184
00:11:01,018 --> 00:11:03,741
Wait till you've seen a few
more Columbian drug busts.

185
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:06,790
Dude, I got misting
up the walls,

186
00:11:07,897 --> 00:11:10,213
across the ceiling,

187
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,471
but no tissue.
Come see.

188
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,901
Photos, Vince.

189
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:18,362
Hey, and how come the
blood's not clotting?

190
00:11:18,608 --> 00:11:20,502
The blood's not clotting?

191
00:11:21,206 --> 00:11:22,472
No.

192
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,902
Genuine medical mystery.

193
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:28,602
Just keep getting samples.

194
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:30,801
I'll test it at the lab.

195
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:46,622
Hello?
Don't hang up.

196
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,663
Dexter, I'm at the
sheriff's station.

197
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:50,731
Paul's pressing assault
charges against me.

198
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,223
How's it even possible?
I was defending myself.

199
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:56,103
Just stay calm.
I know a lawyer.

200
00:11:56,137 --> 00:11:57,742
I'll straighten it out.

201
00:11:57,907 --> 00:11:59,102
I am calm.

202
00:11:59,148 --> 00:12:00,702
They're the hysterical ones.

203
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:03,883
They're charging me
with a class-2 felony.

204
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:08,530
Hello, Dexter?
Are you there?

205
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:09,973
Yeah, I'm right here.

206
00:12:10,115 --> 00:12:11,761
This is ridiculous.

207
00:12:12,008 --> 00:12:14,451
I could lose my job.
I could lose my kids.

208
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,452
I won't let that happen.

209
00:12:16,455 --> 00:12:17,961
Well, I'm glad
you're so confident.

210
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:19,421
Rita, just trust me.

211
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:20,831
I know how the
system works.

212
00:12:20,878 --> 00:12:23,111
Look, I'm at a crime scene right now,
and I have to go,

213
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:25,203
but I'll talk to my
lawyer friend right away.

214
00:12:26,257 --> 00:12:27,851
- You okay?
- Yeah.

215
00:12:28,408 --> 00:12:30,980
Yeah, I'm okay.

216
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:33,652
- Thank you.
- Yeah, bye.

217
00:12:40,535 --> 00:12:43,111
Is there a wall socket in there?
Check it out.

218
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:45,232
- What? A wall socket?
- Yeah.

219
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,713
Of course there's a wall socket.
There's lots of wall --

220
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:50,800
Hey, you're right.

221
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:54,113
There was something
plugged in here --

222
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:56,370
probably a power
tool to cut them up.

223
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:58,251
Come take a look.

224
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:00,352
Photos, Vince.

225
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:02,800
Lots and lots of photos.

226
00:13:05,357 --> 00:13:06,953
Open Sesame.

227
00:13:07,107 --> 00:13:08,703
Blood samples for the fridge.

228
00:13:08,736 --> 00:13:10,853
And you better make room.
There's a lot more coming.

229
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:15,003
Shooters at the Bel Canto
tonight. You in?

230
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:16,250
I'm not in the mood.

231
00:13:16,305 --> 00:13:18,503
Angel,
you're on the market,

232
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:20,522
and the Bel Canto
is hottie central.

233
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,453
Look at this.

234
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:25,411
They were for
Nina's birthday --

235
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:27,610
backstage passes
to Neil Diamond.

236
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:29,510
You're in worse
shape than I thought.

237
00:13:41,706 --> 00:13:43,301
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

238
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:46,581
Oh, Masuka was looking for you.

239
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:48,600
Something about drinks
at the Bel Canto.

240
00:13:48,648 --> 00:13:50,653
Yeah, I told him I
had a yeast infection.

241
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:53,603
A bit of an overshare.

242
00:14:00,905 --> 00:14:02,952
You want to talk about
what happened today?

243
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:05,202
Already did.

244
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:07,951
Dexter, the last time
I saw you like that

245
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:09,500
was when dad died.

246
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:12,513
Can talk to me, you know?

247
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:15,040
Just got to open your
mouth and move it.

248
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:17,073
I'll call Rudy.
I'll tell him I'll be late.

249
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,640
Deb, seriously.

250
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:20,621
I puked.

251
00:14:20,646 --> 00:14:21,800
I'm fine.

252
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,161
I know you want to help,

253
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:25,232
but unless you have breath mints,
there's nothing to do.

254
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:26,582
Why do you always do this?

255
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:29,042
- Do what?
- You shut me out!

256
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:30,701
Like your birth father
that lived up the highway

257
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:32,403
your whole life and never
tried to contact you.

258
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:34,052
I still don't know how
that makes you feel.

259
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:41,100
I'll tell you what,
if some random emotion strikes me

260
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:43,402
in the middle of the night,
you'll be the first one I call.

261
00:14:44,856 --> 00:14:46,100
Fine.

262
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,522
Whatever.

263
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,333
Did Paul force his
way into the house?

264
00:14:51,405 --> 00:14:52,400
N o.

265
00:14:52,537 --> 00:14:54,463
Did you ask him to leave?

266
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:56,361
Yes, and he refused.

267
00:14:56,538 --> 00:14:59,251
But in your statement,
it says

268
00:14:59,508 --> 00:15:03,102
you invited your ex-husband
into your bedroom.

269
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:07,082
He was drunk,
and the kids were asleep,

270
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:09,232
and I knew exactly where
this was heading --

271
00:15:09,265 --> 00:15:11,281
Cracked ribs and a broken jaw.

272
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:14,191
And you didn't want it to escalate.
I understand that,

273
00:15:14,228 --> 00:15:16,050
but we can't prove intent.

274
00:15:16,237 --> 00:15:18,633
Your ex-husband has
the injuries here, not you.

275
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:20,693
Paul has a record
of spousal abuse.

276
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,750
Spousal abuse can be mutual.

277
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:24,700
It was never mutual.

278
00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:27,133
Okay.

279
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:30,602
But the man is
a model parolee.

280
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:32,100
His drug tests are clean.

281
00:15:32,135 --> 00:15:34,541
He's got glowing reports from
the court-appointed supervisor.

282
00:15:34,607 --> 00:15:37,202
Corrections will want to
see this guy transition.

283
00:15:37,246 --> 00:15:38,302
I don't care!

284
00:15:38,357 --> 00:15:40,903
He's not going near my
children. Do you understand?

285
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:43,803
Rita,

286
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:46,252
if you deny him visitation,

287
00:15:46,306 --> 00:15:48,001
you could lose your children.

288
00:15:48,218 --> 00:15:50,750
Now, you have
deposition in two days.

289
00:15:50,787 --> 00:15:54,132
Do not give this man any more
ammunition than he already has.

290
00:15:57,506 --> 00:15:58,962
Okay.

291
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:03,351
Damn.

292
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:05,502
Just blood?

293
00:16:05,545 --> 00:16:07,001
What happened to the bodies?

294
00:16:07,107 --> 00:16:08,360
Hell if I know.

295
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:10,392
I don't want to know.

296
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,303
Blood was bad enough.

297
00:16:13,328 --> 00:16:15,373
No wonder you
seem so amped.

298
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,202
Your brother must
have loved it.

299
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:19,471
- Fuck no. He freaked.
- Really?

300
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:22,603
I thought, you know,
blood was his thing.

301
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:23,942
What happened?

302
00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:26,523
I don' know. It was like usual.
He shut me out.

303
00:16:27,257 --> 00:16:30,300
- Did he say anything?
- Let's not talk about Dex right now.

304
00:16:35,396 --> 00:16:37,302
Was it like a panic attack?

305
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,702
I don't know.

306
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:41,650
He's not really big into
sharing his feelings,

307
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:43,633
in case you hadn't noticed.

308
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,552
Kiss me.

309
00:16:54,307 --> 00:16:56,502
What's the matter?
You don't even have wood.

310
00:16:57,556 --> 00:16:59,913
Well, you're the one that
said you wanted to talk.

311
00:16:59,946 --> 00:17:02,383
Yeah, but not now.
I'm horny.

312
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,533
Maybe I should call him.

313
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:08,522
Are you fucking kidding me?

314
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:11,002
What? We --
We bonded last weekend.

315
00:17:11,086 --> 00:17:12,753
Isn't that what boyfriends
are supposed to do,

316
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:14,630
show some interest
in the family?

317
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:18,020
Yeah, but not when his girlfriend's
trying to get into his pants.

318
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:19,490
Deb, that's not fair.

319
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:20,770
You take me out on a --

320
00:17:20,808 --> 00:17:22,862
couples' weekend to get
to know your brother,

321
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:25,283
and then you punish
me for giving a damn?

322
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:28,603
I mean,
your issues don't have to be mine.

323
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,073
You know what?

324
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,242
Forget it.
Let's just go to sleep.

325
00:17:38,096 --> 00:17:41,151
Okay.
I'm gonna go watch TV.

326
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:52,741
She loved him
so goddamn much.

327
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:57,023
She took every one of his
CDs in the separation.

328
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:59,922
She wouldn't even give
me his Greatest Hits.

329
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:02,591
Nina loved Neil Diamond.

330
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:05,242
"Song Sung Blue."

331
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:07,910
"September Morn."

332
00:18:08,105 --> 00:18:09,920
Oh, my god --
"Kentucky Woman."

333
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:12,252
You got to
love that shit.

334
00:18:19,935 --> 00:18:22,932
That's like the fourth
chick you've driven off.

335
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,742
Waitress!
Is there a waitress?

336
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:26,630
I need a drink.
Waitress!

337
00:18:26,668 --> 00:18:28,310
Bro, you're a train wreck.

338
00:18:28,545 --> 00:18:30,903
Look, you got to stop
talking about the divorce.

339
00:18:30,937 --> 00:18:31,910
I ain't ashamed.

340
00:18:32,008 --> 00:18:35,013
Yeah, I think that's clear,
but it's pathetic.

341
00:18:35,706 --> 00:18:36,763
Look...

342
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:39,151
Don't talk about the
divorce unless they ask.

343
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:40,452
Comprendo?

344
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:44,050
- Eighty-six the ring.
- I have to take a squirt.

345
00:18:56,827 --> 00:18:59,261
She's gonna fuck me silly.

346
00:19:02,295 --> 00:19:05,482
<i>My sister's right.
I don't share my problems with her...</i>

347
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:07,552
<i>Or with anybody.</i>

348
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:10,740
<i>Harry taught me that --
Secrecy, self-reliance,</i>

349
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:13,603
<i>and a well-stocked
cupboard of hefty bags.</i>

350
00:19:14,606 --> 00:19:17,601
<i>Fortunately, I've never met
a problem I can't manage...</i>

351
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:21,602
<i>Until that boy in the blood.</i>

352
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,592
<i>He scares me.
I want him to go away.</i>

353
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:27,491
You awake?

354
00:19:29,438 --> 00:19:30,763
What?

355
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:35,082
Are you sure you
locked the door?

356
00:19:35,545 --> 00:19:38,691
Yeah, I'm positive --
Bolt and chain.

357
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:42,653
What am I gonna do?

358
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:46,653
Don't worry.
I'll figure it out.

359
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:52,373
<i>And I will.</i>

360
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:53,901
<i>I can always see
other people's problems</i>

361
00:19:53,945 --> 00:19:55,992
<i>more clearly than my own.</i>

362
00:19:56,157 --> 00:19:58,832
<i>Fortunately, Rita's has a name.</i>

363
00:20:00,496 --> 00:20:02,372
Everyone who set foot
on the bloody carpet

364
00:20:02,407 --> 00:20:04,301
in room 103
left a footprint,

365
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,202
and since we do shoe molds
of everyone on personnel,

366
00:20:07,258 --> 00:20:10,540
that leaves only one set of
footprints unaccounted for --

367
00:20:10,728 --> 00:20:12,083
The killer's.

368
00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:13,903
This shows everywhere
he went in the room.

369
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:15,891
- The question is why.
- Hold on.

370
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,561
Aren't we missing something?

371
00:20:17,908 --> 00:20:19,522
Where are the victims' footprints?

372
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:21,333
Give that lady a lollipop.

373
00:20:21,366 --> 00:20:24,201
Are you suggesting there were
never any bodies in room 103?

374
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,460
Why would a guy stage a massacre
and not have any bodies?

375
00:20:27,508 --> 00:20:28,701
And where'd he get the blood?

376
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:30,441
I've just got a
preliminary blood report.

377
00:20:30,755 --> 00:20:33,703
The blood in that room came from
at least 5 different bodies,

378
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:35,000
possibly more.

379
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:37,001
<i>My fellow traveler
had five victims.</i>

380
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:38,753
Ice-truck killer had 5 victims.

381
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:40,303
5 bloodless victims.

382
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,152
<i>I always wondered what
he did with the blood.</i>

383
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:42,903
Wait, wait.

384
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:44,903
The ice-truck killer did
not horde his victims' blood

385
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:47,102
just to have a party at the
motherfucking Marina View hotel.

386
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:48,101
Why would he do that?

387
00:20:48,136 --> 00:20:50,111
<i>To chase me down
the rabbit hole.</i>

388
00:20:50,177 --> 00:20:51,272
What was that, Morgan?

389
00:20:52,697 --> 00:20:54,452
I didn't say anything.

390
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:57,971
I'll remind you people --

391
00:20:58,005 --> 00:20:59,653
We arrested
the ice-truck killer.

392
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:02,100
His name is Neil Perry,
and he's awaiting trial in county.

393
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,240
Bullshit.

394
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,701
Neil Perry recanted his
confession. He's a fraud.

395
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:08,882
- Try telling that to the capital.
- I did.

396
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:10,800
Do we have any more evidence
to support this theory?

397
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:12,902
When Masuka noticed
the blood wasn't clotting,

398
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:13,981
I ran some tests,

399
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:16,303
and it was loaded with
Coumadin and heparin.

400
00:21:16,356 --> 00:21:18,803
One's an anticoagulant.
The other's a preservative.

401
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,102
It means the blood's old.

402
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:23,353
Plus the blood spatters'
all impact and castoff.

403
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:25,362
There are no hand transfers or

404
00:21:25,546 --> 00:21:28,281
swipe patterns to indicate the
presence of any actual victims.

405
00:21:28,318 --> 00:21:30,603
Masuka, run the DNA
on all five vics

406
00:21:30,638 --> 00:21:31,602
and see if it matches

407
00:21:31,637 --> 00:21:33,303
the ice-truck killer's victims.

408
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:35,001
You two get out to
the Marina View hotel.

409
00:21:35,035 --> 00:21:36,153
Retrace his steps.

410
00:21:36,206 --> 00:21:37,721
Maybe it'll tell
us something.

411
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,951
And not a word to anyone
about the ice-truck killer.

412
00:21:48,478 --> 00:21:50,901
All right, Astor,
just stand up straight.

413
00:21:51,525 --> 00:21:53,973
Now, do you have the
emergency phone number list?

414
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:57,361
It's in my backpack.
Do I have to show it to you again?

415
00:21:57,505 --> 00:22:00,500
Just promise me you won't let
your brother out of your sight.

416
00:22:00,545 --> 00:22:01,501
Rita?

417
00:22:06,146 --> 00:22:07,553
You're scaring them.

418
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:09,013
Yeah, well, they should be.

419
00:22:09,055 --> 00:22:11,503
I didn't tell them what
Paul did the other night.

420
00:22:12,118 --> 00:22:14,702
What'd you say when you
dragged them to the neighbors'?

421
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:16,103
I smelled gas.

422
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:18,370
I should have just
thrown them in the car

423
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:20,750
and headed out of state,
gone back to Michigan.

424
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:22,351
Remember what
the lawyer said.

425
00:22:22,385 --> 00:22:24,101
You don't want to
do anything rash.

426
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,940
Just relax. The court supervisor
will be there the whole time.

427
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:37,010
Hey, buddy. Come on.
Where's the love? Come on.

428
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:38,810
Daddy, what happened?

429
00:22:39,587 --> 00:22:42,212
Oh, nothing, buddy. Just a little
bump on the head. That's it.

430
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:43,800
Hey, we're going
to the circus.

431
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:47,102
We're going to the circus, 'cause daddy
always keeps his promises, remember?

432
00:22:47,706 --> 00:22:48,651
Good.

433
00:22:48,977 --> 00:22:50,502
All right. Ready?

434
00:22:51,088 --> 00:22:52,202
Got your stuff?

435
00:22:53,175 --> 00:22:54,533
Let's go.

436
00:22:56,337 --> 00:22:57,871
You okay?

437
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:09,360
<i>I prefer the enchanting
Rita over the worried one.</i>

438
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:12,981
<i>If I can figure out a way to
make her ex-husband my problem,</i>

439
00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:15,452
<i>I can help her sleep
much easier tonight.</i>

440
00:23:24,177 --> 00:23:27,303
<i>All I need is a little
proof of his inner monster.</i>

441
00:23:27,787 --> 00:23:29,901
<i>Harry would have
insisted on that.</i>

442
00:23:40,195 --> 00:23:42,350
<i>Harry didn't believe
in preemptive killing,</i>

443
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:44,803
<i>but maybe I can bend the
rules just this once.</i>

444
00:23:44,835 --> 00:23:46,501
<i>After all, Harry
wasn't perfect.</i>

445
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,352
<i>He lied about
my birth father.</i>

446
00:23:52,607 --> 00:23:56,203
<i>The trifecta --
Weapon, ammo, and impaired judgment.</i>

447
00:23:56,308 --> 00:23:57,803
<i>Throw in a little
domestic violence,</i>

448
00:23:57,845 --> 00:24:00,461
<i>and you have the perfect
recipe for a family slaughter.</i>

449
00:24:03,946 --> 00:24:06,000
<i>Mommy!</i>

450
00:24:09,237 --> 00:24:11,681
<i>Hide your head, Dexter.</i>

451
00:24:12,938 --> 00:24:14,783
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

452
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,260
<i>No!</i>

453
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:00,802
So, after he soaked
the room in blood,

454
00:25:00,806 --> 00:25:02,643
he crossed to the desk...

455
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:06,692
And then over to
the bedside table.

456
00:25:08,318 --> 00:25:11,790
There's a clock radio
and some smeared blood.

457
00:25:12,115 --> 00:25:13,932
Maybe he turned it on.

458
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:18,512
No, we're missing something.
Let's go over it again.

459
00:25:18,545 --> 00:25:20,001
We've been over it three times!

460
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:21,543
Well, maybe
the map's wrong.

461
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:23,000
Call your brother.

462
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:25,492
What?

463
00:25:25,527 --> 00:25:27,601
Why is everybody's first
move to call Dexter?

464
00:25:27,635 --> 00:25:28,500
You don't even like him.

465
00:25:28,536 --> 00:25:29,501
What'd the freak do this time,

466
00:25:29,535 --> 00:25:30,903
boil your goldfish?

467
00:25:32,178 --> 00:25:33,341
No, it's just...

468
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,303
It's Rudy.

469
00:25:36,355 --> 00:25:37,470
We had our first fight.

470
00:25:37,758 --> 00:25:40,000
Tiff. I don't know.
Whatever you want to call it.

471
00:25:40,047 --> 00:25:41,903
I thought we were talking
about your brother.

472
00:25:41,948 --> 00:25:43,152
We were.

473
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,602
And we'll be back with Billy Joel,
the Eurythmics,

474
00:25:45,658 --> 00:25:47,200
and Devo on 103 fm,

475
00:25:47,305 --> 00:25:49,693
- hits from the '80s.
- Turn that off.

476
00:25:49,696 --> 00:25:50,843
No, wait.
I want to hear it.

477
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,853
It's Devo.
Turn that shit off.

478
00:25:53,308 --> 00:25:55,801
He said 103 fm.
This is room 103.

479
00:25:58,077 --> 00:25:59,943
Leviticus 10:3.

480
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,041
- 10:3 -- 103.
- Son of a bitch.

481
00:26:03,106 --> 00:26:04,650
You think he's trying
to tell us something?

482
00:26:04,705 --> 00:26:06,890
"I will be sanctified in
them that come nigh me,

483
00:26:06,925 --> 00:26:08,552
"and before all people,

484
00:26:09,098 --> 00:26:10,742
"I will be glorified."

485
00:26:23,835 --> 00:26:24,973
Hey.

486
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:27,951
Hey.

487
00:26:28,388 --> 00:26:30,920
Deb's pissed at me.
I need advice.

488
00:26:31,405 --> 00:26:32,900
So you came here?

489
00:26:33,005 --> 00:26:35,303
You know you know her
better than anyone.

490
00:26:36,358 --> 00:26:38,720
Come on.
I got two porterhouses

491
00:26:38,768 --> 00:26:40,513
and a sixer of microbrew.

492
00:26:41,237 --> 00:26:43,582
Well, one minute we're
talking about her day,

493
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:46,150
you know,
the whole bloodbath thing.

494
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:47,221
Right.

495
00:26:47,408 --> 00:26:49,103
And the next,
she wants to...

496
00:26:49,305 --> 00:26:51,002
jump my bones.

497
00:26:51,206 --> 00:26:53,502
I mean, Deb's hot and all, but

498
00:26:53,556 --> 00:26:56,280
sprinkle in a little conversation
once in a while, you know?

499
00:26:56,316 --> 00:26:58,503
She's my sister.
I don't know.

500
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:01,500
Can I help you
find something?

501
00:27:01,545 --> 00:27:03,842
You wouldn't happen to
have a good meat knife.

502
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:09,701
Thanks.

503
00:27:11,336 --> 00:27:12,503
Anyway,

504
00:27:12,535 --> 00:27:14,312
the other half of the argument

505
00:27:14,525 --> 00:27:15,902
was about you.

506
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:18,222
Me?

507
00:27:18,238 --> 00:27:20,130
Yeah. It was already
tense enough, but

508
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,451
when I brought your name,
she lost it.

509
00:27:25,565 --> 00:27:28,180
So, what do I do?

510
00:27:28,428 --> 00:27:30,251
Tell her it's all your fault.

511
00:27:30,435 --> 00:27:32,590
- Seriously?
- You will eventually.

512
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:34,480
Deb has a way of
wearing you down.

513
00:27:34,507 --> 00:27:36,751
Just start from there.
It's easier.

514
00:27:44,306 --> 00:27:46,811
I got to take this.
You mind if I...?

515
00:27:50,748 --> 00:27:53,843
Hey. Where are you?

516
00:27:54,165 --> 00:27:56,043
Still at work, chasing a lead.

517
00:27:56,306 --> 00:27:57,353
Let me guess --

518
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:58,752
The bloodbath case.

519
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:00,703
I don't want to talk
shop right now.

520
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,002
Baby, I am so sorry.

521
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:04,402
You were totally right.

522
00:28:04,435 --> 00:28:06,601
I was mad at Dexter,
and I took it out on you.

523
00:28:06,638 --> 00:28:09,170
My shift's almost done.
You want to come over and talk?

524
00:28:09,205 --> 00:28:11,201
I'd love to, babe, but

525
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:13,702
I'm about to eat
dinner with Dexter.

526
00:28:19,736 --> 00:28:21,231
Well, after.

527
00:28:22,328 --> 00:28:24,432
Yeah, but here's the thing.

528
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:28,500
I think I'm gonna sleep
at my place tonight.

529
00:28:28,936 --> 00:28:31,500
I mean, it's closer, and

530
00:28:31,618 --> 00:28:33,412
I'm drinking,
you know.

531
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:36,251
You understand, right?

532
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,682
Yeah.

533
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:39,100
I'll call you tomorrow.

534
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,972
- Care to dance?
- You dance to this?

535
00:29:16,205 --> 00:29:17,371
A bit.

536
00:29:17,597 --> 00:29:19,610
What about your wife?

537
00:29:20,446 --> 00:29:22,831
Tan line on your ring finger.

538
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:24,080
Well, um...

539
00:29:25,758 --> 00:29:27,653
I'm not gonna talk
about that tonight.

540
00:29:27,828 --> 00:29:30,032
Divorced?
I get it.

541
00:29:30,918 --> 00:29:33,003
Mine was just finalized.

542
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:38,680
Let's go.

543
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:29,800
Will you excuse me?

544
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:31,253
Excuse me.

545
00:30:34,355 --> 00:30:36,362
Police.
I need to talk to you.

546
00:30:36,408 --> 00:30:38,302
I'm not a hooker anymore.

547
00:30:38,475 --> 00:30:40,603
I work for a legitimate
escort service now.

548
00:30:41,395 --> 00:30:42,940
I'm not here to bust anyone.

549
00:30:43,316 --> 00:30:46,612
I just need to know why you
paint your nails the way you do.

550
00:30:47,565 --> 00:30:49,063
He was a real good client.

551
00:30:49,095 --> 00:30:51,091
You want to spend
the night in a cell?

552
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,122
All right. About a year ago,
there was this guy.

553
00:30:54,265 --> 00:30:56,990
- Guy or client?
- A john, okay?

554
00:30:57,138 --> 00:30:59,172
That's when I
worked Calle Ocho.

555
00:30:59,405 --> 00:31:03,631
Anyway, he started getting all
rough with me until he saw this.

556
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:04,422
Then what?

557
00:31:04,547 --> 00:31:07,240
Then he changed his tune,
got all turned on.

558
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,980
Told me to take
my fake hand off.

559
00:31:09,816 --> 00:31:12,683
He started doing some kinky,
weird stuff,

560
00:31:12,918 --> 00:31:14,691
like he was worshipping it.

561
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:17,153
To cap it off,
he takes all my nail polish

562
00:31:17,205 --> 00:31:19,443
and paints each nail
a different color.

563
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:21,401
I liked it, so I kept doing it.

564
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,950
You know that guy on the news

565
00:31:22,988 --> 00:31:25,023
they arrested for the
ice-truck killings?

566
00:31:25,268 --> 00:31:27,002
Yeah, the one
who stuffs roadkill?

567
00:31:27,037 --> 00:31:29,003
- Is that the guy?
- No way.

568
00:31:29,106 --> 00:31:30,651
My trick, he's sexy.

569
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:33,003
- A freak, but sexy.
- Okay.

570
00:31:39,418 --> 00:31:42,462
From the beginning
and with more detail.

571
00:31:43,298 --> 00:31:46,283
Well, thanks for
the hospitality.

572
00:31:46,486 --> 00:31:48,623
Hey, thanks for the steaks.

573
00:31:48,888 --> 00:31:51,500
You know,
I didn't get a chance to ask.

574
00:31:51,606 --> 00:31:53,401
Deb mentioned that
you had a little --

575
00:31:53,446 --> 00:31:55,300
incident at
the crime scene.

576
00:31:56,057 --> 00:31:57,222
Did she?

577
00:31:57,456 --> 00:31:59,613
Well, most of my
prosthetic clients

578
00:31:59,697 --> 00:32:02,522
are pretty traumatized by
the time they get to me.

579
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:04,570
Anyway, I'm a good listener

580
00:32:04,635 --> 00:32:06,642
if you ever want to talk.

581
00:32:06,826 --> 00:32:09,202
Thanks, but unless
you know an expert in --

582
00:32:09,406 --> 00:32:11,470
repressed memories...

583
00:32:11,657 --> 00:32:12,873
For real?

584
00:32:14,968 --> 00:32:16,720
You know something about it?

585
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:19,281
More than I ever wanted to.

586
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:22,931
When I was in high school,
I started having these dreams

587
00:32:23,216 --> 00:32:25,282
of a woman hit by a truck.

588
00:32:27,148 --> 00:32:28,700
Who was she?

589
00:32:30,336 --> 00:32:31,643
I didn't know.

590
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,722
Then one day

591
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:37,802
I stopped by a mailbox,

592
00:32:38,096 --> 00:32:40,660
and it all came
crashing back...

593
00:32:42,648 --> 00:32:44,502
My mom

594
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,230
getting out to mail a letter,

595
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,662
me still in the car.

596
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,353
I watched her die.

597
00:32:59,008 --> 00:33:00,731
How old were you?

598
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:03,563
4.

599
00:33:06,015 --> 00:33:08,172
I didn't remember
anything till I --

600
00:33:08,456 --> 00:33:10,401
went and mailed a letter.

601
00:33:11,465 --> 00:33:15,013
Walked right into the belly of
the beast without knowing it.

602
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:20,311
What kind of memories
are you having?

603
00:33:24,648 --> 00:33:26,601
They're still a little vague.

604
00:33:26,665 --> 00:33:28,241
Right.

605
00:33:29,835 --> 00:33:32,001
Well, you're gonna have
to face it eventually.

606
00:33:34,008 --> 00:33:36,003
Maybe next time.

607
00:33:46,035 --> 00:33:48,230
When you see Deb,
go with white roses.

608
00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:49,550
They're her favorite.

609
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:54,062
That's a good tip.

610
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:57,701
It's funny how life brings
people together, huh?

611
00:34:08,607 --> 00:34:11,282
<i>Rudy misunderstands
my problem.</i>

612
00:34:11,656 --> 00:34:13,801
<i>I want the boy and
blood to go away,</i>

613
00:34:13,907 --> 00:34:15,622
<i>not come crashing back.</i>

614
00:34:15,895 --> 00:34:19,190
<i>Fortunately, I have other people's
problems to focus on right now.</i>

615
00:34:21,298 --> 00:34:23,252
<i>Like forgotten cellphones.</i>

616
00:34:28,555 --> 00:34:29,720
What do you got?

617
00:34:30,015 --> 00:34:32,651
Well, so far we're
chasing a ghost.

618
00:34:32,736 --> 00:34:35,421
Couple of employees
helped with the sketch, but

619
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,130
it's pretty generic.

620
00:34:37,426 --> 00:34:39,440
Only real lead we have
is a couple of numbers

621
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,830
he set at the crime scene.

622
00:34:40,866 --> 00:34:41,813
Screw the numbers.

623
00:34:41,855 --> 00:34:43,683
Who was killed?
Where are the bodies?

624
00:34:43,716 --> 00:34:45,833
I heard some pretty wild
theories out there.

625
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:47,240
Just theories.

626
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:48,951
We're still waiting
for full blood results.

627
00:34:48,988 --> 00:34:50,400
Damn it, Maria,
you're stalling.

628
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:52,240
I'm just trying to
avoid speculation.

629
00:34:52,277 --> 00:34:54,472
Well, you got to give
me something and soon.

630
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,772
This department can't afford
another public relations disaster.

631
00:34:57,858 --> 00:34:59,143
Well...

632
00:35:00,885 --> 00:35:03,502
Maybe you should tell the
D.A. to let Neil Perry go.

633
00:35:03,826 --> 00:35:05,512
He's not the ice-truck killer.

634
00:35:05,658 --> 00:35:08,052
Are you still hung up --
I can't believe this.

635
00:35:08,135 --> 00:35:10,573
Jesus, Maria,
that's not gonna happen.

636
00:35:12,935 --> 00:35:15,323
The D.A.
takes his cues from us.

637
00:35:15,496 --> 00:35:17,743
If you just tell him
you made a mistake...

638
00:35:17,978 --> 00:35:21,310
Not going to happen.
Now let it go.

639
00:35:22,978 --> 00:35:25,603
First break in this case,
you come straight to me.

640
00:35:36,298 --> 00:35:39,403
This may be a shot in the dark,
but I met this hooker last night.

641
00:35:39,435 --> 00:35:42,282
Going with a pro --
Now, that's how you get over the ex.

642
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:43,583
No, that's not what I mean.

643
00:35:43,618 --> 00:35:45,652
So you didn't fuck her.
But she blew you, right?

644
00:35:45,688 --> 00:35:47,232
Would you shut up?

645
00:35:48,056 --> 00:35:49,433
It was a lead.

646
00:35:49,675 --> 00:35:50,411
On what?

647
00:35:50,645 --> 00:35:52,733
I'll let you know
if it pans out, but

648
00:35:53,157 --> 00:35:56,271
what do you know about
amputee fetishes?

649
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:00,670
Oh, yeah.

650
00:36:01,315 --> 00:36:05,122
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know,
it's... it's called acrotomophilia.

651
00:36:05,638 --> 00:36:07,482
But don't let them
hear you call it that.

652
00:36:07,508 --> 00:36:09,003
It sounds like a disease.

653
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:11,883
No, they prefer to be
known as "devotees."

654
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:14,760
I knew you were the man to ask.

655
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:16,251
Not really.

656
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:19,141
I prefer a girl
with a kung fu grip.

657
00:36:20,495 --> 00:36:22,190
You know who you
should talk to?

658
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:24,632
It's... What's his face --
Deb's boyfriend.

659
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,680
Prosthetics guys deal with
devotees all the time.

660
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,352
Thanks.

661
00:36:35,628 --> 00:36:37,663
<i>No memory flashes here.</i>

662
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:39,900
<i>No little lost boy in blood.</i>

663
00:36:41,107 --> 00:36:42,601
<i>Maybe he went back to hiding</i>

664
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:45,500
<i>in the dormant reaches
of my cerebral cortex.</i>

665
00:36:47,298 --> 00:36:48,610
<i>Here's to hoping.</i>

666
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:54,071
- Yo, Dex.
- Hey.

667
00:36:56,307 --> 00:36:58,423
So, this is what
you do for a living?

668
00:37:00,457 --> 00:37:03,662
I'm trying to match castoff
patterns from a crime scene.

669
00:37:03,897 --> 00:37:05,722
A power tool was used.

670
00:37:06,496 --> 00:37:07,530
Here you go.

671
00:37:07,985 --> 00:37:09,360
Oh, thanks.

672
00:37:11,535 --> 00:37:13,163
Circular saw.

673
00:37:14,426 --> 00:37:17,333
Seems like there'd be an easier
way to make a mess like this.

674
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:20,052
Yeah, trust me. I know.
I've been in here for hours.

675
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:21,913
You know, in my line of work,

676
00:37:22,046 --> 00:37:23,991
you hear all sorts
of horror stories --

677
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,602
boat propellers,

678
00:37:25,856 --> 00:37:27,512
garbage disposals.

679
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:31,063
It seems like something
you'd see with a chainsaw.

680
00:37:31,097 --> 00:37:32,000
Yeah, I hear that.

681
00:37:32,056 --> 00:37:34,450
But this power tool was
plugged into a socket.

682
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:38,702
Guess you haven't heard
of an electric chainsaw.

683
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:45,360
Come on, people.
We're coming up empty.

684
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,273
Those numbers mean
something. 1-0-3.

685
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:51,181
We need to find the connection,
and until we do,

686
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:54,201
you need to go over every
page of every police report

687
00:37:54,227 --> 00:37:56,342
you wrote in the
last six months.

688
00:37:56,388 --> 00:37:59,153
Think.
1-0-3. 103.

689
00:37:59,308 --> 00:38:00,352
Bus station locker,

690
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:01,653
piece of a
bank account,

691
00:38:01,688 --> 00:38:02,673
area code,

692
00:38:02,746 --> 00:38:03,930
partial license plate.

693
00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:05,801
What is it?
I want answers.

694
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:16,572
What are you doing here?

695
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:19,182
How do you always do it?

696
00:38:19,787 --> 00:38:20,853
Do what?

697
00:38:21,117 --> 00:38:23,452
Make me feel like I'm 6
years old all the time.

698
00:38:25,905 --> 00:38:28,500
If this is about Rudy,
he was just picking up his cellphone.

699
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,793
Where'd he leave it?

700
00:38:31,755 --> 00:38:33,072
My apartment.

701
00:38:33,135 --> 00:38:34,700
What was he doing there?

702
00:38:35,108 --> 00:38:36,933
- Uh... eating steaks.
- And?

703
00:38:38,247 --> 00:38:40,853
Uh... I don't know.
Drinking beer.

704
00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:42,093
And?

705
00:38:42,475 --> 00:38:44,423
- Debra.
- And?

706
00:38:44,918 --> 00:38:46,602
- Talking?
- Talking.

707
00:38:46,805 --> 00:38:48,300
You talked.

708
00:38:48,355 --> 00:38:50,463
You opened your mouth,
and sounds came out.

709
00:38:50,506 --> 00:38:53,111
On the same night that I wanted to
talk to you, but you shut me out.

710
00:38:54,017 --> 00:38:56,173
- Oh.
- Yeah, "oh."

711
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:02,391
You don't talk to me, Dex.

712
00:39:03,546 --> 00:39:06,402
You've spent our entire lives
keeping me at a distance.

713
00:39:07,918 --> 00:39:10,530
But my boyfriend shows
up on your doorstep

714
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:13,200
- with a couple of T-bones --
- They were porterhouses.

715
00:39:15,308 --> 00:39:17,092
Porterhouses,

716
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:21,373
and you end up tossing beers back
into the middle of the night.

717
00:39:21,808 --> 00:39:23,791
Dex, you are all the
family that I have,

718
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,601
and I barely know you.

719
00:39:26,688 --> 00:39:29,313
So, if you're gonna eat steaks
with somebody after a rough day,

720
00:39:29,548 --> 00:39:31,422
if somebody's gonna break
through your fucking walls,

721
00:39:31,507 --> 00:39:32,872
I think it should be me.

722
00:39:32,925 --> 00:39:35,113
I think I have earned it.

723
00:39:44,786 --> 00:39:47,310
I'm late for Rita's deposition.

724
00:39:51,718 --> 00:39:54,202
Deb, it's hard for me.
You know that.

725
00:40:13,325 --> 00:40:15,003
You Rudy Cooper?

726
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,350
Angel Batista.

727
00:40:17,508 --> 00:40:19,352
I work with your
girlfriend, Debra.

728
00:40:19,385 --> 00:40:20,933
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

729
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:23,980
I'd like to ask you a few questions,
if you don't mind.

730
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:25,250
Sure.

731
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:27,401
Let me just
grab the door.

732
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:34,551
So,

733
00:40:34,895 --> 00:40:36,500
does this have
to do with a case?

734
00:40:36,998 --> 00:40:38,182
You could say that.

735
00:40:40,628 --> 00:40:42,580
Well, fire away.

736
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:46,533
Well, I ran into this lady
with a prosthetic hand --

737
00:40:46,726 --> 00:40:48,550
Call girl, actually.

738
00:40:48,825 --> 00:40:51,613
Said she had a
very unique client,

739
00:40:51,796 --> 00:40:54,393
an amputee devotee.

740
00:40:55,228 --> 00:40:57,180
You have a lead on this client?

741
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:58,502
That's the bitch of it.

742
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,403
I don't have
a goddamned clue,

743
00:41:00,605 --> 00:41:02,803
except for the
freaky sex stuff.

744
00:41:03,556 --> 00:41:05,061
I was hoping that you could

745
00:41:05,106 --> 00:41:07,372
steer me toward some
of those weirdos.

746
00:41:07,846 --> 00:41:10,991
I'm afraid I got into this business
to help people get better,

747
00:41:11,227 --> 00:41:13,003
not help people get off.

748
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,531
Yeah, I'm sure Debra will be
happy to hear that.

749
00:41:15,586 --> 00:41:17,301
But I can talk to some
of my colleagues,

750
00:41:17,355 --> 00:41:19,481
see if I can draw up a
list of contacts for you.

751
00:41:19,505 --> 00:41:20,660
That'd be great.

752
00:41:21,466 --> 00:41:24,560
How often does someone get a chance
to help catch a bad guy, huh?

753
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:29,053
You in a rush for
this information?

754
00:41:29,288 --> 00:41:32,292
No, no, I'm good.
I'm chasing a long shot, really.

755
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:35,680
Well, just...

756
00:41:37,115 --> 00:41:40,140
give me a call at the station
when you got something.

757
00:41:40,245 --> 00:41:41,550
Will do.

758
00:41:43,396 --> 00:41:44,991
Good to meet you.

759
00:41:46,146 --> 00:41:47,573
Good to meet you.

760
00:42:02,405 --> 00:42:03,902
Last question.

761
00:42:04,285 --> 00:42:05,931
According to
your ex-husband,

762
00:42:06,008 --> 00:42:08,503
you left town with your
boyfriend last weekend.

763
00:42:08,595 --> 00:42:10,893
That's right.
His father died.

764
00:42:11,268 --> 00:42:13,793
Did your ex-husband have
a scheduled visitation

765
00:42:13,846 --> 00:42:15,350
with his children
during that time?

766
00:42:16,388 --> 00:42:18,801
I told Paul I'd
make it up to him.

767
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,302
So, then he gave
you permission?

768
00:42:23,008 --> 00:42:24,201
No.

769
00:42:25,338 --> 00:42:28,590
I'm the one that gave him
visitation in the first place.

770
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:30,901
I'm the custodial parent.
I didn't have to do that.

771
00:42:31,526 --> 00:42:34,141
- Could you give us a second?
- Yes, of course.

772
00:42:35,455 --> 00:42:38,931
Why didn't you tell me you
broke your visitation agreement?

773
00:42:39,405 --> 00:42:42,122
I didn't know it
was a big deal.

774
00:42:43,635 --> 00:42:45,601
I think she's answered
that last question,

775
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,302
so unless there's
something else...

776
00:42:47,386 --> 00:42:48,771
No, that's fine.

777
00:42:48,908 --> 00:42:50,152
If I missed anything,

778
00:42:50,186 --> 00:42:53,320
we'll get to it at the psychiatric
evaluation next Wednesday.

779
00:42:54,095 --> 00:42:56,840
Nobody told me about any
psychiatric evaluation.

780
00:42:56,885 --> 00:42:58,651
It's mandatory in these cases.

781
00:42:58,705 --> 00:43:01,551
The psych test determines if
there's a competency hearing.

782
00:43:02,055 --> 00:43:03,460
For me?

783
00:43:03,606 --> 00:43:05,402
But he's the ex-con.

784
00:43:05,455 --> 00:43:07,303
It's standard.
Rita, you should be fine.

785
00:43:07,357 --> 00:43:08,852
Should be?

786
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:11,302
You mean she could
actually lose this?

787
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,701
Guys...

788
00:43:14,905 --> 00:43:16,750
I'm handcuffed here.

789
00:43:17,926 --> 00:43:20,552
You violated a
custody agreement.

790
00:43:20,908 --> 00:43:23,622
You struck your ex-husband
in your bedroom.

791
00:43:23,907 --> 00:43:25,660
He has a case.

792
00:43:32,766 --> 00:43:35,303
Mama,
look at my henna tattoo.

793
00:43:37,235 --> 00:43:39,581
- So, how much candy have you had?
- Lots.

794
00:43:39,628 --> 00:43:40,501
Thanks.

795
00:43:40,558 --> 00:43:43,252
- Now she'll never get to sleep.
- She'll calm down soon.

796
00:43:43,507 --> 00:43:45,502
This one's
already crashed.

797
00:43:45,547 --> 00:43:48,163
Mom, can my dad
read me a story?

798
00:43:48,498 --> 00:43:50,271
I don't think so, honey.

799
00:43:50,326 --> 00:43:52,302
Please?

800
00:43:55,256 --> 00:43:56,423
Okay.

801
00:43:56,626 --> 00:43:57,792
But just one.

802
00:43:58,027 --> 00:43:59,751
Put your duds on, buddy --

803
00:44:00,035 --> 00:44:01,902
Spider-man ones I bought you.

804
00:44:02,138 --> 00:44:04,480
I'll get him ready.
You've got 20 minutes left.

805
00:44:04,628 --> 00:44:06,353
Thanks, Betty.
Thank you.

806
00:44:06,668 --> 00:44:08,410
Hey, Rita.

807
00:44:09,016 --> 00:44:11,362
It doesn't have
to be this way.

808
00:44:11,506 --> 00:44:14,603
I mean, we can make this
easier on each other, right?

809
00:44:15,645 --> 00:44:17,001
I could drop the charges

810
00:44:17,038 --> 00:44:18,990
if you agree to
unsupervised visitation.

811
00:44:19,048 --> 00:44:20,362
Fuck you.

812
00:44:29,995 --> 00:44:31,510
Hey, Dexy.

813
00:44:33,595 --> 00:44:35,002
You know,
I don't think your girlfriend

814
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:37,952
appreciates the gravity
of the situation.

815
00:44:38,227 --> 00:44:41,281
If she loses that case,
she could lose the kids.

816
00:44:42,716 --> 00:44:45,153
- That won't happen.
- Never say "won't."

817
00:44:45,408 --> 00:44:47,050
We live in a world of wills --

818
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:48,602
Wills and wonders.

819
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:50,700
That's what I'm trying
to teach my children.

820
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:53,032
And they are my children, too,

821
00:44:53,195 --> 00:44:55,101
something she seems to forget.

822
00:44:55,715 --> 00:44:58,290
Okay, so I made some mistakes,

823
00:44:58,477 --> 00:45:00,592
but I learned from it, right?

824
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:02,512
Hey, I'm sober.

825
00:45:02,887 --> 00:45:05,093
Look.
No needle marks.

826
00:45:05,548 --> 00:45:08,510
I got the fucking Alaskan pipeline
running through these veins,

827
00:45:09,336 --> 00:45:11,223
and all because of those --

828
00:45:11,255 --> 00:45:14,071
two little s of
love in the next room.

829
00:45:22,715 --> 00:45:25,402
My heart beats for
those two kids,

830
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:27,101
so if you or
that skinny bitch

831
00:45:27,137 --> 00:45:28,601
try to screw
with what's mine,

832
00:45:28,636 --> 00:45:30,952
I swear to God, I don't
care who I have to hurt --

833
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:41,652
<i>Harry's first rule was don't
get emotionally involved.</i>

834
00:45:42,258 --> 00:45:43,651
<i>I think this is why.</i>

835
00:45:44,057 --> 00:45:45,902
Astor, go brush your teeth.

836
00:45:51,108 --> 00:45:53,002
<i>Someone once said
it's easier dealing</i>

837
00:45:53,048 --> 00:45:54,903
<i>with other people's
problems than your own.</i>

838
00:45:57,306 --> 00:45:58,802
<i>They were wrong.</i>

839
00:46:21,655 --> 00:46:22,501
Paul?

840
00:46:24,808 --> 00:46:25,692
Dexter?

841
00:46:28,257 --> 00:46:29,603
Where were you?

842
00:46:29,806 --> 00:46:31,500
Taking out the trash.

843
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:32,863
Did you see Paul?

844
00:46:36,008 --> 00:46:37,903
When I was in the side yard,

845
00:46:37,937 --> 00:46:39,751
I heard the
front door open.

846
00:46:42,408 --> 00:46:45,403
Hey, my dad's car is gone.

847
00:46:58,955 --> 00:47:00,781
Let's face it, Paul.

848
00:47:01,897 --> 00:47:03,330
You've been a problem.

849
00:47:15,758 --> 00:47:17,203
It's time for you to go away.

850
00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:26,672
The ice-truck killer
case has been reopened.

851
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,071
Officially.

852
00:47:28,115 --> 00:47:30,601
We have new forensic
evidence that shows

853
00:47:30,706 --> 00:47:33,301
that the DNA from the blood
at the Marina View hotel

854
00:47:33,336 --> 00:47:36,303
matches the DNA
from his victims.

855
00:47:36,908 --> 00:47:37,923
What about Neil Perry?

856
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:39,652
Isn't he supposed to be
the ice-truck killer?

857
00:47:39,688 --> 00:47:42,832
All those questions should be
directed to captain Matthews.

858
00:47:42,906 --> 00:47:45,501
He's been personally
handling the Perry case.

859
00:47:45,706 --> 00:47:46,901
Oh, shit.

860
00:47:47,107 --> 00:47:49,442
I hope she told
the Captain.

861
00:47:53,467 --> 00:47:54,962
Who knew?

862
00:47:58,656 --> 00:48:00,533
Who knew about this?

863
00:48:00,805 --> 00:48:03,302
This is the first we're
hearing about it, Captain.

864
00:48:03,988 --> 00:48:05,932
<i>The ice-truck killer
is still at large.</i>

865
00:48:06,047 --> 00:48:07,152
Sure.

866
00:48:08,606 --> 00:48:10,083
I'll call you back.

867
00:48:15,837 --> 00:48:18,403
You overplayed
your hand, Maria.

868
00:48:19,398 --> 00:48:22,101
I gave you a chance
to make it right.

869
00:48:22,387 --> 00:48:25,202
- I told you --
- You don't tell me shit!

870
00:48:25,607 --> 00:48:27,103
This is my department.

871
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:29,202
I made you lieutenant.
Me.

872
00:48:29,405 --> 00:48:31,603
You were just another
spik detective.

873
00:48:32,145 --> 00:48:34,752
Nice, Tom.
Real nice.

874
00:48:35,055 --> 00:48:37,202
Your true colors
finally come out.

875
00:48:37,237 --> 00:48:38,502
Oh, no.

876
00:48:38,807 --> 00:48:42,200
No, you haven't seen
my true colors, Maria.

877
00:48:43,608 --> 00:48:45,470
But you're about to.

878
00:48:49,306 --> 00:48:51,602
Enjoy this office
while it's still yours.

879
00:49:01,508 --> 00:49:02,653
Thank you.

880
00:49:02,707 --> 00:49:03,701
Dexter.

881
00:49:12,597 --> 00:49:14,462
What happened?
What's wrong?

882
00:49:18,546 --> 00:49:19,701
It's Paul.

883
00:49:20,376 --> 00:49:22,212
I don't know all the details,
but he --

884
00:49:22,447 --> 00:49:24,642
violated Florida's
three strikes law.

885
00:49:27,508 --> 00:49:29,822
He's back in jail.

886
00:49:32,008 --> 00:49:34,202
<i>It is truly amazing
the things you can do</i>

887
00:49:34,236 --> 00:49:35,601
<i>when you put your mind to it.</i>

888
00:49:35,647 --> 00:49:38,501
- What's so funny, mom?
- Yeah, why are you laughing?

889
00:49:38,607 --> 00:49:40,230
<i>No problem is insurmountable.</i>

890
00:49:40,235 --> 00:49:43,452
<i>Not when you have the most
accessible evidence locker in Miami.</i>

891
00:49:47,157 --> 00:49:49,303
<i>Paul did need to go away.</i>

892
00:49:50,607 --> 00:49:52,130
This is the police.

893
00:49:53,007 --> 00:49:56,103
- Sir, you're going to have to
turn down the television.
<i>- But death wasn't the answer.</i>

894
00:49:56,305 --> 00:49:57,802
Police.
Open up.

895
00:49:59,418 --> 00:50:03,030
- We're coming in, Mr. Bennett.
<i>- Life in prison will do just fine.</i>

896
00:50:07,008 --> 00:50:09,260
<i>For now, at least, the
code of Harry remains...</i>

897
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:11,400
<i>unbroken.</i>

898
00:50:14,018 --> 00:50:16,281
Hey, get over here.

899
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:18,802
You're part of
this family, too.

900
00:51:17,315 --> 00:51:19,370
I need an ambulance
at 1228 Caldon Street.

901
00:51:19,407 --> 00:51:21,182
A guy's been stabbed.

902
00:51:21,325 --> 00:51:22,532
Stay with us.

903
00:51:23,165 --> 00:51:29,532
Hang in there, okay?
Keep looking at us.

904
00:51:35,956 --> 00:51:38,501
Heard they're dropping ice-truck
murder charges on Neil Perry.

905
00:51:38,536 --> 00:51:41,602
Yeah, I'm sure he'll be filing
a lawsuit any minute now.

906
00:51:41,706 --> 00:51:43,503
More shit for us to deal with.

907
00:51:43,537 --> 00:51:45,601
Speaking of which,
watch out for reporters out there.

908
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:47,703
They're still waiting on a
comment from the Captain.

909
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:51,822
So, things still rocky at home?

910
00:51:52,405 --> 00:51:53,852
Oh, with Rudy?

911
00:51:53,887 --> 00:51:54,952
Yeah.

912
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:56,880
I'm not calling
until he apologizes.

913
00:51:56,927 --> 00:51:58,620
I'm done being
second choice.

914
00:51:58,667 --> 00:51:59,851
Good for you, Morgan.

915
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:04,392
If you're not
doing anything tonight,

916
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:07,012
Masuka's invited us
to the Bel Canto.

917
00:52:24,216 --> 00:52:25,323
For you.

918
00:52:25,597 --> 00:52:26,972
It's too late.
You blew it.

919
00:52:27,058 --> 00:52:29,210
I did blow it. This is the first
chance I've had to talk.

920
00:52:29,307 --> 00:52:30,703
I'm too tired to talk.

921
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:33,601
Well...

922
00:52:33,756 --> 00:52:35,390
let's go home,

923
00:52:35,706 --> 00:52:37,200
fall into bed.

924
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:38,501
Why, Rudy?

925
00:52:39,606 --> 00:52:40,523
I mean, fucking why?

926
00:52:40,556 --> 00:52:41,187
You didn't want to fall
into bed the other night

927
00:52:41,187 --> 00:52:43,601
when I laid my heart
out on the phone.

928
00:52:44,007 --> 00:52:45,302
You wanted to
talk to my brother.

929
00:52:45,338 --> 00:52:46,352
I was confused.

930
00:52:46,386 --> 00:52:48,602
Well, I'm not confused. That's
the problem, I know what I want.

931
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:50,101
I was confused
because I love you.

932
00:52:50,127 --> 00:52:52,603
What I want is very
simple and uncomplicated.

933
00:52:53,858 --> 00:52:55,103
What did you say?

934
00:52:55,135 --> 00:52:56,700
I love you.

935
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:00,303
Don't try to...

936
00:53:04,678 --> 00:53:05,840
Fuck.

937
00:53:05,866 --> 00:53:07,022
What?

938
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,502
I love you, too.

939
00:53:20,508 --> 00:53:22,153
What happened to your lip?

940
00:53:22,186 --> 00:53:25,283
I'm just, uh... incident with
a tool at the workshop.

941
00:53:27,588 --> 00:53:30,973
Well, let's get you home
and take care of it.

942
00:54:00,587 --> 00:54:02,793
<i>So, this is doom.</i>

943
00:54:03,305 --> 00:54:05,253
<i>I've been the architect
of so much of it.</i>

944
00:54:05,285 --> 00:54:08,002
<i>It's only fair I should know
what all the fuss is all about.</i>

945
00:54:09,857 --> 00:54:12,391
<i>He left me this
room for a reason.</i>

946
00:54:12,605 --> 00:54:14,821
<i>Five women gave
their blood, their lives</i>

947
00:54:14,857 --> 00:54:16,500
<i>for this moment.</i>

948
00:54:18,058 --> 00:54:20,601
<i>There's only one
way to find out why.</i>

949
00:54:30,718 --> 00:54:33,242
Close your eyes, Dexter.

950
00:54:33,435 --> 00:54:35,540
I want mama.

951
00:54:35,918 --> 00:54:40,141
No!
Not in front of my baby!

952
00:54:40,427 --> 00:54:46,920
Oh, god.
Please don't cry.

953
00:54:46,956 --> 00:54:51,163
It's gonna be okay.

954
00:54:51,337 --> 00:54:58,681
Don't you dare!
Not in front of my baby!

955
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:00,330
No!

956
00:55:03,716 --> 00:55:09,261
Close your eyes, Dexter.
Don't look.

957
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:11,800
Dexter.
Close your eyes.

958
00:55:12,035 --> 00:55:17,293
I want mama!

959
00:55:17,296 --> 00:55:22,551
I want mama!

960
00:55:22,558 --> 00:55:26,121
Mommy loves you, Dexter.
