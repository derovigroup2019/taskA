1
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,359
Previously on "Dexter"...

2
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,863
Open up, Perry, it's the police.
Open up.

3
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,198
Hey, Angel, I got him!

4
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,867
They really found
the ice-truck killer?

5
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,578
I saw him, Dex. I chased him.

6
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,081
The fun part was
hanging them like cattle

7
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,083
right before I
cut their throats.

8
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,293
Son of a bitch.

9
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,296
I have so many
questions for him.

10
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,089
What was his message to me?

11
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,592
Now I need to know him.

12
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,384
Hi.

13
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,678
The fuck are you?

14
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,183
Paul Bennett, father on parole.

15
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:25,771
Dexter Morgan.
I can't think of anything clever to say.

16
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,065
Divorce papers --
sign them now,

17
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,359
and I'll agree to supervised
visits twice a week.

18
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,694
You think you can really
make me back down?

19
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,363
Are you fucking my wife?

20
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,367
I just wish he'd go away.

21
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,994
I mean, why can't he just go
away and disappear forever?

22
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,872
All along,
I thought this was a game

23
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,083
my alter ego and
I were playing.

24
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,962
But relationships
change, evolve,

25
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,382
and this one's getting deep.

26
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,967
I realize now my
days are numbered.

27
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,471
So I'd better make
the most of them.

28
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,184
Your instincts were dead-on.

29
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,062
They're always dead-on when it
comes to killers. Why is that?

30
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,689
I'm watchin' you.

31
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,163
What are we looking at here?

32
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,668
I'm thinking two circus
clowns dancing. You?

33
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,878
No, it looks like a lobster.
See the claws?

34
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,593
Why do bloodstains always
look like crustaceans to you?

35
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,678
I like seafood.

36
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,764
Rorschach would say you have a
hard time relating to others.

37
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,477
- Not as hard as her.
- It does look like a suicide.

38
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,771
Can I get some light
in here, please?

39
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,481
- Damn power outages.
- I don't know, Angel.

40
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,692
Most firearm suicides
are committed by men.

41
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:57,195
Women slash their wrists,
take pills, something more ladylike.

42
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,282
Not in Miami.
We closed a couple of suicide cases

43
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,576
just like this last year, remember?

44
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,291
- WOOH
- Look at this mess.

45
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,460
That's a fancy bathtub.
Rich husband?

46
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,296
House husband and
aspiring artist.

47
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,466
Ooh. Promising.
So, she supported him?

48
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,383
It looks like that.

49
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,594
She was some kind of
big-time prosecutor.

50
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,181
Those other suicides we closed -- those
were high-powered women too, right?

51
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,600
I don't know. I think so.

52
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,977
Note to self.

53
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,273
I don't care what it looks like.
Somebody killed her.

54
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,692
We're checking out
all the possibilities.?

55
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,570
Was your wife dealing with
any emotional problem?

56
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,489
You know, job stress,
the usual,

57
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,199
but she was working
through it in therapy.

58
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,493
She have any other problems
that you're aware of?

59
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,369
-?
- Are you listening to me?

60
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,871
Vanessa didn't kill herself.

61
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,289
Criminals stage
suicides all the time.

62
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,999
?

63
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,667
We'll check into it.

64
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,961
We need to collect your
clothes for evidence --

65
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,087
standard procedure.

66
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,061
Come on. I got to go.
There's a dead body in that house.

67
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:15,273
- There's a hot body in here.
- I so want to maul you right now.

68
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,276
I so want you to.
Call me when you're done, okay?

69
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,695
I'll bring handcuffs.

70
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,666
Morgan, what took you so long?

71
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,377
Playing "hide the salami"
with Mr. Prosthetics?

72
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,796
- I don't fuck and tell.
- Since when?

73
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,966
Can we go inside?
I'm kind of wet. Don't.

74
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,759
No, I need you to?

75
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,178
find out about the
victim's relationship with her husband.

76
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,680
It's always the husband, right?

77
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,183
Looks like a suicide, but you never
know -- younger guy, unemployed.

78
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,060
Maybe he was a boy toy and
killed her for her money.

79
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,186
I'm on it.

80
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,774
Doakes is sending you away
from a crime scene in rain

81
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,276
and you're not
putting up a fight?

82
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,862
- I'm a team player.
- You are?

83
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,196
Fuck you!

84
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,285
Oh, hey, Dex, come on in.

85
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,959
- Where's Rita?
- Uh, she's stuck in traffic.

86
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,086
Power's out in half the city.

87
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,172
Of course,
I love the extra kid time, but, uh,

88
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,093
court supervisor --
not so much.

89
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,973
Hey, you know, I feel really bad
about the last time I was here.

90
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,893
I didn't mean to get
all alpha male on you.

91
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:33,768
?

92
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,895
What are you supposed
to say to the guy

93
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,188
who's f'ing your wife
while you're in jail?

94
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,193
Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

95
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,779
Thanks for holding
down the fort.

96
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,281
Do you mind if I get going?

97
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,491
I got kids of my own
at home to look after.

98
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,368
No, no, no. It's okay.
Dexter and I are here now.

99
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,662
Great. Thank you. Bye, kids.

100
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,581
Mom, Dexter,
the lights are out.

101
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,666
They are?
Hey, I brought hot chocolate.

102
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,670
- Dad already made us some.
- With extra marshmallows.

103
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,965
- Tag -- you're it!
- I'd love some hot chocolate.

104
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,968
Take two. Looks like he's got extra.
Come here, buddy.

105
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:13,266
Mom, can dad stay and
put us to bed, please?

106
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,393
I think that's why
Dexter's here, sweetie.

107
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,187
- Dexter doesn't mind.
- Yay!

108
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,690
Only a song, no story --
it's way past your bedtime.

109
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,569
All right, bedbugs,
let's leave these two alone.

110
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,363
It's not like they
need a chaperone.

111
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,086
Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian,
and now Vanessa Gayle --

112
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,587
all three powerful women,

113
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,465
all three shot themselves
in the past two years.

114
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,592
They've got to have
more in common

115
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,470
than career ambition and
a fondness of firearms.

116
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,764
Why the sudden
interest in suicides?

117
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,558
Morbid curiosity.

118
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,563
What can I do for you?
So many things.

119
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,066
I need the blood-spatter
report on Vanessa Gayle.

120
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,697
Blood spatter's inconclusive.
All I can tell is

121
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,866
she was shot at close range.
I wish I had more for you.

122
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,368
Me too.

123
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,665
Maria, the D.A. needs the work
sheet for the ice-truck-killer case.

124
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,584
I'm working on it.
When'd you talk to the D.A.?

125
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,961
We had dinner last night.

126
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,880
Mayor Allen took us out to
celebrate Neil Perry's arrest --

127
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,465
Hell of a good time.

128
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,177
Hmm. Iro de puta.

129
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,471
I'm the one who gets
Perry to confess and

130
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,266
- he's got the mayor kissing his ass.
- I wouldn't be too upset.

131
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,977
Matthews will be the one with
the egg on his face soon enough.

132
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,895
You still believe we
got the wrong guy?

133
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,480
Perry's the pretender
to the throne.

134
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,774
The real king is still out there,
and he'll kill again.

135
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,067
It's just a matter of time.

136
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:50,071
Or the ice-truck killer will use
Perry as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

137
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,868
You really think
that might happen?

138
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:58,872
If Perry's the wrong guy
and I let him take the fall,

139
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,792
definitely. Thanks, Dexter.

140
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,462
What if Laguerta's right?

141
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,590
What if the ice-truck
killer does disappear?

142
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,471
No. He's got unfinished
business with me.

143
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,475
Still, I can't just sit on my hands
waiting for something to happen.

144
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,186
I need a distraction.

145
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,898
Nothing like some
little debbies

146
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,358
and a worthy new adversary
to clear my head.

147
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,785
Talk to me, ladies.
What do you have in common?

148
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,998
Same sorority?
Pilates instructor?

149
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,476
Dr. Emmett Meridian.

150
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,860
The three suicide sisters
shared the same therapist --

151
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,570
Dr. Emmett Meridian.

152
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,573
He must be terrible at his job.

153
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,296
So far,
he comes up squeaky clean --

154
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,966
no malpractice suit,
no disgruntled patients.

155
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,468
And I thought I was a
master at damage control.

156
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,388
Perhaps I should schedule a
session with the good doctor

157
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,765
and try out a little
reverse psychology.

158
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,393
Come on in, Sean. Have a seat.

159
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,187
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

160
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,565
Hey, I expect the police to
show up when I call, right?

161
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,276
The least I can do is clear my
lunch hour for a cop in need.

162
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,572
So, what brought you here?

163
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,284
A friend of mine died.

164
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,162
She killed herself.

165
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,584
- I need to understand why.
- How come?

166
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,295
She had everything going for her.
It doesn't make sense.

167
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,463
To some people,
death makes perfect sense.

168
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,176
Life -- now, that's the puzzle,

169
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:20,180
like you, Sean.
What really brought you here?

170
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,181
I just told you I came --

171
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,892
To talk about your friend's suicide,
I know.

172
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:28,188
I think you're using this suicide
deal as an excuse to come see me.

173
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,484
You're absolutely right.

174
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,990
How could you tell?

175
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,285
I'm sensing you do it a lot to
keep the world at arm's length.

176
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,997
And what are my
real intentions?

177
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,170
As soon as I pay for my lunch,

178
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,299
you're gonna tell me that.
Excuse me a second.

179
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,677
Judging from what I've seen so far,
I probably will.

180
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,387
This guy's good.

181
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,474
So why do his
patients keep dying?

182
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,772
Vanessa's estimated time of
death was Monday at 7:00 p.m.

183
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,858
Meridian was in session
with Scott Solomon.

184
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,278
I wonder if Mr.
Solomon kept his appointment that night.

185
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,993
So, we got almond chicken

186
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,162
pork fried rice.

187
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,998
So, Sean, let's start with the basics.
You married?

188
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,791
No.

189
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,793
Girlfriend?

190
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,586
Yes.

191
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,796
Sex life?

192
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,298
It's personal.

193
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,593
And this is therapy,
where we share personal things.

194
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,559
You know, it might help me open up
if you shared something about yourself.

195
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,561
Why did you become a psychiatrist?

196
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,981
See what you just did?

197
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,775
Trying to take
control like that?

198
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,988
You probably get away with it
most of the time, too, right?

199
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,991
That's a way of preventing other
people from getting close to you.

200
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,660
Let me ask you something, Sean.

201
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,792
Have you ever been
close to anybody?

202
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,173
My foster father.

203
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,761
He's the only one who
ever really knew me.

204
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,263
You're adopted?

205
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,475
Harry took me in when I was 3.

206
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:31,978
So tell me about Harry.

207
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,063
What kind of stuff did
you guys do together?

208
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,859
You know,
normal father-son stuff.

209
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,786
All right. Stop. Enough.

210
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:56,669
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

211
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,379
Nice ambush.

212
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,882
That was the perfect
point of attack.

213
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,592
I can't believe I
finally got you.

214
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,260
I won.

215
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,474
- This isn't a game, Dexter.
- No, I know.

216
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:13,269
- It's not supposed to be fun.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's just --

217
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,188
You think I want to
teach you these things?

218
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,691
This is the only way I know how to
keep you out of an electric chair.

219
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,196
This is about survival,
Dex, nothing else.

220
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,490
Got it?

221
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,883
You've got a visitor, Perry.

222
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,595
- Miss me?
- Don't flatter yourself.

223
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:51,182
I have to comb through your
case before the trial,

224
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,975
make sure I have
my facts straight

225
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,894
on the notorious
ice-truck killer.

226
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:58,564
Um, I confessed.
What more do you need?

227
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,066
The evidence to line up.

228
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:03,361
We haven't been able to match
your prints against the partial

229
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,863
on the lozenge wrapper we found
at the abandoned hospital.

230
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,574
Liquid nitrogen --
I use it to freeze the body parts.

231
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,867
It's extremely effective,

232
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,370
but it burns like a bitch.

233
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,996
Oh.

234
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,791
Or you knew your
prints wouldn't match,

235
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,669
so you purposely burned
your fingertips to hide it.

236
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,296
Are you suggesting
that I'm a liar?

237
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,090
Just covering my bases, Neil.

238
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,259
We both want the same thing.

239
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,178
Uh... 10 minutes
alone with Angelina?

240
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,889
To see you convicted.

241
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,479
What's in it for me if
I help you do your job?

242
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,772
Hmm...

243
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,192
How about immortality?

244
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,991
We found your mother's
body under your house.

245
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,869
Now, you can go down as a
pathetic loser who killed mom

246
00:15:54,287 --> 00:16:00,084
or the most heinous killer
in Florida's history --

247
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,295
your choice.

248
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,469
If I'm going to become a legend,

249
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,388
I need to be memorialized.

250
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,266
I want a reporter here to
interview me -- front page.

251
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,768
You're not allowed to talk to
the press before the trial.

252
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,479
If you want me to cooperate,

253
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,066
I'm sure you'll find a way.

254
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,494
Meridian had one thing right.
I do crave control.

255
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,998
The longer the ice-truck killer
maintains radio silence,

256
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,583
the less control I have.

257
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,462
Craigslist --
it's desperate, I know,

258
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,380
but apropos.

259
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,467
Personal ads are filled
with desperation.

260
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,260
"Tyler from Key West,"

261
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,596
"speedos tanning on the beach,"

262
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,765
"touched your tits
on Friday night" --

263
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,184
At least these folks
aren't just standing by

264
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,687
waiting for something to happen,
and neither am I.

265
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,068
"Dear Ken, I'm in pieces.

266
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,987
Why the cold shoulder?

267
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,781
Love, Barbie."

268
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,298
Hey, I got it.

269
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,094
Thanks.

270
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,680
Hey, I know you --
Monday night at Meridian's.

271
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,266
You're always leaving your 7:00
when I'm arriving for my 8:00.

272
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,060
- You missed last week, right?
- No, I was there.

273
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,771
I don't remember ever
seeing you, though.

274
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,065
- How do you like him?
- Meridian?

275
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,068
Best thing that's ever
happened to me...

276
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,278
so far.

277
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,489
How about you?
You finding him helpful?

278
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,158
I'm a sociopath.
There's not much he can do for me.

279
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:00,997
Cute and funny.
Let me guess -- taken.

280
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,874
- Girlfriend.
- Lucky girl.

281
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,669
Well, thanks for the help,
but I can handle it from here.

282
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:07,461
All right.

283
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,173
So Meridian has an alibi
for the time of death.

284
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,260
My sexual hang-ups and
control issues aside,

285
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,970
I need a follow-up appointment

286
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,764
to dig a little deeper.

287
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,059
Isn't that what
therapy's all about?

288
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,471
Oh, my god.

289
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,264
I love your body.

290
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,896
I love your legs.

291
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,567
I love your arms.

292
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,279
I couldn't have made
them better myself.

293
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,282
Hey.

294
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,286
Are you crying?

295
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,789
I'm fine.

296
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,085
Then what?

297
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,089
I don't know.

298
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:39,387
I'm sure this is really hot,
crying after sex.

299
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,972
Everything about you is hot.

300
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,269
Tell me what you're feeling.

301
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,276
It's...

302
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,280
It's just...

303
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,159
Every time I've ever been
naked with someone...

304
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,872
..we just fuck.

305
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,459
But not this time?

306
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,171
This is different.

307
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,590
It feels like...

308
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,471
I hate saying this.
It sounds so fucking cheesy.

309
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,558
It feels like making love.

310
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,184
Ew.

311
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,064
Yes.

312
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,986
But, ew,
promise me you'll never say that again.

313
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,574
What if I do?
Are you gonna cry about it?

314
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,162
You're so fucked up.

315
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,581
What's up, rock star?

316
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:55,588
Look at you.
What you doing? Hey.

317
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,883
Where's the supervisor?

318
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,260
Oh, she called on my
cell and canceled.

319
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,095
Who wants to play monster tag?

320
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,680
- I do.
- Yeah?

321
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,767
I'm coming after you.
You better run.

322
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,270
Paul, you know you're not
allowed unsupervised visits.

323
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,398
I know.
Big bad Paul needs a babysitter.

324
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,193
It's your day off, right?

325
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,487
Now, would it really be so terrible

326
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,572
if we spent time with
our kids together?

327
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:25,367
- I have a lunch date with Dexter.
- Come on. It'll be fun.

328
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,496
Mom, dad, come on.

329
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,796
I guess I could call Dexter.

330
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,466
It's official --
I'm nominating you for mom of the year.

331
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,887
Here comes the monster.
Here comes the monster.

332
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,479
Contrary to what Dr.
Meridian thinks,

333
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,981
I don't always keep
others at a distance.

334
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,859
Things are looking up already.

335
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,280
Hey Barbie how would you
like to suck my cock?

336
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,573
Or not.

337
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,285
Clearly nobody here is my
missing partner in crime.

338
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,497
Hey, what's up?
You were looking for me?

339
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,291
What did forensics come
back with on Vanessa Gayle?

340
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,294
Gunpowder on her hand,
none on her husband's,

341
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,089
high-angle trajectory,
no drugs in the tox screen.

342
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,675
It all points to suicide.

343
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,969
- No chance it was murder?
- Too bad, huh?

344
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,679
I had the husband pegged, too.

345
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,098
Was hoping he could help me
score my own sugar mama.

346
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,975
- Try Craigslist.
- I already did --

347
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,562
Nothing but cat ladies
and saggy tits.

348
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,859
Miami Metro can close
this case as a suicide,

349
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,862
but I'm still not convinced.

350
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,657
Maybe my new therapist can
shed some light on my doubts.

351
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,286
You seem on edge today.

352
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,374
I'm not getting what
I came here for.

353
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,584
What'd you come here for?

354
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,880
We established in our last visit that
it wasn't to talk about suicide.

355
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,882
- Or feelings.
- Heaven forbid.

356
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,260
So, what do you
want to talk about?

357
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,761
Fakes --

358
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,975
people who pass themselves
off as something they're not.

359
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,270
- Like a pre-owned-car salesman?
- A brave politician.

360
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:20,190
- A jew for Jesus.
- A wolf in sheep's clothing.

361
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,862
Is that how you feel, Sean?

362
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,780
Like you're hiding
a dark secret?

363
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,576
- No, I wasn't talking about me.
- Who were you talking about?

364
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,376
You.

365
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,881
That's a common first-time
reaction to therapy.

366
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,966
You think I can't
care about you,

367
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,094
that I'm only pretending to care
because I have another motive.

368
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,472
- Bingo.
- You got me.

369
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:55,184
I do have another motive.
It's called a paycheck.

370
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,770
But that doesn't mean that
I can't care for my patients

371
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,190
or enjoy my job.
How are things at your job?

372
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,360
Frustrating, to
tell you the truth.

373
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,862
- What kind of forensics do you do?
- Blood spatter.

374
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,573
Most people can't stand blood.

375
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,575
I hate it.

376
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:14,787
Categorizing and analyzing
must be very soothing for you.

377
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,959
Yeah, it is, actually.

378
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,795
So, okay,
how are things with your girlfriend?

379
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,464
She canceled lunch with me
to be with her ex-husband.

380
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,298
Ouch.

381
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,677
Sounds like things are out
of your control right now.

382
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,470
No wonder you cut yourself
off from your emotions.

383
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,389
That way you never have
to feel powerless.

384
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,058
So, then, what should I do?

385
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,894
Accept that certain things
are out of your hands.

386
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,187
Let go.

387
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,693
Hey, Morgan -- I can't believe,
out of two million sperm,

388
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,069
you were the fastest swimmer.

389
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,863
What are you gonna do about it?

390
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,574
I wanted to kill him, dad.

391
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,494
It must have been tough
for you to walk away, son.

392
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,497
I'm proud that you did that.

393
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,375
Don't be,
because I still want to kill him.

394
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,293
When's that gonna go away?

395
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,465
I think I have everything I need,
Mr. Perry.

396
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,967
When's the story gonna run?

397
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,886
Well, they're saving space for tomorrow,
front page.

398
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,680
I just got to get
back and write.

399
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,392
Thanks so much for your time.

400
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,188
- How was your interview?
- It was fine.

401
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,982
You ready to talk
about the case?

402
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:29,278
Sure, as soon as I get
to talk to a reporter.

403
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,572
- You just did.
- Oh, give me a break.

404
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,782
That poser was one
of your cop buddies,

405
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,575
but nice try.

406
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:37,661
In case you forgot, Neil,
you're the one in jail.

407
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,787
I call the shots.

408
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,790
I could invoke my Miranda rights
at any time and lawyer up.

409
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,169
If you wanted a lawyer
you'd have one by now.

410
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,966
I know your game, lieutenant.

411
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,761
You think I'm a fraud and
you're trying to prove it,

412
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:57,890
but the truth is
you're the fraud.

413
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,185
You know what, Neil?

414
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,270
I'm really not in the
mood for your shit today.

415
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,064
I found out how
you got promoted.

416
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:15,074
Back when you and sergeant
Doakes were still partners,

417
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,992
Doakes got the drop on
a major coke dealer,

418
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,495
- brought you along for the ride.
- How did you get --

419
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,789
when the perp bailed from
a third-story apartment,

420
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,373
Doakes took the fire escape,

421
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,376
sent you to cover the
stairs just in case.

422
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,797
Only you got lucky

423
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,882
and you made the headline grab,

424
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,884
and so the legend began.

425
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,971
I wonder if Doakes would
have made a good lieutenant.

426
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,975
- I deserved that promotion.
- I'm sure you did.

427
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,560
It was a big bust.

428
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,773
Not as big as
catching me, of course, but, uh,

429
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,358
let's be honest.

430
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,360
You didn't catch me.

431
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,278
Your captain did.

432
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,578
At least that's what
they're saying on the news.

433
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,798
My therapist wants me to accept the
things that are out of my hands.

434
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,884
Tragically for him,
he's not out of my hands,

435
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:19,263
not if I can find proof
that the death of at least

436
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:22,182
three women under his care
was not a coincidence.

437
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,981
Where are you? Rita.

438
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,275
Breaking and entering.

439
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,789
I hope he got my good side.

440
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:56,466
Now, what's he recording
for posterity's sake?

441
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,565
Goodbye, Dexter.

442
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,069
Hello, ladies.

443
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,365
I need another prescription.

444
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,285
I'm sorry, Vanessa.
I can't do that.

445
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:28,665
Just one more, please.

446
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,168
We talked about this.

447
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,964
The antidepressants
were a temporary crutch

448
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,175
so that you could start
taking steps on your own.

449
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:42,262
But you don't understand.
I can't do this on my own.

450
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,681
I can't even get
out of fucking bed.

451
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,896
I just -- I want to die.

452
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,982
Look at me.

453
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,487
I understand the
appeal of death, okay?

454
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,197
No more pain.

455
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:04,576
All the career pressure,
the hopelessness, gone.

456
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,578
In many cultures,

457
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,789
there's no stigma attached
to taking one's life.

458
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,374
Suicide's respected,

459
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,460
even revered as a matter
of personal conscience.

460
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,297
How do most people do it?

461
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,884
Well, painkillers
are the most common.U KNOW

462
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,387
But they're
entirely unreliable.

463
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,764
The truly courageous
of heart...

464
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,475
use guns.

465
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:35,190
You took women who trusted you at
their weakest possible moment,

466
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,277
and rather than help them,
you suggested they end it all.

467
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,571
God, you even gave them
permission to use a gun.

468
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,075
You're a mean one, Mr. Shrink.

469
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,161
Create their drug addiction,
pull them off,

470
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,373
then fill their addled heads
with noble thoughts of suicide.

471
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,293
I think I've had a
breakthrough in therapy.

472
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,175
Come over. I Need you. Rita.

473
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,057
Hey, I got your texts.
Is everything...

474
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:17,065
- ..okay?
- It is now.

475
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,194
Okay, just,
I wanted to see you.

476
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,364
I felt bad about missing lunch

477
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,366
to be with Paul and the kids.

478
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,785
I hope you didn't
get the wrong idea.

479
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,871
No, of course not.

480
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,460
How'd it go?

481
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:41,173
Really good and
incredibly scary.

482
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,884
For the first time
in a long while, I

483
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,179
saw how easy it would be for me
to fall back into my old life.

484
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,057
- Why is that scary?
- Because...

485
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,976
I like my new life.

486
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,978
And I finally feel
like I'm in control.

487
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,897
I never felt that
way with Paul.

488
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,483
I do with you.

489
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:11,578
This is a disaster.
I chose Rita because she was damaged.

490
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,580
If she gets better,
I'll lose her for sure.

491
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,087
I'm ready, Dexter.

492
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,262
Oh.

493
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:33,392
I don't know what I've
been so afraid of.

494
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,894
You're the perfect boyfriend.

495
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,070
I want you to spend the night,
for real.

496
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,871
I'm so sorry.

497
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,167
I came over here because I
thought something was wrong.

498
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,671
But tonight's really
not a good night.

499
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,591
I'm right in the middle of a case.
I'm way too distracted.

500
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:10,178
Now? It's so late.

501
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,597
That's all the more reason
to get back to work.

502
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,269
The clock's ticking. Here.

503
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,483
But I'll call you
tomorrow. Okay?

504
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,362
Okay.

505
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,075
Shit.

506
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,870
I can't have sex with Rita.
Every time I sleep with a woman,

507
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,998
she sees me for what I really am --
empty --

508
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,667
and then she's gone.

509
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,590
But I don't want Rita to go,

510
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,468
which means I have
to deal with this.

511
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:53,471
I can't kill Meridian yet.
I need another therapy session.

512
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,783
Stay where you are. I'm armed.

513
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,495
With bad puns?

514
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,378
You said you needed a favor.
What's up?

515
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,379
Take off your pants.

516
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,298
Oh, I should have known it
was that kind of favor.

517
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,091
You never ask me to
come by before work.

518
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,177
No, but I like
the way you think.

519
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,387
I have a patient

520
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,890
who lost both her legs
in a car accident,

521
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,892
- really brutal.
- Like your mom?

522
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,563
Which is why I want to do
something special for her.

523
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:48,568
I want to give her a new
smokin' pair of legs --

524
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,196
- yours.
- No.

525
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,572
- Let me just take a cast.
- No way. no.

526
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,575
It'll take 20 minutes, tops.
Come on, please?

527
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,996
Stop being such a chick.
Sit down.

528
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,561
Feels good.

529
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,159
Can I make one of your cock?

530
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,287
That'd be a hell of a story
to tell the bullpen, huh?

531
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,789
Not likely.

532
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,458
I haven't told anyone about us.

533
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,669
Embarrassed about
banging Captain Hook?

534
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,173
- Not even a little.
- Then why?

535
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,886
I guess this matters to me.

536
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,056
So if I talk about
it and it goes away,

537
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,686
I'm actually losing something.

538
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,982
That retarded?

539
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,485
No.

540
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,697
But I got to tell you,

541
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,491
I'm not going anywhere.

542
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:20,869
Seriously?

543
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,587
And neither are you,

544
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,466
'cause I got your leg.

545
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,397
- Where the hell you been?
- With my boyfriend.

546
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,066
- Boyfriend?
- Yep.

547
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,984
We just fucked in his office.

548
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:56,488
And we're having
dinner tomorrow night.

549
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,576
- You looking for me?
- Yeah. Shut the door.

550
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,082
Did you tell anyone
about our bust,

551
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,959
the one that got me promoted?

552
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:10,669
No.

553
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,089
Nobody in the press?

554
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,965
Maria, we talked about
this when it happened.

555
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,677
It would fuck up your rep and
make me look like a whiny bitch.

556
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:19,969
It's bad for both of us.

557
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,264
So then the only way to
access that information

558
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,683
would be to read to
police report, right?

559
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,894
I guess.

560
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:33,191
We have to have our
firewall checked.

561
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,862
She was sitting on top of me,
basically naked...

562
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,866
..asking me to spend the night,

563
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,869
and I didn't know what to do.

564
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,664
It's okay, Sean.
Don't beat yourself up.

565
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,292
Your girlfriend really means
something to you. I know that.

566
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,087
If she means something,
why do I run away from her?

567
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:56,673
The same reason you work so hard
to shut everybody else out.

568
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,591
You're afraid they won't
like what they see.

569
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,468
Yeah, I think you're right.

570
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,888
How can I change that?

571
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,765
Well, for starters,
you accept the fact

572
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,768
that we all have a big,
bad wolf hiding inside of us,

573
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,063
a darkness we don't want
anyone else to see.

574
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,275
- Do you?
- Of course I do.

575
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,696
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

576
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:22,365
And how do you deal
with your wolf?

577
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,285
Well, first of all,
I accepted that it was there.

578
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,787
I made friends with it.

579
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,168
And now I just let it out for
a big meal once in a while.

580
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,088
At least three times
that we know about.

581
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:42,385
- Can we get back to the sex thing?
- This is all about sex.

582
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,096
The reason you avoid
sexual intimacy

583
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,557
is because you don't want
to surrender control.

584
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:50,059
No, I've surrendered control.
It's not like my

585
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,062
girlfriend hasn't been,
you know, south of the border.

586
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,857
That's not what I'm talking about.
Intimacy --

587
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,360
really letting go
face-to-face --

588
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,988
there's nothing more
difficult than that.

589
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,866
The minute you start
to accept who you are,

590
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:09,078
you just might feel free enough
to share that intimacy together.

591
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,880
What are you doing?

592
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,883
I'd like to talk you through
a deep-relaxation technique.

593
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,093
It might bring some
things to the surface.

594
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,595
What kinds of things?

595
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,097
There must have been
a time in your life

596
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,183
when you felt powerless, right?

597
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:33,269
Foster child,
no control over your destiny.

598
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,272
If we can bring some of those
memories to the surface,

599
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,191
we might find the root
of your control issues.

600
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,193
First, I want you
to close your eyes

601
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,487
and focus on your breathing.

602
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,573
I want you to count
each breath, okay?

603
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,492
In, 1,

604
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,662
and out, 2. Just give it a try.

605
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,791
This is ridiculous.
I could be killing him right now.

606
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,960
Now I want you to
think of a time

607
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,297
When you felt completely

608
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,884
and totally powerless.

609
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,477
Hey, Morgan.
You still fucking your sister?

610
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:15,770
Leave me alone, Josh.

611
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,281
I told you to walk away.

612
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:28,866
God damn it, Dexter.

613
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,870
There are consequences to
everything you do in life.

614
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:36,374
Lose control, become powerless,
and it's over.

615
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,586
- I found the grave, son.
- I'll be like this forever?

616
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,174
Mommy!

617
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,095
I have to get out of here.

618
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,598
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Whoa.
whoa. whoa. Sean, come here.

619
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:54,392
Sean, Sean. Sean!

620
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,494
Oh, my god.

621
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,292
Are you okay?

622
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,171
Stay.

623
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,756
Stay with me.

624
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,865
You're sweet.

625
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,161
I am?

626
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:22,081
Next time,
we'll figure out what to tell the kids

627
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,876
so you don't have to
sneak out like this.

628
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,464
You want there to
be a next time?

629
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,092
And a time after that.

630
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,471
Don't you?

631
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:45,563
No. I mean, yeah.

632
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,982
I just...

633
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,780
I didn't freak you out?

634
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,074
Why would you think that?

635
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:01,287
Dexter, there's nothing you could
ever do that would scare me away.

636
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,678
I really hope you
came to apologize.

637
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,181
Nope. I came for a consult.

638
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,266
And you brought beverages?

639
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,393
I got this on loan
from the morgue.

640
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,772
Now, I could use
an expert opinion,

641
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,982
specifically your
expert opinion.

642
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,777
See, we can't figure out

643
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:36,197
exactly how the killer
cut off this head.

644
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:39,867
- Can you?
- Nope.

645
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,077
Really?

646
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,287
I think you can.

647
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,373
I mean, you chop people up,
don't you?

648
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:48,668
- Maybe you need a closer look.
- No. Keep it away.

649
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,968
I talked to the
medical examiner.

650
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:59,262
He couldn't confirm
how your mom died.

651
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,264
Said it might have
been a heart attack.

652
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,975
- I killed her.
- You don't have the balls.

653
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,769
I mean, you had to wait till
she died to chop her up.

654
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:10,273
And even then you were too
squeamish to cut off her head.

655
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:14,193
Not exactly the same as
stuffing roadkill, is it?

656
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,070
Oh, fuck you.

657
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,073
?

658
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:22,285
Especially the ice-truck killer.
You know,

659
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:26,289
you're not the first groupie to take
credit for someone else's work.

660
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:27,081
Oh, bullshit.

661
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,291
?

662
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,168
things that weren't
published in the newspapers.

663
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,461
That's because you hacked
into our computer system.

664
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,256
? I had the I.T.
guys check our firewall.

665
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,884
The DMZ was breached.
You read all our police reports.

666
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:40,761
You even got yourself a nice
paneled car last month.

667
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,764
- Nice touch, by the way.
- Why are you doing this?

668
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,058
Because you're not a killer.

669
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,980
You're a coward and a fake,
aren't you?

670
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,278
- Maybe you need another look.

671
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,864
- No, take it away.

672
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,995
All right, I lied, okay?

673
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:11,459
Just, I need you to
take it away from me...

674
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:14,879
Please.

675
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:27,975
So, what's on your
mind, lieutenant?

676
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,061
We got a lot to get done
before Perry's trial.

677
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:33,773
Yeah, about that trial --
I've got some bad news.

678
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,193
Perry recanted his
confession this morning.

679
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,861
What are you talking about?

680
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:41,572
I was going over some
details with him at county,

681
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,866
and he admitted that he
gave us a false confession.

682
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,786
He's a wannabe, Tom.

683
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,163
Just wanted his 15 minutes,
that's all.

684
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,666
How do you know which
time he was lying?

685
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,670
All due respect, Maria,
if we dropped charges

686
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,381
every time someone
recanted his confession,

687
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,966
our jails would be empty.

688
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:01,968
We're going to trial.

689
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,263
All due respect, Captain,
that's really not up to you.

690
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,474
It's up to the D.A.

691
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,268
I understand your
frustration, Maria,

692
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,479
but I reviewed the D.A.
work sheets.

693
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,981
The evidence is compelling.

694
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,483
We'll move forward with
the trial as planned.

695
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,490
Fair enough.

696
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,868
If that's what you two want,
I'm fully behind it.

697
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,163
I was really worried about you.
You sure you're all right?

698
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,081
I kept calling your house,

699
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:33,874
but I think the number
you gave me didn't work.

700
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,584
You wouldn't have
reached me anyway,

701
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,962
'cause I was at
my girlfriend's.

702
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,674
I spent the
night,

703
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,176
face-to-face.

704
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:48,097
- Sean, that's very good.

705
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,890
It's all good, doctor.

706
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,686
I even stopped worrying about that
friend of mine who's been out of touch.

707
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:55,896
You can't control other people,
you know?

708
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,482
This is a real breakthrough.
You should be proud of yourself.

709
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,360
I am proud.

710
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:11,162
Truth be told, I never expected
to make progress in therapy.

711
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,456
That's not true.
If that were true,

712
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:15,458
you never would have come
in here in the first place.

713
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,880
What do you want
to focus on today?

714
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,965
Glad you asked that.

715
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,890
I'm gonna tell you something

716
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:35,061
- that I've never told anyone before.
- Okay.

717
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,689
I'm a serial killer.

718
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:44,779
Oh, god.

719
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,366
Oh, that feels

720
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,660
so amazing to say out loud.

721
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,996
Well, you must be letting go,

722
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,790
because I've never heard
you make a joke before.

723
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,792
I'm not joking. I kill people.

724
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,379
Whew! There it is again.

725
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,884
You should try it.

726
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:08,969
I know.

727
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:13,057
Your big, bad wolf has racked
up a tidy little death toll.

728
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:16,769
I'm just kidding.

729
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:19,688
I disabled the cameras,
and I copied the files.

730
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,357
I don't know what
you're talking about.

731
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,567
Then focus on your breathing,
maybe you'll remember --

732
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:27,488
- Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.
- Those sessions are confidential.

733
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,490
I'm a control freak, I know.

734
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,992
But I watched your home movies.
It's amazing stuff --

735
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,370
drugs, guns,
and a crazy psychiatrist.

736
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,456
No wonder you're so well
versed in control issues.

737
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,875
You got quite the God complex.

738
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:41,877
This session's over.

739
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,681
Not so fast, doc.

740
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,577
You're awake.

741
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:17,163
Shall we analyze your dreams?

742
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,292
No. That's right.

743
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,669
You've already told me
everything I need to know,

744
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,381
except why powerful women?

745
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:31,969
You took powerful women
and made them powerless.

746
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,556
They left behind
families, children.

747
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:47,776
I have to confess,
I'm a little conflicted.

748
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:50,696
You've helped me make
a major self-discovery.

749
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,493
The fact that I'm a killer...

750
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,676
..that's something
I can't control.

751
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,270
You helped me to accept
what I really am.

752
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,858
I'm grateful for that. But...

753
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:32,571
I was raised with a
certain set of principles.

754
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:40,663
I'm sorry, doc. Actions have
consequences, and this is yours.

755
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,375
I'm gonna have to let you go.

756
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:52,174
* Jennifer's got daddy's car *

757
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:56,679
* she's playin' "uptown"
on the stereo *

758
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,181
* we go cruisin' so close *

759
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:04,562
* the way they did long ago *

760
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,397
* my darlin' *

761
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:10,776
* turn the radio up
for that sweet sound *

762
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:15,072
* hold me close,
never let me go *

763
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:19,660
* keep this feelin' alive,
make me lose control *

764
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,997
- Hello?
- Is that Eric Carmen?

765
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,294
No. What's up?

766
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,587
I'm running late.
I'm in the middle of some housework.

767
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:33,173
If I don't get it done,
it's gonna drive me crazy.

768
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:37,094
- I never knew you were so anal.
- And I'm a neat freak.

769
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,388
You're just full
of surprises, huh?

770
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:42,683
Oh, you have no idea.

771
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,685
I'll be there as
soon as I can, okay?

772
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,061
Okay.

773
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:10,085
Barbie, be patient.

774
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,297
One day we'll share a cold one. Ken.
