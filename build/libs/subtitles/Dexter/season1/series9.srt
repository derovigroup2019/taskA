1
00:01:47,847 --> 00:01:49,585
<i>Previously on "Dexter"...</i>

2
00:01:49,722 --> 00:01:52,215
<i>What if the ice-truck
killer does disappear?</i>

3
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:55,904
<i>No, he's got unfinished
business with me.</i>

4
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,062
<i>"Dear Ken, I'm in pieces.</i>

5
00:01:58,199 --> 00:02:00,974
<i>Why the cold shoulder?
Love, Barbie."</i>

6
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:03,199
Paul called after you left.

7
00:02:03,336 --> 00:02:05,300
He's already out of jail --
Overcrowding.

8
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,310
Can you believe it?

9
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:07,890
Are you fucking my wife?

10
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:11,697
Next time, we'll figure out
what to tell the kids

11
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:14,745
so you don't have to
sneak out like this.

12
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:16,706
You want there to
be a next time?

13
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:18,293
I just wish he'd go away.

14
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:20,923
Why can't he just go away
and disappear forever?

15
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:22,481
I so want to
maul you right now.

16
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:24,030
I so want you to.

17
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:25,781
It's different.

18
00:02:26,717 --> 00:02:28,931
It feels like...

19
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,953
I hate saying this.
It sounds fucking cheesy.

20
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:36,870
It feels like making love.

21
00:02:38,678 --> 00:02:41,020
"Barbie, be patient.

22
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:43,741
"One day we'll
share a cold one."

23
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:10,133
<i>Thank god for showers.
Private time to think --</i>

24
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:13,563
<i>Harder to come by now that
I'm in a real relationship.</i>

25
00:03:15,508 --> 00:03:17,202
Do you mind?

26
00:03:17,307 --> 00:03:19,103
Not at all.

27
00:03:20,797 --> 00:03:24,323
- Could you pass the soap?
- Yeah.

28
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:31,090
It's locked!

29
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:35,422
Mom, I got to pee!

30
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,860
I'll be right
there, sweetie!

31
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:40,302
- Hold on a second, buddy!
- I can't!

32
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,550
Sorry.
One-bathroom house.

33
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,430
Nature calls.

34
00:03:47,118 --> 00:03:49,822
Cool. How did you
get that ugly scar?

35
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:50,712
Cody!

36
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:53,413
Sword fight -- I won.

37
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,923
Mom, I got to brush.

38
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,450
Whatever happened to knocking?

39
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:00,423
I'm gonna be late for school.

40
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:02,643
You brush, you pee,
I'm just gonna...

41
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,450
Wow, big scar.

42
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:09,652
Sword fight --
He won.

43
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:16,810
I mean, what does "separation"
mean to you?

44
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:19,342
What "separation" means to
me is that you're separated,

45
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:23,033
and you work it out.
Now, this was false pretenses.

46
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,913
I mean,
I knew she wanted a divorce

47
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:27,023
when she asked for the
separation -- she lied.

48
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,420
Yeah, and you didn't when you
were cheating on her, right?

49
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,673
- "Cheat" -- One cheat.
- Got it.

50
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:31,892
That's in the singular.

51
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:32,870
- One.
- Okay.

52
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:35,051
And I felt so crappy,
I told her the next day.

53
00:04:35,095 --> 00:04:36,700
That's your problem.
You're too damn honest.

54
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:38,200
She wouldn't even
talk about it.

55
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,003
And I tried to get her to
see a counselor with me.

56
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:41,140
Forget that.

57
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:42,251
- Stop the car, man!
- What?

58
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:43,633
Stop the goddamn car!

59
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,481
Stop! Police!

60
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:24,221
Doakes! Doakes!

61
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:35,821
- You all right?
- Yeah.

62
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:13,842
The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard,
according to his driver's license.

63
00:06:13,935 --> 00:06:16,653
- Haitian?
- That'd be my guess.

64
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:19,142
All right.
Let's go over it again.

65
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:21,311
I saw a gun in the
suspect's waistband.

66
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:24,022
I went to question him, and
he took off running when he saw me.

67
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:26,442
Angel, you saw all this?

68
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,172
Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt,

69
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:30,313
and I turned the car
around in pursuit.

70
00:06:30,465 --> 00:06:32,722
All right, and when you went
under the causeway...

71
00:06:32,756 --> 00:06:34,362
He took a shot at me.

72
00:06:34,505 --> 00:06:37,513
I took cover and returned
fire from that corner.

73
00:06:37,557 --> 00:06:39,322
No, not from there.

74
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,823
Yeah, from fucking right there.

75
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,420
But...

76
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:47,280
If you shot him
from right there,

77
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:50,221
the blood spatter would go in that
direction. Look at the patterns.

78
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:52,420
You questioning me?
'Cause I got questions for you.

79
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:54,180
The man's just doing what
he's supposed to do.

80
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,500
The man is
a fucking creep job!

81
00:06:55,526 --> 00:06:57,703
James. Just focus
on the facts, okay?

82
00:06:58,347 --> 00:07:00,643
The D.A.'s team is ready for you.
You good?

83
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:01,900
I'm good.

84
00:07:03,018 --> 00:07:05,692
Yeah.
You're up next.

85
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:13,092
Sorry, but I didn't
invent physics.

86
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:14,802
He just got
mixed up is all.

87
00:07:15,257 --> 00:07:17,551
Hell, I'm not even sure
what the hell happened.

88
00:07:18,258 --> 00:07:20,930
Trauma can distort the memory.

89
00:07:35,107 --> 00:07:37,501
Come on. I want you and
Rita to meet my boyfriend.

90
00:07:37,536 --> 00:07:39,600
It's just hard to get a
babysitter on a Friday night.

91
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:42,053
Dex, you're my brother.
You should know my boyfriend.

92
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:44,383
You really like using
the "B" word, don't you?

93
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:46,303
Well, Rudy is my
goddamn boyfriend,

94
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:48,053
so stop making
bullshit excuses.

95
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:50,801
Honestly, our last double
date was a little awkward.

96
00:07:51,258 --> 00:07:54,750
I just want to make sure
this one's gonna... stick.

97
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:57,200
Well, thanks for the vote
of fucking confidence!

98
00:07:57,426 --> 00:07:59,502
Dex, Rudy's different.

99
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:02,443
I feel safe with him.
I think...

100
00:08:02,905 --> 00:08:04,641
I'm falling for him.

101
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:07,130
Excuse me.
Where can I find Dexter Morgan?

102
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:08,781
Right here.

103
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:10,330
Oh, that was easy.

104
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:15,073
An urgent registered letter?

105
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:17,000
Maybe you won a sweepstakes.

106
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:19,813
- Dex, you got a second?
- Yeah.

107
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:25,963
Hey, you finish your
report on the shooting?

108
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:27,980
I'm walking it up to I.A.
right now.

109
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:30,562
You still think Doakes'
version doesn't add up?

110
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:32,790
Blood never lies.

111
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,642
Shit.

112
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:37,503
Listen, um...

113
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:39,570
Can you sit on that
till I talk to Doakes?

114
00:08:40,456 --> 00:08:42,581
Here.

115
00:08:42,687 --> 00:08:44,921
Now it's yours to sit on,
stand on, do what you want.

116
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,130
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

117
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,252
You know, it's a federal offense
to read someone else's mail.

118
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,151
"We regret to inform you of
the death of your father"?

119
00:08:56,107 --> 00:08:57,971
Dad died 10 years ago.

120
00:08:58,106 --> 00:08:59,660
This isn't about Harry.

121
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:02,210
"Joseph Driscoll of Dade City,
Florida, names his son,

122
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:04,240
"Dexter Morgan of Miami,

123
00:09:04,248 --> 00:09:06,243
"as his executor."

124
00:09:06,437 --> 00:09:07,601
It's a will.

125
00:09:07,658 --> 00:09:09,122
Well, he can't be your
biological father.

126
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,902
Dad said he died before
you came to live with us.

127
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:12,653
He wouldn't make a
mistake like that.

128
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:16,243
"The body's awaiting cremation
while they notify the next of kin."

129
00:09:16,276 --> 00:09:17,980
I'm your only next of kin.

130
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:19,710
Don't you fucking forget it.

131
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,083
Oh, and I inherited a house.

132
00:09:25,128 --> 00:09:26,383
<i>I know the truth,</i>

133
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:28,202
<i>because Harry always
told me the truth.</i>

134
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:29,360
<i>He had to.</i>

135
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:31,341
<i>He was teaching me
principles, a code.</i>

136
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,581
<i>He knew what I would
become without it.</i>

137
00:09:34,097 --> 00:09:37,763
<i>So Joseph Driscoll of Dade
City must have been mistaken.</i>

138
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:40,850
You know what this is?

139
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:43,690
This is Dexter's new
birth certificate.

140
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:47,012
The adoption finally
went through.

141
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:48,653
You're a Morgan now.

142
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:50,440
I thought I was
already a Morgan.

143
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:53,397
Well, you have been to us,
but it's official now.

144
00:09:55,236 --> 00:09:57,685
It took a long time
and a lot of hurdles.

145
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,116
- This is an important day for us.
- Hey, dad?

146
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:05,142
How come you never told us what
happened to Dexter's real parents?

147
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:06,801
Well, they died.

148
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:08,702
I know,
but how?

149
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:11,382
- I don't know.
- Let's not talk about it.

150
00:10:11,617 --> 00:10:14,242
No, how did they die, dad?

151
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:16,823
It was an accident,
a tragic accident.

152
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:23,890
So, have you found out anything
else about this Joe Driscoll?

153
00:10:24,217 --> 00:10:26,943
Well, I looked online. I even --

154
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:30,043
looked at police records.
There are no birth records,

155
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:33,000
no driver's license,
just the deed to the house...

156
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:37,120
And a mention in the local
paper about his bowling team.

157
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:38,370
That's odd.

158
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,400
Yeah, I spoke to
the probate lawyer,

159
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:42,020
the guy who drafted the will.

160
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:46,782
And apparently Joseph Driscoll was
an insurance adjuster of sound mind,

161
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:51,293
with no doubts about who I was.

162
00:10:53,098 --> 00:10:56,391
Dexter, you're not feeling
any of this, are you?

163
00:10:56,577 --> 00:11:00,431
You're obviously so overwhelmed
that you've shut down.

164
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:05,861
Maybe.

165
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,791
It's too much for
you to handle.

166
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:12,471
Yeah. I guess.

167
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:14,963
So I think I should
come with you.

168
00:11:15,997 --> 00:11:17,800
Oh, no,
you don't have to do that.

169
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:21,091
Trust me. You'll need me.

170
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:53,572
I fell asleep.

171
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:59,390
Sex like that takes a
lot out of a person.

172
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:10,060
So, are we still seeing your
brother for dinner Friday night?

173
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:11,071
No.

174
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:13,302
He's got to go to Dade City.

175
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:15,303
What's in Dade City?

176
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:18,113
- I told you he was adopted, right?
- Yeah.

177
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:20,702
Some dead guy up in Dade
fucking City thought he was

178
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:22,883
Dexter's biological father

179
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:24,963
and left him a house.

180
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,251
Really?

181
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:31,991
Man.

182
00:12:34,026 --> 00:12:37,172
It's a mistake,
a big one.

183
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:39,230
Still, though, that's got to...

184
00:12:39,887 --> 00:12:42,230
open up some old wounds.

185
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:47,161
When are you leaving?

186
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:48,282
Me?

187
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:51,362
I'm gonna stay in bed
with you all weekend.

188
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,331
I thought you two were close.

189
00:12:54,516 --> 00:12:55,852
We are.

190
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:59,501
Dex just likes to deal
with things on his own.

191
00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:01,782
- He doesn't need my help.
- Or...

192
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:06,543
He doesn't know
how to ask for it.

193
00:13:15,147 --> 00:13:18,292
I left a message so we wouldn't
have to have this conversation.

194
00:13:18,368 --> 00:13:20,340
Yeah, which is why
I hustled over here,

195
00:13:20,378 --> 00:13:21,960
so we could hash this
out like adults.

196
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:24,791
Admirable, Paul, but this adult
is still going out of town.

197
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:28,612
Not if it means blowing off my
scheduled visit with my kids.

198
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:30,343
That's not your call.

199
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:32,270
The kids are already
settled at Colleen's.

200
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:34,350
You can have your
visit when we get back.

201
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:44,871
It's just that I already laid
out cash for the tickets.

202
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:49,200
A death in the family
trumps the circus.

203
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:51,322
Dexter is not your family.
I am.

204
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:56,200
You ready?

205
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,581
Hey, Paul.

206
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:01,450
Better hit the road.

207
00:14:36,486 --> 00:14:39,380
They should have served a
cardiologist with these burgers.

208
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:40,553
We had to eat them.

209
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:42,901
Junk food's the unwritten
rule of the road.

210
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:44,913
It's nice.

211
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:48,902
The lawyer said there should
be a key under the mat.

212
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:55,570
Are you my new neighbors?!

213
00:14:56,635 --> 00:14:57,452
No.

214
00:14:57,616 --> 00:15:00,443
No, we're just here to clear up
some things with the estate.

215
00:15:00,477 --> 00:15:02,543
So sad about Mr. Driscoll.

216
00:15:02,957 --> 00:15:06,390
He was only 60, you know --
Too young for a heart attack.

217
00:15:06,578 --> 00:15:08,921
He used to clean my
gutters every fall.

218
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:12,303
I don't know what
I'm gonna do now...

219
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:15,640
Unless you know how
to clean gutters.

220
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,953
We're not gonna be
here for that long.

221
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:21,543
But, uh, you have a good day.

222
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:43,180
A bachelor lived here,
that's for sure.

223
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:48,601
Well, we can head back
tomorrow morning,

224
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:51,061
as soon as I straighten
things out at the morgue.

225
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:53,502
I don't want a
house in Dade City.

226
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,223
Which means it's gonna
need to be packed up.

227
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:59,652
And I don't think anybody
else is gonna do it, so

228
00:15:59,847 --> 00:16:01,861
I guess that leaves us.

229
00:16:03,268 --> 00:16:05,373
Told you you'd need me.

230
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:33,363
- Hey, James.
- Hey, man.

231
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:37,201
I.A. is pressing me on my
report of the shooting.

232
00:16:37,256 --> 00:16:38,202
Yeah.

233
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:41,092
There's just one thing
that I can't get clear on.

234
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:43,432
It's pretty clear from
where I was standing.

235
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,470
Yeah...

236
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:46,850
Except...

237
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:49,073
I could have sworn that I
heard your 9-millimeter go off

238
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:50,823
before the .38.

239
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:54,671
Now, there's lots of reasons it
could have gone down that way.

240
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:57,581
If Bayard even
just aimed at you,

241
00:16:57,646 --> 00:16:59,481
it's still all right to shoot.

242
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:01,291
Except he shot first,
when I came around the corner.

243
00:17:01,347 --> 00:17:02,803
Yeah. Maybe you're
confused about that too

244
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:04,200
because the
blood-spatter report says

245
00:17:04,245 --> 00:17:06,503
- it couldn't have gone down that way.
- You saying I'm a liar?

246
00:17:06,548 --> 00:17:09,012
No. I'm saying that maybe
you're not remembering right.

247
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,502
This may come as a fucking
shock to you, Angel,

248
00:17:11,808 --> 00:17:14,402
but you're not the only
honest cop in Miami.

249
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:18,141
Look, I just want to know

250
00:17:18,178 --> 00:17:19,700
why a man is dead.

251
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:22,120
You want to come at me,
you come at me straight.

252
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:24,901
You want it straight?
I did not see a gun!

253
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:27,202
A ngel.

254
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:29,251
I need to talk to you.

255
00:17:30,797 --> 00:17:32,583
Help me out, man.

256
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:49,342
- Is that Joe?
- Must be.

257
00:17:53,595 --> 00:17:57,310
It's weird,
but he looks a little bit like you...

258
00:17:57,485 --> 00:17:59,021
But not really.

259
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:01,932
Those seem to be the only
pictures in the house.

260
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:07,012
There's no family
or kids' photos.

261
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:09,201
Lonely.

262
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:20,721
- Dexter. Hi.
- Hey.

263
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:21,893
Surprise.

264
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:28,271
I know you can't
ask for my help, but

265
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:30,710
it's my duty to, you know...

266
00:18:32,097 --> 00:18:35,861
Help while you deal
with old wounds...

267
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:38,533
Or wha-- Jesus.
Whatever. I'm here.

268
00:18:38,606 --> 00:18:39,700
So it appears.

269
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:42,231
And this is Rudy.

270
00:18:46,545 --> 00:18:49,221
I've waited a long
time to meet you.

271
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:52,433
And you must be Rita.

272
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:54,592
Hi.

273
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:58,951
He came here for me --
For the both of us.

274
00:18:59,698 --> 00:19:01,001
Isn't he great?

275
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,852
A lot of work to
pack all this up.

276
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,853
Even with the four of us,
it'll take us the whole weekend.

277
00:19:14,865 --> 00:19:17,260
The whole weekend?
Where should I put our stuff?

278
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:22,201
It's too eerie,
sleeping in a dead man's house.

279
00:19:22,348 --> 00:19:24,313
I saw a Motel 6 on the way in.

280
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,610
We could stay here
and save the money.

281
00:19:26,797 --> 00:19:28,150
I mean, it is late,

282
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:30,502
and we'd probably get more
packing done if we stayed here.

283
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:32,553
It's up to you, Dex.

284
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:34,233
Just say the word.

285
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:38,593
As long as you don't
mind the sofa bed.

286
00:19:40,118 --> 00:19:42,613
Okay, I'll go look
for some clean sheets.

287
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:53,623
<i>How did a death turn
into a couples' weekend?</i>

288
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:02,591
<i>Luckily, I get up earlier
than normal people.</i>

289
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,451
Coffee?

290
00:20:07,227 --> 00:20:08,572
Thanks.

291
00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:10,561
I've got to hit the morgue.

292
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:15,022
Want company?

293
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:17,650
No.

294
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:21,772
- Thank you, though.
- It's private.

295
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:23,590
I get it.

296
00:20:34,146 --> 00:20:36,853
I gave Joe a physical once a year,
like clockwork,

297
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:39,930
so no history of heart disease,
but it happens.

298
00:20:40,076 --> 00:20:41,191
It appears so.

299
00:20:41,326 --> 00:20:44,022
We were about to send him to a
crematorium when we found you.

300
00:20:44,106 --> 00:20:45,850
We thought

301
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:48,931
his son should have a chance
to pay his last respects.

302
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:50,473
I'm not his son.

303
00:20:51,306 --> 00:20:53,933
Estrangement in a
family is a shame, but

304
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:56,881
death is the great unifier.

305
00:21:35,788 --> 00:21:38,312
That's an interesting tattoo.

306
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:41,010
Joe said he picked
that up in Nam.

307
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,400
You can be proud.
He was a patriot.

308
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:46,222
Uh, perhaps he was
also an ex-convict.

309
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,470
- Excuse me?
- It's a prison tattoo.

310
00:21:48,656 --> 00:21:50,602
It's done with a pen
and ballpoint ink.

311
00:21:51,178 --> 00:21:54,650
It's three or four decades old,
judging by the fade.

312
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,161
Son, I knew Joe. He
was no ex-convict.

313
00:21:57,165 --> 00:21:59,180
He was a good man,

314
00:21:59,307 --> 00:22:00,470
a quiet man,

315
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:03,722
and a damn good bowler.

316
00:22:05,606 --> 00:22:07,350
How'd you determine
cardiac arrest?

317
00:22:07,478 --> 00:22:09,760
Was there damage to
the coronary artery?

318
00:22:10,826 --> 00:22:12,840
It's, uh,
professional curiosity.

319
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:14,820
I work in forensics,
down in Miami.

320
00:22:15,118 --> 00:22:16,090
I see.

321
00:22:16,646 --> 00:22:21,442
Well, uh, I found microaneurisms
in the retinas.

322
00:22:21,638 --> 00:22:24,451
It's common with seizures
during a heart attack.

323
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:27,172
It's also a sign of
diabetic retinopathy.

324
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:30,743
Son, I may be a
small-town doctor,

325
00:22:30,786 --> 00:22:33,031
but I know a heart
attack when I see one.

326
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:37,203
Who knows what caused it --

327
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:38,602
Stress,

328
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:40,562
inactivity...

329
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,921
French fries --

330
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:46,871
But knowing won't
bring him back.

331
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:03,863
It's hard to accept so many unanswered
questions, but sometimes...

332
00:23:04,246 --> 00:23:06,550
No, you're right...

333
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,652
Dr. Pittman.

334
00:23:09,578 --> 00:23:11,830
Yeah, this is really hard.

335
00:23:13,905 --> 00:23:16,493
You mind if I just take
a minute alone with...

336
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:18,702
Dad?

337
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:22,721
I'll be next door in my office.

338
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:52,263
Masuka.

339
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:53,712
Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.

340
00:23:53,907 --> 00:23:56,242
Dude, I know
your last name.

341
00:23:56,445 --> 00:23:58,980
I need a favor,
a DNA comparison.

342
00:23:59,126 --> 00:24:01,320
I thought you were away
with the girlfriend.

343
00:24:01,428 --> 00:24:03,170
What? She surfing
the Crimson wave?

344
00:24:03,248 --> 00:24:05,120
I'm just helping
out a local agency.

345
00:24:05,818 --> 00:24:08,492
I'm gonna send you
two blood samples.

346
00:24:08,556 --> 00:24:10,172
I need it A.S.A.P.

347
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:11,843
Do a tox
screen, will you?

348
00:24:11,877 --> 00:24:14,983
Hey, Romeo, if this is your
idea of a romantic weekend,

349
00:24:15,116 --> 00:24:17,480
you're gonna be a bachelor
for a very long time.

350
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:18,203
Yeah.

351
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:30,363
Run another I.V.
Let's keep his blood levels volumized.

352
00:24:30,506 --> 00:24:32,051
What's his pressure?

353
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:33,611
It's 80 and dropping.

354
00:24:33,747 --> 00:24:36,120
We may need to
do a belly tap.

355
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:38,500
Hey, Dex.
Buddy, I'm here.

356
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,370
- It hurts, dad.
- What happened?

357
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:43,102
He tried to climb a fence
to get Debra's ball,

358
00:24:43,156 --> 00:24:44,900
but a dog chased after him,

359
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:46,903
and he fell on a
wrought-iron post.

360
00:24:46,957 --> 00:24:48,253
Is he gonna be all right?

361
00:24:48,598 --> 00:24:50,193
We can keep him
stable for a while.

362
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:52,943
But he's gonna need surgery to
repair some internal bleeding,

363
00:24:52,976 --> 00:24:53,972
and that's a problem.

364
00:24:54,005 --> 00:24:55,703
Can we talk over
here, please?

365
00:24:55,757 --> 00:24:57,343
Dex, I'll be right back.

366
00:24:57,488 --> 00:24:59,680
Hold your brother's
hand, sweetie.

367
00:25:00,658 --> 00:25:03,762
Okay, the complication is
with your son's blood type.

368
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:05,350
I don't want to
talk about this.

369
00:25:05,385 --> 00:25:06,961
Why are you being like this?!

370
00:25:06,998 --> 00:25:09,350
You don't need to mention
that in front of anybody.

371
00:25:09,387 --> 00:25:11,002
Are you crazy?!
He could die.

372
00:25:11,047 --> 00:25:13,240
You got to do something quick.
You've got to go now.

373
00:25:17,707 --> 00:25:19,563
So, you heard the .38 go off

374
00:25:19,595 --> 00:25:21,441
before sergeant
Doakes' 9-millimeter.

375
00:25:21,638 --> 00:25:24,042
Then I went under the causeway,
and I saw the suspect...

376
00:25:24,075 --> 00:25:25,382
Mr. Bayard...

377
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:28,200
Mr. Bayard on the ground,

378
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,312
his gun lying next to him.

379
00:25:30,456 --> 00:25:32,452
And you're sure it was
Mr. Bayard's gun?

380
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,671
Well, the .38 wasn't mine.

381
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,252
And Sergeant Doakes had
his niner in his hands.

382
00:25:37,297 --> 00:25:38,902
Did you see Mr. Bayard
carrying the gun

383
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:40,693
before the foot
chase began?

384
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,550
Sergeant Doakes did.

385
00:25:42,686 --> 00:25:44,830
Did you see Mr. Bayard
acting suspiciously?

386
00:25:46,607 --> 00:25:48,803
Did you know Mr. Bayard
worked as a janitor?

387
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:50,000
I --

388
00:25:50,405 --> 00:25:52,193
How the fuck
would I know that?

389
00:25:52,226 --> 00:25:53,900
Never got so much
as a parking ticket

390
00:25:53,948 --> 00:25:56,630
since he immigrated from
Haiti 15 years ago.

391
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:02,273
He got a lot more than
that this time, didn't he?

392
00:26:08,606 --> 00:26:10,750
Are you sure you
heard the .38 go off

393
00:26:10,807 --> 00:26:13,090
before Sergeant
Doakes' 9-millimeter?

394
00:26:23,325 --> 00:26:26,471
Joe bought this house
outright in 1976,

395
00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:28,003
paid cash,

396
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:29,600
no records before that.

397
00:26:29,646 --> 00:26:30,902
No records,

398
00:26:30,948 --> 00:26:32,931
no childhood photos...

399
00:26:33,308 --> 00:26:34,661
The guy was 60,

400
00:26:34,855 --> 00:26:37,151
but it's like his life
started when he was 30.

401
00:26:37,198 --> 00:26:38,602
You know, you're right.

402
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:40,062
He's right.

403
00:26:40,106 --> 00:26:42,780
So, what happened
between years one and 29?

404
00:26:42,826 --> 00:26:45,401
Maybe he butchered
his entire family.

405
00:26:45,455 --> 00:26:46,303
Yeah...

406
00:26:46,506 --> 00:26:48,302
Or he walked out
on his two wives

407
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,972
and a lot of bad debt.

408
00:26:50,017 --> 00:26:51,401
The guy was a loser, after all.

409
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:53,691
Who else owns this
many bowling balls?

410
00:26:53,897 --> 00:26:55,530
What do you think, Dex?

411
00:26:56,278 --> 00:26:59,801
I think Joe spent
some time in prison,

412
00:27:00,176 --> 00:27:02,473
probably mixed with
some bad people.

413
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:04,483
Maybe he had to hide from them.

414
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,733
Whatever it was,
drugs were involved --

415
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,700
Narcotics anonymous.

416
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,003
Paul used to get these,

417
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:12,492
except he never made it
past the welcome chip.

418
00:27:12,806 --> 00:27:15,250
Looks like Joe
was clean for...

419
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:16,901
Let me guess --
30 years.

420
00:27:17,008 --> 00:27:18,421
Well, Joe said
no to the drugs,

421
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:19,832
but not his rock 'n' roll.

422
00:27:19,868 --> 00:27:22,472
Nothing in his
collection post-1980.

423
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:24,801
Got to love a purist.

424
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:43,982
Oh, good.
Dancing.

425
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:39,451
- Hello?
- Hey, babe. It's Paul.

426
00:28:41,906 --> 00:28:44,431
Just making sure dear Dexter

427
00:28:44,576 --> 00:28:47,373
is dealing decently
with his dead dad.

428
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:50,701
We're fine.

429
00:28:50,805 --> 00:28:52,671
Everyone's fine, OK?

430
00:28:52,817 --> 00:28:55,112
- We'll see you on Monday.
- No, no, no.

431
00:28:55,158 --> 00:28:56,252
Talk to me.

432
00:28:56,356 --> 00:28:57,900
You having fun?

433
00:28:58,505 --> 00:28:59,800
'Cause I'm not.

434
00:28:59,957 --> 00:29:01,782
- Paul.
- I would have.

435
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:05,373
I could have taken my
kids to the circus.

436
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:09,032
We'd be eating
peanuts right now,

437
00:29:09,217 --> 00:29:11,193
stepping in elephant shit.

438
00:29:11,377 --> 00:29:13,773
Paul, this is not helping
my confidence in you.

439
00:29:13,956 --> 00:29:17,350
Oh, I think you've got enough
confidence for both of us.

440
00:29:17,457 --> 00:29:18,801
Look, if you want to work

441
00:29:18,846 --> 00:29:20,852
towards building more
visitation days, not less,

442
00:29:20,905 --> 00:29:23,200
you need to avoid this kind
of behavior right here.

443
00:29:27,897 --> 00:29:30,070
Now, I think you
might just want

444
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:31,753
to politely hang up.

445
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:37,671
Okay.

446
00:29:39,525 --> 00:29:40,273
You're right.

447
00:29:41,517 --> 00:29:42,401
I'm sorry.

448
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:46,221
You have a great weekend.

449
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,962
<i>A secret life --</i>

450
00:29:59,106 --> 00:30:01,411
<i>The only thing Joe
and I have in common.</i>

451
00:30:02,106 --> 00:30:04,640
<i>There's nothing else in
this house to connect us.</i>

452
00:30:05,338 --> 00:30:06,611
Hiding out?

453
00:30:09,446 --> 00:30:10,663
Cleaning up.

454
00:30:14,427 --> 00:30:17,243
I can only imagine what
you're going through.

455
00:30:17,847 --> 00:30:19,921
A lot of
lemon-fresh joy.

456
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:21,913
You joke.

457
00:30:22,175 --> 00:30:24,003
It's good defense,
by the way.

458
00:30:24,016 --> 00:30:25,842
Thank you.
I think.

459
00:30:25,885 --> 00:30:27,193
Still,

460
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,870
the possibility has got
to be weighing on you.

461
00:30:29,946 --> 00:30:31,513
What possibility?

462
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:33,101
That Joe

463
00:30:33,225 --> 00:30:35,051
could actually
be your dad.

464
00:30:35,107 --> 00:30:36,602
The only way
that's a possibility

465
00:30:36,647 --> 00:30:39,200
is if Harry was wrong.
And, uh,

466
00:30:39,356 --> 00:30:41,700
that's just not possible.

467
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:44,620
Or he lied.

468
00:30:46,885 --> 00:30:49,833
Don't you worry, little man.
You're not gonna feel a thing.

469
00:30:49,878 --> 00:30:52,740
I thought there was a problem --
you know, the blood?

470
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,041
Your dad fixed it.

471
00:30:54,235 --> 00:30:57,663
See, you have a very special
blood type -- A.B. negative.

472
00:30:57,807 --> 00:30:59,972
It's hard to come by,
and our supply was low.

473
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:02,311
But your dad knew somebody
with blood just like yours.

474
00:31:02,346 --> 00:31:03,750
You're very lucky.

475
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,031
- Can I have a moment with my son?
- Yeah.

476
00:31:06,305 --> 00:31:07,501
Hey, Dex.

477
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,432
Everything's gonna be fine.

478
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:11,201
You'll be good as new.

479
00:31:11,235 --> 00:31:12,600
I will?

480
00:31:12,755 --> 00:31:14,351
Hey, would
I lie to you?

481
00:31:19,105 --> 00:31:21,101
When my father was dying,

482
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:23,422
he just asked me
for one thing --

483
00:31:23,688 --> 00:31:26,932
Deber?a ser
un hombre honesto.

484
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:31,761
"Be an honest man."

485
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:37,143
That's all he asked.

486
00:31:39,636 --> 00:31:41,682
I made him that promise,

487
00:31:41,688 --> 00:31:43,730
and that's why I'm a cop.

488
00:31:47,938 --> 00:31:50,240
Now this Haitian
man is dead,

489
00:31:50,845 --> 00:31:52,541
and I don't know why,

490
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:56,012
but I know it ain't right.

491
00:31:58,966 --> 00:32:01,271
But if I talk...

492
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:04,371
I'll be a rat to
the whole precinct.

493
00:32:05,337 --> 00:32:08,151
- But if I lie --
- Hold up.

494
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:19,903
Go ahead.

495
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:38,303
The blood spatter doesn't
match Doakes' report.

496
00:32:42,218 --> 00:32:43,103
Also...

497
00:32:47,357 --> 00:32:51,211
...I heard Doakes' 9-millimeter
go off before the .38.

498
00:32:51,895 --> 00:32:55,091
- But he must have had good cause.
- So Doakes fired first?

499
00:33:01,425 --> 00:33:03,063
Doakes fired first.

500
00:33:14,997 --> 00:33:16,861
I hope tuna's all right.

501
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:18,881
Mmm, love me a little mercury.

502
00:33:20,317 --> 00:33:21,601
That's Dexter's.

503
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:24,212
Oh, he's out stealing garbage-can
space from the neighbors.

504
00:33:24,246 --> 00:33:26,070
Criminal -- I like it.

505
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:27,633
It's the station.

506
00:33:28,577 --> 00:33:30,212
Morgan here.

507
00:33:31,257 --> 00:33:32,300
Wait.

508
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:34,650
Did I call the hot
Morgan by mistake?

509
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:36,521
Freudian.

510
00:33:36,705 --> 00:33:39,540
My subconscious
has been exposed.

511
00:33:39,578 --> 00:33:41,850
Well, zip it up and tell
me what's going on.

512
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,042
I got the results.

513
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,813
On Doakes' shooting?
Has he been cleared?

514
00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:46,402
On the DNA test.

515
00:33:47,507 --> 00:33:48,801
What DNA test?

516
00:34:09,207 --> 00:34:10,850
You trusted dad
your entire life,

517
00:34:10,905 --> 00:34:12,802
so why question him now?

518
00:34:15,306 --> 00:34:17,003
Am I missing something?

519
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:21,002
DNA test?

520
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:24,003
Masuka called?

521
00:34:24,058 --> 00:34:26,300
Your biological
father was dead.

522
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:27,551
Dad told us that.

523
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,752
I remember.

524
00:34:28,855 --> 00:34:31,102
So, the DNA came back negative?

525
00:34:33,228 --> 00:34:34,903
It was a match.

526
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,703
Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

527
00:34:51,225 --> 00:34:52,390
Interesting.

528
00:34:54,796 --> 00:34:56,953
Do you think dad...

529
00:34:57,507 --> 00:34:58,752
lied?

530
00:35:00,117 --> 00:35:02,331
I think he might have
known Joe was here...

531
00:35:04,177 --> 00:35:06,953
...Five hours up
I-95 my whole life.

532
00:35:07,365 --> 00:35:09,461
Well, he must have had
a damn good reason.

533
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:12,453
And I'm not gonna let some
guy you didn't even know

534
00:35:12,508 --> 00:35:14,000
draw him into question.

535
00:35:14,157 --> 00:35:15,753
Deb, I'm not
questioning anything.

536
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,501
That's why you got
a tox screen, too.

537
00:35:25,158 --> 00:35:26,590
I need to clear my head.

538
00:35:28,825 --> 00:35:30,423
Where are your car keys?

539
00:35:35,735 --> 00:35:37,371
Deb, I ordered the
tox screen because

540
00:35:37,408 --> 00:35:38,960
Joe had no history
of heart disease

541
00:35:38,996 --> 00:35:40,540
and the coroner's
report was inept.

542
00:35:40,575 --> 00:35:41,402
You did it

543
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:43,752
because, for some reason,
he is important to you.

544
00:35:43,785 --> 00:35:45,353
It was professional curiosity.

545
00:35:45,386 --> 00:35:46,750
Then you will be
professionally glad to know

546
00:35:46,806 --> 00:35:48,802
that the only
toxin in his system

547
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:50,101
was a sedative,

548
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:51,952
which he probably took to...

549
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:54,232
I don't know, sleep.

550
00:35:54,756 --> 00:35:56,150
That would surprise me.

551
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:58,253
Joe was 30 years sober,

552
00:35:58,287 --> 00:35:59,382
I haven't found
anything stronger

553
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,100
than Advil in his
medicine cabinet.

554
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:07,041
It wouldn't be the first time an
addict fell off the wagon, Rita.

555
00:36:07,306 --> 00:36:09,001
Or someone slipped
him the sedative

556
00:36:09,056 --> 00:36:11,403
so he wouldn't struggle when he
was injected with something.

557
00:36:11,906 --> 00:36:13,372
Like?

558
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:15,002
Diabetic insulin.

559
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,251
It can cause cardiac arrest.

560
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:18,552
We've seen it before.

561
00:36:18,608 --> 00:36:20,003
It's nearly impossible
to detect

562
00:36:20,057 --> 00:36:21,552
unless you can find
a point of injection,

563
00:36:21,587 --> 00:36:23,190
which I wasn't looking for,
but if I had a chance

564
00:36:23,258 --> 00:36:25,353
- to examinate the body, I --
- Jesus Christ!

565
00:36:25,557 --> 00:36:27,652
He's not even your family!

566
00:36:28,966 --> 00:36:30,973
Mom and dad were.

567
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,613
I am.

568
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:37,583
Are you gonna start
questioning me now?

569
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:39,171
You? Why would I --

570
00:36:40,008 --> 00:36:42,782
Joe Driscoll was obviously
bad fucking news,

571
00:36:42,816 --> 00:36:45,802
which is why dad didn't want
you to know anything about him!

572
00:36:45,877 --> 00:36:48,102
Doesn't that matter to you?!

573
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:53,150
I don't know what
you want from me.

574
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:01,510
I want what dad wanted.

575
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:04,471
I want nothing to
do with this guy.

576
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:07,442
Let's just finish packing
up this crappy house

577
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:09,580
and walk the fuck away!

578
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:12,470
All right. That sounds like
a good plan. Okay?

579
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,500
<i>I guess I understand
why Deb is upset.</i>

580
00:37:31,537 --> 00:37:33,131
<i>We both idolized Harry,</i>

581
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,153
<i>lived by what he taught us...</i>

582
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,301
<i>Though Deb never
had to be taught</i>

583
00:37:37,337 --> 00:37:39,203
<i>not to kill innocent people.</i>

584
00:37:42,287 --> 00:37:43,700
<i>That's why she
doesn't understand</i>

585
00:37:43,745 --> 00:37:45,102
<i>why I need to know.</i>

586
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:51,801
Howdy, neighbor.

587
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:53,232
Let me get that for you.

588
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:55,802
Well, thank you.

589
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,102
I was just wondering --

590
00:37:57,158 --> 00:38:00,152
Did you happen to notice any
visitors over at Joe's last week?

591
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:01,893
Visitors?

592
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:03,283
Oh, I'm not sure.

593
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:06,473
I'm just wondering if he
has any outstanding bills --

594
00:38:06,665 --> 00:38:10,190
A gardener, maybe, or
a delivery person, repairman?

595
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,561
Well, come to think of it,
there was a, um,

596
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:16,143
cable repairman here last week.

597
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:17,591
He was polite.

598
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:20,723
But, you know,
he couldn't fix my TV antenna.

599
00:38:21,325 --> 00:38:23,150
You remember what
he looked like?

600
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,910
Well, he had dark hair...

601
00:38:28,328 --> 00:38:31,960
Average height --
Normal, I suppose.

602
00:38:36,257 --> 00:38:39,063
I did some checking on our
suspect Jacques Bayard.

603
00:38:39,545 --> 00:38:41,602
You lending I.A. a hand?

604
00:38:41,976 --> 00:38:44,402
I just like to know what's
going on in my department.

605
00:38:44,976 --> 00:38:46,803
And what is going on?

606
00:38:46,995 --> 00:38:49,203
Turns out Mr. Bayard
changed his name

607
00:38:49,238 --> 00:38:50,560
when he immigrated here.

608
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,950
Used to be Rene Thibault,

609
00:38:53,307 --> 00:38:56,310
a former officer in
the Haitian military.

610
00:38:57,705 --> 00:38:59,902
Didn't your tour in
the army include some...

611
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,203
special op in Haiti?

612
00:39:03,835 --> 00:39:04,803
Right.

613
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:07,202
"Special" means you
don't talk about it.

614
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,702
But I know you've heard as
many horror stories as I have

615
00:39:10,756 --> 00:39:12,223
about what went
on down there

616
00:39:12,287 --> 00:39:13,992
with those death squads.

617
00:39:15,057 --> 00:39:16,873
What were they called?

618
00:39:17,626 --> 00:39:19,831
Tonton Macoute.

619
00:39:20,296 --> 00:39:22,702
Yeah, "the bogeymen."

620
00:39:24,956 --> 00:39:27,201
They did a lot of
terrible things,

621
00:39:27,577 --> 00:39:29,311
killed a lot of people.

622
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:36,110
They made mothers carry the
heads of their dead sons,

623
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:39,773
forced fathers to
rape their daughters.

624
00:39:40,006 --> 00:39:43,102
They tied cinder blocks around
people's necks and drowned them

625
00:39:43,296 --> 00:39:44,901
and put mutilated
bodies in trees

626
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:47,513
and killed anybody who
tried to take them down.

627
00:39:50,775 --> 00:39:53,073
This man, Jacques Bayard,

628
00:39:53,656 --> 00:39:55,851
if he did those things...

629
00:39:57,176 --> 00:39:59,672
he deserved a lot
worse than he got.

630
00:40:06,908 --> 00:40:08,553
Don't worry, James.

631
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,240
It'll be over soon.

632
00:40:14,726 --> 00:40:16,362
I know it will.

633
00:40:36,007 --> 00:40:39,623
<i>If Joe was shot up with insulin,
there will be an injection welt...</i>

634
00:40:40,186 --> 00:40:43,242
<i>Maybe between his
toes or in a freckle.</i>

635
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:45,253
<i>If it's there, I'll find it.</i>

636
00:40:49,945 --> 00:40:51,582
Small towns.

637
00:41:15,665 --> 00:41:19,711
Come on, Dr. Pittman, which
crematorium did you send Joe to?

638
00:41:38,877 --> 00:41:41,771
Hey! You! stop! Come on!

639
00:42:03,468 --> 00:42:04,421
Get in!

640
00:42:13,807 --> 00:42:15,091
Heard you sneak out.

641
00:42:15,605 --> 00:42:17,412
Took a guess where
you were headed.

642
00:42:18,598 --> 00:42:20,372
Figuring I'd need a ride?

643
00:42:20,408 --> 00:42:22,040
Figured I could
talk you out of it.

644
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:24,033
No such luck, huh?

645
00:42:24,725 --> 00:42:26,413
Deb will be delighted.

646
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:29,370
As far as I know,
you went out for a walk.

647
00:42:34,355 --> 00:42:36,751
Jesus, Dex,
did you steal something?

648
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:39,920
Well, my fingerprints
were all over it.

649
00:42:40,037 --> 00:42:42,630
I figured it was prudent to
get rid of the evidence.

650
00:42:42,807 --> 00:42:44,682
It's just a box of ashes.

651
00:42:46,487 --> 00:42:49,731
- Joe was cremated, then?
- Yep.

652
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,503
Guess you weren't
able to find out

653
00:42:52,535 --> 00:42:54,533
if he was injected
with anything.

654
00:42:54,757 --> 00:42:55,682
No.

655
00:42:58,716 --> 00:43:01,580
- What are you gonna do with him?
- I don't know.

656
00:43:05,418 --> 00:43:07,292
Hmm, dumpster?

657
00:43:09,096 --> 00:43:11,110
I have a better idea.

658
00:43:26,556 --> 00:43:27,613
You know...

659
00:43:29,847 --> 00:43:31,671
No matter what Harry said,

660
00:43:32,238 --> 00:43:34,393
no matter what Deb thinks,

661
00:43:35,138 --> 00:43:36,902
that's your father.

662
00:43:37,108 --> 00:43:39,082
Cardboard box?

663
00:43:39,266 --> 00:43:40,902
I know you don't want
to acknowledge it,

664
00:43:40,938 --> 00:43:43,741
which is why you're running around,
breaking and entering,

665
00:43:43,776 --> 00:43:45,842
searching for some killer.

666
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:48,701
But you took that

667
00:43:48,807 --> 00:43:50,602
because there's a part of you

668
00:43:51,205 --> 00:43:53,402
that knows that this...

669
00:43:55,068 --> 00:43:56,663
that box...

670
00:43:57,607 --> 00:43:59,903
is your real father.

671
00:44:18,207 --> 00:44:19,401
My father.

672
00:44:35,285 --> 00:44:37,022
Sounds strange.

673
00:44:38,496 --> 00:44:39,530
I know.

674
00:45:40,366 --> 00:45:42,102
You all right?

675
00:45:43,495 --> 00:45:45,402
I was just getting some air.

676
00:45:49,888 --> 00:45:53,602
Oh, hey, I found something
in Joe's closet.

677
00:45:54,007 --> 00:45:55,751
It's just a bunch of papers.

678
00:45:56,065 --> 00:45:57,851
They're over there.

679
00:46:12,668 --> 00:46:14,453
Any clues?

680
00:46:24,577 --> 00:46:25,502
Hey, buddy.

681
00:46:26,797 --> 00:46:29,001
- How you feeling?
- Good.

682
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,100
It kind of itches,
but they have ice cream here.

683
00:46:32,606 --> 00:46:34,060
Life's a trade-off.

684
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:35,700
What are you making there?

685
00:46:35,905 --> 00:46:37,352
A thank-you card.

686
00:46:38,278 --> 00:46:41,230
See? The nurse brought me
the crayons and everything.

687
00:46:41,418 --> 00:46:42,750
Who's it for?

688
00:46:43,058 --> 00:46:47,663
Well, she said I should thank
the man who gave me the blood.

689
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:48,803
I mean,

690
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:52,500
that's normal, right,
giving thank-you cards?

691
00:46:58,158 --> 00:46:59,600
Yes, it is.

692
00:47:01,176 --> 00:47:02,720
It's just that he's gone.

693
00:47:03,646 --> 00:47:05,523
And we won't be
seeing him again.

694
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:08,102
I'm sorry.

695
00:47:08,438 --> 00:47:10,121
That's all right.

696
00:47:10,156 --> 00:47:12,701
It doesn't really
mean anything.

697
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:23,083
Yeah, it does.

698
00:47:24,355 --> 00:47:26,200
You keep drawing, son.

699
00:47:26,455 --> 00:47:28,252
I'll make sure it finds him.

700
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:30,850
Okay.

701
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,753
You had the case dropped?

702
00:47:51,126 --> 00:47:52,291
Excuse me.

703
00:47:55,767 --> 00:47:57,782
I.A. dropped Doakes' case.

704
00:47:57,906 --> 00:47:59,313
Do you seriously
think I have any say

705
00:47:59,345 --> 00:48:00,682
over what I.A. does?

706
00:48:00,717 --> 00:48:02,190
I put everything
on the line.

707
00:48:02,197 --> 00:48:03,671
I told I.A. the truth,

708
00:48:03,817 --> 00:48:05,750
and there's a lot of
evidence to back that up.

709
00:48:05,787 --> 00:48:07,423
What the hell happened?

710
00:48:07,607 --> 00:48:09,451
Maria! I deserve to know.

711
00:48:09,506 --> 00:48:11,712
All I know is that
I.A. got a call

712
00:48:11,747 --> 00:48:13,101
from an agency
in Washington.

713
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:15,172
- What agency?
- I'm guessing military.

714
00:48:15,206 --> 00:48:16,803
They said the
case involved some --

715
00:48:16,837 --> 00:48:18,932
sensitive foreign-relations issues,

716
00:48:19,007 --> 00:48:21,203
so they were gonna
handle it from there.

717
00:48:21,228 --> 00:48:22,453
They disappeared it.

718
00:48:22,485 --> 00:48:24,052
I always knew Doakes
had a history with them.

719
00:48:24,107 --> 00:48:25,601
I figured Special Forces,

720
00:48:25,646 --> 00:48:26,850
but this kind of reach --

721
00:48:26,885 --> 00:48:28,101
You think it was
black ops, CIA?

722
00:48:28,207 --> 00:48:29,302
Maybe.

723
00:48:31,847 --> 00:48:32,873
Probably.

724
00:48:33,937 --> 00:48:36,473
And I ratted him out.
Jesus Christ.

725
00:48:36,606 --> 00:48:37,600
Angel...

726
00:48:38,205 --> 00:48:40,303
You did what you
thought was right.

727
00:48:46,308 --> 00:48:47,803
Squeak, squeak.

728
00:48:48,405 --> 00:48:49,951
Do you have a problem?

729
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:51,200
Officer Benson,

730
00:48:52,548 --> 00:48:54,802
you just bumped
into your superior.

731
00:48:56,307 --> 00:48:59,801
I believe you owe detective
Batista an apology!

732
00:49:02,068 --> 00:49:03,090
Yes, sir.

733
00:49:05,406 --> 00:49:06,902
I'm sorry, sir.

734
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:46,802
I know I should
be sorry that

735
00:49:46,846 --> 00:49:48,752
we met under these
circumstances,

736
00:49:49,005 --> 00:49:50,400
but truthfully,

737
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:52,702
I think it was the best
way to get to know you.

738
00:49:55,795 --> 00:49:58,090
Realtor says you
won't get much for it.

739
00:50:01,618 --> 00:50:03,252
More than if I kept it.

740
00:50:04,257 --> 00:50:05,902
Are we good?

741
00:50:10,386 --> 00:50:11,740
We're fine.

742
00:50:17,707 --> 00:50:19,203
All right.

743
00:50:19,476 --> 00:50:21,180
I'll see you back
at the station.

744
00:50:36,808 --> 00:50:39,202
Cable repair man.

745
00:50:40,097 --> 00:50:43,391
Wait! Wait!
No, no, don't go.

746
00:50:43,718 --> 00:50:45,170
Wait!

747
00:50:45,408 --> 00:50:47,400
Please, I want to
ask you something.

748
00:50:49,806 --> 00:50:50,881
Wait!

749
00:50:53,288 --> 00:50:55,160
Alone again.

750
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:57,451
Finally.

751
00:51:00,548 --> 00:51:01,663
You know what?

752
00:51:04,345 --> 00:51:05,893
I'm glad you were here.

753
00:51:06,766 --> 00:51:08,742
Thought you would be.

754
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:16,642
The cable repairman --

755
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:21,352
Did he say anything
about my TV antenna?!

756
00:51:23,908 --> 00:51:24,900
No!

757
00:52:01,015 --> 00:52:02,463
Rita, it's me.

758
00:52:06,486 --> 00:52:07,751
They're asleep.

759
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,701
Yeah, well,
I should have been here, okay?

760
00:52:09,757 --> 00:52:11,303
It's late,
and you're drunk

761
00:52:11,357 --> 00:52:13,433
and you can't keep coming
by here unannounced.

762
00:52:13,477 --> 00:52:16,263
You don't call the shots, okay?

763
00:52:16,808 --> 00:52:18,501
Paul, I want you to leave.

764
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:20,350
I don't give a
fuck what you want.

765
00:52:20,407 --> 00:52:21,953
I want my fucking kids!

766
00:52:21,988 --> 00:52:23,153
You're gonna scare them.

767
00:52:23,355 --> 00:52:24,501
They don't want to see me?

768
00:52:24,538 --> 00:52:27,601
Those kids are gonna remember who
the head of this fucking family is.

769
00:52:30,505 --> 00:52:31,900
You're right.

770
00:52:32,306 --> 00:52:33,700
I've been awful.

771
00:52:34,155 --> 00:52:37,260
I just didn't realize I
was hurting you so much.

772
00:52:37,507 --> 00:52:39,303
But I can make
it up to you.

773
00:52:39,707 --> 00:52:41,601
Let me try.

774
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:58,200
Where are you going?

775
00:52:59,366 --> 00:53:01,990
Want to play rough? Huh?
Is that what you want?

776
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:03,300
No!
No!

777
00:53:04,095 --> 00:53:05,601
Fucking whore.

778
00:53:05,697 --> 00:53:08,603
Come on.
Come on!

779
00:53:18,046 --> 00:53:20,290
Wake up. Wake up. Come on.

780
00:53:59,408 --> 00:54:01,501
<i>I had a father...</i>

781
00:54:02,216 --> 00:54:05,011
<i>Someone other than
Harry who called me son.</i>

782
00:54:06,247 --> 00:54:08,802
<i>The thought never
even occurred to me.</i>

783
00:54:09,528 --> 00:54:11,402
<i>Harry was all I needed.</i>

784
00:54:12,605 --> 00:54:15,143
<i>It was Harry who always
had the answers.</i>

785
00:54:16,065 --> 00:54:19,852
<i>He knew who was good,
bad, safe...</i>

786
00:54:20,435 --> 00:54:22,330
<i>And dangerous.</i>

787
00:54:22,907 --> 00:54:25,142
<i>I built my life on Harry's code.</i>

788
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:26,602
<i>I lived by it.</i>

789
00:54:27,705 --> 00:54:29,471
<i>But Harry lied.</i>

790
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,622
<i>Why would he do that?</i>

791
00:54:31,906 --> 00:54:33,871
<i>What else don't I know?</i>

792
00:54:34,386 --> 00:54:37,913
<i>My concrete foundation is
turning to shifting sand.</i>

793
00:54:38,337 --> 00:54:40,010
<i>Maybe Rudy was right --</i>

794
00:54:40,347 --> 00:54:42,692
<i>You never can
truly know anyone.</i>
