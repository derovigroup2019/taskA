1
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,480
Previously on "dexter"...

2
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,250
what happened changed something inside you, dex.

3
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,310
It got into you too early.

4
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,090
I'm afraid your urge to kill is already that strong.

5
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,840
I want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

6
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,930
What can I do to help?

7
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,650
No blood.

8
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,290
What a beautiful idea.

9
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,920
Refrigerated truck.

10
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,630
He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood.

11
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,120
I su ppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

12
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,240
In fact, I think this is a friendly message.

13
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,940
Kind of like, "hey, want to play?

14
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,830
" Finding that truck is your golden ticket into homicide.

15
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,100
So miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle, right?

16
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,860
I just found the fucking needle.

17
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,390
Oh, this is seriously fucked up.

18
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,970
I think he's trying to impress me...

19
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,160
and it's working.

20
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,230
That captain believes you should be reassigned from vice to homicide.

21
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,120
Thank you, sir.

22
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,890
Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

23
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,290
Arrr!

24
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,370
Are you gonna kiss him?

25
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,440
Actually, yes.

26
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,070
We just got an I.D. On the body from under the causeway.

27
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,570
His name is ricky simmons.

28
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,150
He was a cop.

29
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,870
Matthews: Ricky simmons was under deep cover in carlos guerrero's family?

30
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,050
Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

31
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,590
Now he's gone and pissed off the entire miami police department.

32
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,130
It's me.

33
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,670
It's james, okay?

34
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,570
It's okay.

35
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,570
Was kara sleeping with someone other than ricky?

36
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,420
Was it you?

37
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,140
James, she died.

38
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,190
Miami's full of good cops, a lot of them here today.

39
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,490
But no offense -- I wouldn't want any of you hitting on my sister.

40
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,190
Ricky was different.

41
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,200
He was the kind of guy you hoped your sister would fall for.

42
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,050
Most people have a hard time dealing with death, but I'm not most people.

43
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,910
It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable.

44
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,290
Not because I'm a killer -- really.

45
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,340
I just don't understand all that emotion, which makes it tough to fake.

46
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,740
In those cases, shades come in handy.

47
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,360
Doakes: Mac.

48
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,190
I'm sorry, man.

49
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,580
Thanks, man.

50
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,220
It's a fucking travesty.

51
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,980
You going after guerrero?

52
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,970
Guerrero ordered these hits.

53
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,430
I'm gonna make something stick to that cartel cocksucker.

54
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,580
I didn't know you and ricky were so tight.

55
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,870
Ain't about that.

56
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,380
Fuck with a cop, you lose the privilege to walk the streets.

57
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,860
- You're right. - You're right.

58
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,330
Tragic loss of our fellow officer.

59
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,760
But we praise his courage.

60
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,720
Ricky knew no fear.

61
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,570
Can you believe laguerta?

62
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,970
She didn't even know simmons.

63
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,720
She knew he was a cop.

64
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,440
Er, wait.Did you tell her?

65
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,920
Proud of you for coming, bro.

66
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,420
I know you hate funerals.

67
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,890
How you holding up?

68
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,130
I'm managing.

69
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,910
No, I'm not.Keeping one's face pinched in sorrow for two hours straight is a real chore.

70
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,280
A whole life reduced to ashes.

71
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,880
For ricky simmons, it's over.

72
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,910
But sometimes, you get a second chance.

73
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,710
Florida prisons kick free 25,000 inmates a year.

74
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,700
They don't do that for me, but it sure feels like it.

75
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,600
I search for the ones who think they've beat the system.

76
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,830
They're not hard to find, like jeremy downs.

77
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,610
Jeremy got off easy -- four years in a juvenile facility for manslaughter.

78
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,490
To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.

79
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,670
impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.

80
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,290
Too many major arteries were severed -- femoral, brachial, carotid.

81
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,090
Today jeremy is just another piece of trash on the street,

82
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,560
but four years ago, he was the toast of miami.

83
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,240
It was a gruesome scene today

84
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,140
the bloody body of a teenage boy found stabbed to death inside this south miami park.

85
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,790
Police haven't released the name of the victim yet,

86
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:06,230
but our sources are telling us that investigators are holding a 15-year-old suspect in custody.

87
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,490
We're hearing that the suspect lured the older boy to the pond to spot alligators,

88
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,880
but once they were alone, the victim was robbed and repeatedly stabbed.

89
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,410
But I knew what he was and what he'd do again.

90
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,490
All I had to do was circle my calendar and wait.

91
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,030
Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

92
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,030
What do you say, crew? Anybody parched?

93
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,790
What's parched?

94
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,330
When we put in the new lemon tree, we'll be able to make our own fresh-squeezed lemonade.

95
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,570
Can we have a lemonade stand?

96
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,660
I'll apply for a business license first thing in the morning.

97
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,670
Thank you for doing this, dexter.

98
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,130
You know, I moved here from michigan with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.

99
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,680
But they keep dying.

100
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,920
I can't help it.

101
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,350
I kill things.

102
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,020
That must be awful.

103
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,840
Fortunately, I have a green thumb.

104
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,890
The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.

105
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,330
Bone meal works the best.

106
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,300
Hey, rita.

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,930
Paul doesn't live here anymore.

108
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,460
No shit.

109
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,460
He's in jail.

110
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,430
But, uh, see, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

111
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,330
Don't get involved.

112
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,980
I never know in these situations.

113
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,820
I don't have money.

114
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,550
You got a car.

115
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,200
You want my car?

116
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,100
Yeah.The keys in it?

117
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,150
You know my dad?

118
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,350
I sure do, little man.

119
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,740
And you want to know something?

120
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,790
You look just like him.

121
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,500
I'm gonna tell him you said hi, okay?

122
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:54,450
Look, if you want, I could go in the house, throw your furniture around, make a real mess,

123
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,550
but what kind of message would that send to the little ones?

124
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,050
Just give me the fucking car.

125
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,380
Why don't you go inside and get the keys?

126
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,200
I'll wait with our friend here.

127
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,570
What?

128
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,150
You think you can take me with your little red shovel?

129
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,430
Everything okay in there?

130
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,040
Yeah.

131
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,730
You need toilet paper?

132
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,290
No.

133
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,220
The guy clearly had no idea who he was dealing with.

134
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,240
I'll file a report at work.We'll get your car back.

135
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,340
No, uh, n-no reports, dexter.

136
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,950
Thank you, but, uh, paul's out of my life.

137
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,880
I filed for divorce.

138
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,490
I just want my past to go away.

139
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,450
Well, it went away in your rav 4.

140
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,670
Whatever it takes.

141
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,850
I can give you a ride to work until you get another car.

142
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,270
Or I could take the bus like millions of other people.

143
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,400
Come on, let's go outside and enjoy this beautiful day.

144
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,180
Come on, kids.

145
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,170
Angel: What did they use, an ax?

146
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,950
It's blunt force.

147
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,460
See the way the head's caved in?

148
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,740
Hmm.

149
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,720
You guys check out the new hottie mcgotass in dispatch yet?

150
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,200
She's a butter face.

151
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,960
What's a butter face?

152
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,600
You know, compadre -- she's got a hot body, but her face...

153
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,280
how great would it be to pull a bronco on her?

154
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,780
Yeah.

155
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,130
Yeah?

156
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,310
Mira a qu?

157
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,460
You do it doggy-style, right?

158
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,580
And just when she's getting into it, you grab her by the hips and you yell another woman's name, and bam

159
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,710
you're riding her like a bronco 'cause she's trying to buck you off.

160
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,970
Many times in life, I feel like I'm missing some essential piece of the human puzzle.

161
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,390
This is one of them.

162
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,460
What are you doing?

163
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,700
Oh, the bronco.

164
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,190
See, socia? She knows.

165
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,200
I just got my first official homicide call.

166
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,520
He's back.

167
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,820
Who's back? The ice-truck killer?

168
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,130
That's right.

169
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,350
You won't believe where he left the body.

170
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,770
I knew we'd be back.

171
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,890
Feels like christmas morning.

172
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,480
Look at that -- a miracle on ice.

173
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,190
Stunning.

174
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,150
You all right, dexter?

175
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,300
This is like a dream.

176
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,480
Standing on the home ice of the miami blades.

177
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,680
I never pegged you for a hockey fan.

178
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,060
Yeah, there's something about standing in a big, cool hole I find very relaxing.

179
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,010
So, what do we know?

180
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,940
Same as the others.

181
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,940
No blood.

182
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,840
So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts.

183
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,490
No bones flayed.

184
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,940
I think our boy's got his confidence back.

185
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,480
He never lost it.

186
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,980
He was just getting bored.

187
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,980
What do you think he's trying to tell us?

188
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,250
That hockey's a violent sport.

189
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,570
What else?

190
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,200
He's escalating the thrill.

191
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,110
Posing his victim in the middle of a 20,000-seat arena for all miami to see, to show them

192
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,740
to show us -- what he's capable of doing.

193
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,360
What did I miss?

194
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,230
Relax.You didn't miss anything.

195
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,880
Yeah, but she is -- fingertips.

196
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,640
This body belongs to the frozen fingertips we found in the truck.

197
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,940
Sherry taylor.

198
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,520
It's another prostitute.

199
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,520
No blood -- no need for me.

200
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,650
Morgan, come up to the command center.

201
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,350
We may have a suspect.

202
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,330
Is there really a suspect?

203
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:45,420
I'll let you know, bro, when I get back from my first official homicide investiga

204
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,760
I know her.

205
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,940
Sherry?

206
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,080
Yeah, she called herself cherry.

207
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,110
Um, we worked the same corner when I was undercover.

208
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,990
You were, like, friends?

209
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,650
Yes.

210
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,360
Do you want a hug?

211
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,030
Fuck off.

212
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,690
I tore apart the security office.

213
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,960
A surveillance tape is missing.

214
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,500
Let me guess -- the one covering the ice.

215
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,860
They said you were good.

216
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,080
I've got the press knocking on the door outside.

217
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:24,190
Somebody who was here last night saw something -- rent-a-badge, uh, cleaning crew, crack whore in the men's room?

218
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,130
Come on, work with me.

219
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,220
They got a night watchman, but we can't find him.

220
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,450
Well, then, he's a suspect.

221
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,300
Unless the ice-truck killer abducted him to gain entry into the arena.

222
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,930
Did your brother help you out with that logic?

223
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,720
The night watchman could've just been at the wrong place at the wrong time.

224
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,840
We need to get to his apartment to see what we can find.

225
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,930
I was hoping I could hit kiocho, talk to my old contacts.

226
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,230
I thought you wanted to get out of vice.

227
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,180
Isn't that what you cried to the captain last week?

228
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,470
Yeah, I mean...

229
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,890
I didn't cry.

230
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,870
Listen, my girls know this victim, okay?

231
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,610
They may have information that could help us.

232
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,340
No, I want you to work with doakes.

233
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,910
Maria, she has contacts.

234
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,900
You still got your tube top?

235
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,590
And my nipple clamps.

236
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,880
Don't come back without any information.

237
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,580
Everyone moves to miami to die, which means we have more junk than any city in america.

238
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:44,120
A skilled bargain hunter can find real treasure here, but that's not my idea of hunting.

239
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,460
I prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach.

240
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,140
My instincts are impeccable, but I have to be sure of my prey.

241
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,190
We're all adrenaline rats, you know?

242
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,210
Kill it till it dies.*************

243
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,400
We all meat hunters, just out looking for dinner.

244
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,210
What you looking for?

245
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,550
Can I see that one?

246
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,870
Eh, good eye.

247
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,520
It's a fixed-blade skinning knife.

248
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,720
Full tang, stainless steel.

249
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,270
Real time-saver for the hunter who likes to do his own butchering in the field.

250
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,910
See the way that blade curves like that?

251
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,800
It's like the talon of an eagle.

252
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,160
15 bucks and she's yours.

253
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,710
I'll take it.

254
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,010
Hell, yeah, you'll take it.

255
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,220
Why would you not?

256
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,970
I'll get your change.

257
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,040
Easy, kid.

258
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,980
What the fuck are you doing, boy?

259
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,540
I didn't see him.

260
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,730
You all right, mister?

261
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,080
Yeah, I'm fine.

262
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,340
Honest mistake.

263
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,360
No harm.

264
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,600
Hey.

265
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,090
You be careful with that thing, huh?

266
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,360
Sorry about that, boss.

267
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,900
I only sell them.

268
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,920
So, what you hunt -- trophies or meat?

269
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,540
What do you think toda dex?

270
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,360
The winchester?

271
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,230
What about the 9mm?

272
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,900
A handgun?

273
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,340
Not exactly the weapon of choice for pheasants.

274
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,770
You need a wide spread to bring them down.

275
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,010
Did you ever shoot anybody, dad?

276
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,530
Afraid so.

277
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,630
Any of them die?

278
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,110
Just one.

279
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,710
How'd it feel...

280
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,520
to kill a guy?

281
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,230
Not so great, dex.

282
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,610
When you take a man's life, you're not just killing them.

283
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,730
You're snuffing out all the things he'll ever become.

284
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,250
As a cop, I only fire my weapon to save a life.

285
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,980
That's a code I live by.

286
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,200
Killing must serve a purpose.

287
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,150
Otherwise, it's just plain murder.

288
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,970
You understand?

289
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,400
Yeah.

290
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,990
Changed my mind.

291
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,410
I think we'll take the ruger.

292
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,220
Rifle?

293
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,070
I thought that shotguns were best for pheasants.

294
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,220
We're not gonna hunt pheasants.

295
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:41,720
It's a big one.

296
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,950
Yeah.

297
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,420
This deer will put meat on our table tonight.

298
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,020
It's still alive.

299
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,880
For now, this hunt will control the urges you feel.

300
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,460
Channel them.

301
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,400
Why don't you go ahead, son?

302
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,050
Really?

303
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,970
Put the poor animal out of its misery.

304
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,320
"Community Mourns loss of Kara Simmons"

305
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,010
Vodka, please.

306
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,390
Hi, rose.

307
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,230
Hi.

308
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,900
Congratulations on your confirmation.

309
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,890
Thank you.

310
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,140
Do I know you?

311
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,680
My name's james doakes.

312
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,570
Miami metro P.D.

313
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,650
I'm investigating the murder of an undercover cop and his wife.

314
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,530
Oh, that's terrible.

315
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,650
Were they members of the church?

316
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,580
No, rose, they weren'T.

317
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,820
Oh, I don't understand.

318
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,850
Rose, have you ever seen this man before?

319
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,980
I don't know.

320
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,500
Why are you asking me?

321
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,630
Get away from my daughter.

322
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,070
It's okay.

323
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,910
At my church?

324
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,960
In front of my family?

325
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,150
Ricky and kara had a family, too.

326
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,660
You just opened a dangerous door.

327
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,780
No, man, you did...

328
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,750
when you murdered a cop and an innocent lady.

329
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,810
What is he talking about, daddy?

330
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:19,920
Come on, honey.Let's go.

331
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,340
Let's go!

332
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,910
You don't play by the rules, guerrero.

333
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,600
Why should I?

334
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,340
You've got five minutes, bizach, okay?

335
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,810
Yo, look who's back.

336
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,900
Pero mirela, como est* caliente!

337
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,750
Who'd you fuck -- dolce or gabbana?

338
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,030
I let them both pull a train, okay?

339
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,570
Listen, I, uh, I got a confession to make.

340
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,060
I'm, uh...

341
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,480
I'm not who you think I am.

342
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,100
I'm a cop.

343
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,600
Bridgett, get back -- bridgett!

344
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,140
I'm not gonna bust -- you're not a cop.

345
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,270
You're a whore.

346
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,230
I'm not a fucking whore.

347
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,460
What's wrong with being a fucking whore, huh?

348
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,470
We trusted you, brandy.

349
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,260
My name's debra, okay?

350
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,540
And I'm not here to bust you.

351
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,530
He hit again -- the ice-truck killer.

352
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,820
He got cherry.

353
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,410
Cherry?

354
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,490
This shit's crazy.

355
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,390
I'm out.

356
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:32,210
I got a sister who lives in ohio, runs a fashion-boutique store.

357
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,500
I'm on the bus tomorrow.

358
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,930
I ain't closing my shop for no sick, psycho bitch.

359
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,560
Fucking woman-hater.

360
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,060
I was on the street before him.

361
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,260
Fuck it.

362
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,170
I can get him, you guys.

363
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,020
You just got to give me something.

364
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,870
Did any of you all see cherry with anyone the night before last?

365
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,120
Well, I saw her last night, and then she got into a car and never came back.

366
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,390
But I was working all night, so...

367
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,470
you know the driver?

368
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,890
No, but the car was, like, one of those old station wagons that have, like, wood panels on the side.

369
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,830
This is good.

370
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,090
This is a lead.

371
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,630
I should go get laguerta to listen.

372
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,970
Who's laguerta?

373
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,290
Uh, she's my lieutenant.She hates me.

374
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,330
But I'm close with the captain.I'll talk to him.

375
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,900
What?

376
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,720
Never piss off your pimp.

377
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,210
Laguerta's not my pimp.

378
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,620
Is that right?

379
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,720
Bitch tell you what to do?

380
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,560
Is your pussy taking all the grief?

381
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,450
Does she steal everything you earn?

382
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,710
Yeah, she definitely does that.

383
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:35,700
Then she's your pimp, baby, and she will mess you up if you play her.

384
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,460
I told you -- I'm not a fucking whore.

385
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,490
What's wrong with being a fucking whore?

386
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,250
Hey.

387
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:53,570
Bought you a present to celebrate your first official homicide case.

388
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,180
Seriously?

389
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,090
It's a cactus.

390
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,650
You only have to water it three times a year.

391
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,830
Gee, dex, you didn't have to go out of your way.

392
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,680
I didn'T.I was at the swap meet.

393
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,760
So, any news on our frosty friend?

394
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,260
One of my contacts said she saw cherry getting in a wood-panel station wagon the night she died.

395
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,990
Did you check the dmv database?

396
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,340
As we speak.

397
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:25,370
There are thousands of registered station-wagon owners in miami-dade county, but guess who's not on the list?

398
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,460
The night watchman.

399
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,900
I knew laguerta had her head up her ass on that one.

400
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,050
She doesn't have shit on the real ice-truck killer.

401
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,350
Good.

402
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,670
Why good?

403
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,620
It's good for you.

404
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,480
You're gonna be the one to apprehend that heinous murderer, not her.

405
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,920
Thanks.

406
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,810
All right.

407
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,190
Good night, sister.

408
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,050
Don't stay up too late.

409
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,790
Okay.

410
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,010
Thanks for stopping by.

411
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,570
Hello?

412
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,850
Hi.

413
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,890
Are you -- is this a bad time?

414
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,640
It's rita.

415
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,950
No, it's fine.Hi.

416
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,220
I was just, uh, reading a sad story.

417
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,630
Is everything okay?

418
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,800
Yes, I'm -- look, the thing is...

419
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,490
you need me to pick up cody after school?

420
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,520
No.

421
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,200
Colleen's gonna take him to karate with hudson.

422
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,580
What about astor's piano?

423
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,360
Jen's got that covered.

424
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,860
Look, it's social services.

425
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,420
There's a caseworker coming by the house this afternoon.

426
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,130
I should be home by 4:00, but with the buses...

427
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,400
I'll be there.

428
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,820
Don't worry about a thing.

429
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,250
Thank you, dexter.

430
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,980
As you all know, a night watchman from the hockey arena is missing.

431
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,060
Till now, we presumed he was abducted or murdered by the ice-truck killer.

432
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:03,170
However, we searched his apartment and found a stolen surveillance tape from the night of the murder.

433
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,660
Chief of security at the hockey arena confirmed it.

434
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,490
The man you're looking at is tony tucci, the missing night watchman.

435
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,510
And here's the best part -- tucci has a record.

436
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,150
He pulled a ife at a party in '97.

437
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:21,800
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you tony tucci, the ice-truck killer.

438
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,510
Bullshit.

439
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:28,020
Captain matthews is coordinating with the fdle to launch a statewide manhunt as soon as we get clearances.

440
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,940
Does he drive a station wagon?

441
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,040
Excuse me?

442
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,820
Tucci -- what kind of car does he drive?

443
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,870
The last-known victim was seen getting in a station wagon.

444
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,750
I don't recall asking for any questions, miss morgan.Thank you!

445
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,600
Now, from this moment on, all our resources go to finding this man.

446
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,210
Your individual assignments will be coming shortly.

447
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,230
That's all for now.

448
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,330
Doesn't make sense.

449
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,570
After being so careful for so long, why would he leave recorded evidence?

450
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,810
Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

451
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,120
He's still out there, and I'm waiting...

452
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,720
breathless.

453
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,450
You sure we can't get you anything?

454
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,460
I'm fine.

455
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,390
Rita's usually home in time for the kids.

456
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,570
I'm just backup.

457
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,070
Her bus must be late.

458
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,230
My files say ms.Bennett's supposed to have personal transportation.

459
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,620
Oh, yeah, well, she did and will again very soon.

460
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,330
Probably next week.

461
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,900
***************I just have to make a note of it.

462
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,270
She's doing an exemplary job.

463
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,640
I wish all my home visits were this lovely.

464
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,280
So why do you keep coming around, then?

465
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,190
Routine follow-up for all domestic-violence cases.

466
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,800
We need to ensure a stable home environment exists.

467
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,780
It's a good thing.

468
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,930
The system does work from time to time.

469
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,520
I was actually taken in by a wonderful family.

470
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,150
No abuse.

471
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,390
In fact, my foster father understood I had special needs.

472
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,130
Without him...

473
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,630
you're lucky.

474
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,370
Lucky.

475
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,990
I'm here!

476
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,370
Hey, everyone, I'm here.

477
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,180
Sorry.

478
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,780
It's okay.

479
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,690
I am lucky.

480
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,880
What do I know about abuse?

481
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:18,580
Without the code of harry, I'm sure I would've committed a senseless murder in my youth just to watch the blood flow.

482
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,550
Just try and keep him comfortable.

483
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,060
It's about all we can do for him now.

484
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,580
I don't understand.

485
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,960
A week ago, the doctor said he was getting better.

486
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,980
He is getting better, sweetie.

487
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,520
A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.

488
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,020
What does that mean?

489
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,180
What the hell does that mean?

490
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,260
She's weird.

491
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,820
Listen, you two...

492
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,620
I'm not going to be around much longer.

493
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,370
Dad, don't say that.

494
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,570
You can make it through this if you fight.

495
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:57,920
When I'm gone, I won't be able to stop you from being who you are.

496
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:03,370
Sooner or later, you'll need to do it.

497
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,800
Do what?

498
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:11,020
Just remembeour lessons.

499
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,460
What lessons?

500
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,230
What are you talking about?

501
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,230
I can't make it without you.

502
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,390
Yes, you can.

503
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,010
If you feel like you're slipping...

504
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,600
lean on your sister.

505
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,200
She'll keep you connected.

506
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,960
Fucking forensics report.

507
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,790
What'd they find?

508
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,940
Tucci's hair and fiber.

509
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,200
Of course tucci's hair and fibers are on the body.

510
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,080
He's hauling her around with his pork hands, isn't he?

511
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,260
Any word from the chem lab?

512
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,200
Same as the other murders.

513
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,700
The killer used liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissue, give it that bleached look.

514
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,810
You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is?

515
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,400
You'd have to be a lab rat just to mess around with that shit.

516
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,120
Tucci didn't even pass high school chemistry.

517
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,340
Watch carefully.

518
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,380
Right there -- see?

519
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,420
Right before he repositioned the torso.

520
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,400
He turned his head.

521
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,560
Like someone's giving him directions.

522
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,800
Someone like the ice-truck killer holding a motherfucking gun to his back.

523
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,210
The killer's framing tucci.

524
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,610
It looks that way.

525
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,770
Laguerta's gonna lose her sheep shit when she finds out.

526
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,600
She's gonna have to cancel her press conference.

527
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,400
And you know how laguerta loves her press conferences.

528
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,080
Can I borrow this tape?

529
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,340
Bingo.

530
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:15,100
I know what happens next in this gruesome little scenario.

531
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,250
Jeremy is trying to re-create his first kill, ritualize it.

532
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,690
You ready?

533
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,550
I don't know if I want to do this, man.

534
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,520
What's wrong?

535
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,040
I thought you wanted to see an alligator.

536
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,060
I do.

537
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,160
It's in the marsh up here.

538
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,480
Wait.

539
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,700
Are you a pussy?

540
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,950
No.

541
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,840
Okay.

542
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,740
It's right up here.

543
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,330
Come on, jer.

544
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,040
What are you talking about?

545
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,090
Don't be a bitch.

546
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,420
Here we are.

547
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,460
I don't see it.

548
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,090
It's right there.

549
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,010
See its eyes sticking out?

550
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,590
You have to get closer.

551
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,180
I still don't see it.

552
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,250
Really?

553
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,680
Maybe I was wrong.

554
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,530
There's no gator here, is there?

555
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,330
I don't know, lucas.

556
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,380
Is there?

557
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,290
Anyone see a frisbee?

558
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,620
It flew in here somewhere.

559
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,370
**************************

560
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,710
What am I doing out here?

561
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:10,130
Oh, fuck!

562
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,420
Fuck!

563
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,780
Fuck!

564
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:30,000
All I had to do was drive home, have a taco, plan my attack.

565
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,920
Instead, dearly deluded dexter tried to act human, like it's my job to save lives.

566
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,890
Code of harry never covered this.

567
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:58,150
At least I know where jeremy is and what I need to do.

568
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,380
Don't let her.

569
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,430
Okay, my brave little soldier.

570
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,220
Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.

571
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,330
No!

572
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,520
Wait!

573
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,400
What is it, honey?

574
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,020
He doesn't want the shot.

575
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,650
Your father's very sick.

576
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,120
He's in a lot of pain.

577
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,190
He needs a shot.

578
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,490
I want pain.

579
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,110
He wants pain.

580
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,710
I'll have to tell the doctor.

581
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,270
He's not going to be happy you're refusing your medication.

582
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,150
You can tell.

583
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,350
About the nurse?

584
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,440
She'S...

585
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,060
like me.

586
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,790
How could you tell?

587
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,160
She gives too much...

588
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,560
morphine.

589
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,400
It's something else.

590
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,740
It's making me worse.

591
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,660
She's drugging you.

592
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,850
She's killing you by overdose.

593
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,260
Not just me.

594
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,710
Others, too.

595
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,050
Stop her.

596
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,690
What do you mean, stop her?

597
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,380
It's time.

598
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,970
Before she hurts anyone else.

599
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,280
See the look on his face, like he's scared?

600
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,470
Like he has a gun pointed at him?

601
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,800
Oh, I don't know, debra.

602
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,990
It's not much -- a look off-camera.

603
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:51,880
There's more.

604
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:57,920
One of my vice contacts, gabrielle -- I trust her -- she saw the victim get into a wood-paneled wagon the night of the victim's death.

605
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,310
That was the last time anyone saw her.

606
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,240
Did a background report on tucci.

607
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,640
He doesn't even own a car.

608
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,190
***********There's no fucking way this guy can be the ice-truck killer.

609
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,880
Sir.

610
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:12,060
What does lieutenant laguerta say about all this?

611
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,950
I came straight to you, captain.

612
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,800
You went around the back of your commanding officer?

613
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,260
Laguerta doesn't listen to me.***********

614
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,440
You don't violate the chain of command.

615
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,080
You just don'T.

616
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,540
Now, listen, debra.

617
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,950
I gave you a shot in homicide because I think you can make a halfway-decent detective.

618
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:34,030
But if I find you can't swim in these waters, I'll put you right back on the street.

619
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,790
You got it?

620
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,620
Yes, sir.

621
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,160
Your father never would've pulled the kind of shit you just did.

622
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,110
Did you know that one of your officers has information that casts some doubt on this manhunt of yours?

623
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,330
Who, morgan?

624
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:59,170
I realize you're something of a folk hero around here, maria,

625
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:04,390
but it would be a mistake to ignore the work of a promising officer just to further your political career.

626
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,070
Is that what you think I'm doing?

627
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,450
You were a middle-of-the-pack detective before the press got ahold of you.

628
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,130
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

629
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,570
It's a reality check, and you need it.

630
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,580
And I got it.

631
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,750
Let's cut to the chase.

632
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,250
Are you telling me to call off my manhunt?

633
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,040
'Cause I will remind you that jeb bush himself signed off on it.

634
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,420
No, uh, no.

635
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,940
You go ahead and hold your press conference, maria.

636
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,240
People of this city need to know we're doing something about this mess.

637
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:38,730
But don't expect me to bail you out if that night watchman turns out to be a dead end.

638
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,110
A statewide manhunt is under way right now in florida.

639
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:49,020
According to police, a night watchmans on the run after the dismembered body parts of a young south beach woman were found tuesday,

640
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,070
stacked on the home ice of the miami blades.

641
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:56,140
The woman is believed to be the latest victim of the notorious ice-truck killer,

642
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,160
now responsible for five deaths in the greater miami area.

643
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,150
These terrible attacks have to stop.

644
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,610
And we have to stop them.

645
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:10,890
With tony tucci now linked to the murders, it's our mission to find him.

646
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,380
Fucking joke.

647
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,630
Hey, going out tonight with the guys, blow off a little steam -- you in?

648
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,360
Hey, man, sounds good.

649
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,830
Pick you up at 8:00.

650
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,890
Elevator's around the corner and to your left.

651
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,660
Enjoy your stay with us.

652
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:43,770
Hello?

653
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:46,070
Rita, this is mr.Curtis.

654
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,570
Are you coming to pick up astor?

655
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:51,580
Oh, no, a friend of mine is -- denise.

656
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,710
Is she not there?

657
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,200
I'm afraid not, but your daughter is.

658
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,490
She's the last k left here at school.

659
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,140
I don't have a car.

660
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,470
Is she okay?

661
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:06,720
Yeah, she's just fine, but we can't keep her here much longer.

662
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,250
Okay.

663
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,720
Okay, I'll work something out.

664
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,500
Do it again!

665
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,280
Let's not wake up cody.

666
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,940
Now, let's see about that splinter.

667
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,010
That's a deep one.

668
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,710
This might sting a bit.

669
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:40,330
But the magical splinter fairy will soon make you forget all about it.

670
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,810
Who's the magical splinter fairy?

671
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,520
She's the second cousin to the tooth fairy.

672
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,200
She brings candy if you put your splinter under your pillow at night.

673
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,780
The tooth fairy is make-believe, just like the boogeyman.

674
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,690
Hi, guys.

675
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,290
You're right, astor.

676
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,100
There's so such thing as the boogeyman.

677
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,700
But the splinter fairy -- she's the real deal.

678
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,230
Will the splinter fairy come if I cry?

679
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,730
Thanks for picking her up.

680
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,260
If I had a heart, it might be breaking right now.

681
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,390
**************

682
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,120
Who we picking up now, man?

683
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,720
'Cause he sure ain't sitting on my lap.

684
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,560
We're not picking up anybody, bro.

685
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,870
Well, what we doing in the gables?

686
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,730
I told you.

687
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,620
We're blowing off some steam.

688
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,130
This is it.

689
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,010
What the hell is this?

690
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,610
It's a disguise.

691
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:11,120
One of guerrero's top lieutenants -- he lives here, and we're gonna fuck him up.

692
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,930
Hold up, mac.

693
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,740
I thought you said you wanted to go out and get shit-faced, man.

694
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,740
I am shit-faced.

695
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,480
How do I look?

696
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,950
Man, I'm all for sending the message, but this -- this ain't the way, man.

697
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,590
Why the hell not?

698
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,370
The guy's scum.

699
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,430
Mac, listen.I've got to talk to you.

700
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,510
Mac, mac!

701
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,630
Hey, listen up, man.

702
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,150
I showed my face to guerrero.

703
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,860
They gonna think I'm behind this shit.

704
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,320
That's part of the plan.

705
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,060
What plan?

706
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,510
You fucked my sister.

707
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,270
You fucked a cop's wife.

708
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,140
Now you're just fucked, buddy.

709
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,180
Shit.

710
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:19,830
Motherfucker!

711
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,850
Hey, quit fucking around.

712
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,470
Turn on the lights.

713
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,200
Come on, man.

714
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,530
Turn on the fucking lights!

715
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:55,660
You're mine now.

716
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,550
What do you want?

717
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,460
Silence.

718
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,660
You gonna fuck me, faggot?

719
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,710
'Cause I killed the last guy who raped me.

720
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,490
What guy?

721
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,070
He raped you...

722
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:13,520
the guy you killed when you were 15?

723
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,890
Why didn't you tell anybody?

724
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,020
Would you?

725
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,970
He fucked me, and I killed him, and if you try, I'll kill you, too.

726
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,400
I understand now.

727
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,950
Why didn't I see it before?

728
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:34,260
Jeremy didn't murder that boy four years ago.

729
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,620
He was taking out the garbage.

730
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,750
Just like I do.

731
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,580
Look, I really don't want to cancel all my credit cards, and I hate waiting in line at the dmv,

732
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:50,870
so give me back the wallet you stole from my car, or I'll break your fucking neck.

733
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,450
It's in my backpack.

734
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,930
Wait -- is that all?

735
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,820
You want more?

736
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,160
That boy who raped you four years ago -- did he deserve to die?

737
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,270
Yeah.He did.

738
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,470
Well, the boy last night didn'T.

739
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,170
Remember that.

740
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:40,810
It could save your life one day.

741
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,460
Mr.Tinker?

742
00:44:53,140 --> 00:45:00,120
Mr.Tinker, Mr.Tinker, where are you?

743
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,850
Mr.Tinker?

744
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:08,880
Are you trapped behind the couch again, mr.Tinker-stinker?

745
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,840
The nurse was my first playmate.

746
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:18,770
I'll always be grateful to her for opening up so many magnificent new doors for me.

747
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,630
Things were a little messy in the beginning.

748
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,810
Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.

749
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,280
But I was trained well.

750
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:48,850
Those who witnessed my early stumbles never had a chance to tell.

751
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:09,580
I've just been looking through your photo album.

752
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:11,840
Hope you don't mind.

753
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,460
Are all your victims in here?

754
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,370
I'm sorry.Let me help you with that.

755
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,720
Scream and lose a tongue.

756
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:06,270
I-I helped them...

757
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:10,700
all of them.

758
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,750
I took their pain away.

759
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,510
I understand.

760
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,590
Now it's time to take away your pain.

761
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:41,170
It was messier than I anticipated, but it was still a special day.

762
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:51,350
But, of course, it was really harry who paved the road to my salvation.

763
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:59,690
With the nurse put down, harry lived another year before hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him,

764
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,020
but his lessons have never failed me.

765
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:12,230
Harry taught me that death isn't the end.

766
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:17,130
It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful.

767
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,040
He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside...

768
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:37,650
but we must maintain appearances to survive.

769
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:51,800
But there was something harry didn't teach me, something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know.

770
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:57,470
The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

771
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:03,090
It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.

772
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,530
Sweet ride!

773
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,040
Is it yours?

774
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:21,170
It's yours, until your mom can get a new one.

775
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:24,020
I borrowed it from impound right before auction.

776
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:24,990
Dexter...

777
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:26,060
can we get in?

778
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,500
You better.

779
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:37,260
All you can do is play along at life and hope that sometimes you get it right.

780
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,400
Thank you.

781
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:59,110
Score one for the little wooden boy.
