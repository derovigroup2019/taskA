1
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,240
Previously on "dexter"...

2
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,139
think this is our guy's work?

3
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,589
The ice-truck killer?

4
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,559
Laguerta insulted the real killer's intelligence,

5
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,209
and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

6
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,050
It's the guard -- tucci.

7
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,690
I think he's alive.

8
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,070
Tucci's alive?

9
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,389
The ice-truck killer is keeping him alive to
perform amputations.

10
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,378
He's sending me a message.

11
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,630
He wants me to go there.

12
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,350
Please.

13
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,599
He was left here so I would kill him.

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,619
Just kill me.

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,376
I can't kill this man.

16
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,040
I'm taking tucci over to county alive.

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,079
I don't know who your contacts are, morgan,

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,729
but you are my up-and-comer.

19
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,219
You saved a man's life tonight.

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,919
The thing that surprises me most about rita
is

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,019
how much I like being with her.

22
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,380
There's all sorts of things I can do.

23
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,620
what are you doing?

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,300
Whatever I want.

25
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,199
My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,400
the kill he left for me, but I did.

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,224
I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

28
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,300
I'm dexter.

29
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,780
I like to pretend I'm alone, completely alone

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,150
maybe post-apocalypse or plague

31
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,670
whatever no one left to act normal for

32
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,030
no need to hide who I really am.

33
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,690
It would be freeing.

34
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,639
Stop grinning like a fucking psycho and get
back to work.

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,150
Sorry, sergeant.

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,609
I was just waiting for forensics to wrap up

37
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,724
before I tear the bed apart.

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,746
I'm not the only one who enjoys isolation.

39
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,800
My shadow companion chose this place well.

40
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,270
This was his sanctuary, for a while, at least.

41
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,160
All these people pawing over it seems...

42
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,810
disrespectful.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,779
Tell me the sick bastard bled on something,
dexter.

44
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,719
He was here for days, playing with sharp
objects.

45
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,399
I'll keep looking, but so far this place is spotless

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,249
amazingly so.The only blood I found belongs
to the security guard.

47
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,659
Has he said anything yet?

48
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,329
Mr. Tucci's still unconscious.

49
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,369
Lieutenant, up here!

50
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,419
There's got to be something here. Find it.

51
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,489
The guy's not a ghost.

52
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,793
Tony tucci is evidence of that.

53
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,419
Hey, dexter, you get all this blood on
camera yet?

54
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,151
It's like shooting a jackson pollock.

55
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,280
Well, your jackson pollock is in the bag.

56
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:50,880
Ready?

57
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,480
Okay.

58
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,110
Whoa. What was that?

59
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,329
Did you see that?

60
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,360
What?

61
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,820
Damn rats.

62
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,499
We're all gonna get histoplasmosis from all their shit in the dust.

63
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,290
We'll be coughing up blood, skin lesions, mouth sores.

64
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,400
Lovely.

65
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,594
Can we get the lights, guys?

66
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,290
You ever heard of rat-bite fever?

67
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,370
Masuka

68
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,468
what'd I say about the fucking rats?

69
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,219
You haven't found anything, won't find
anything.

70
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,669
This is a bust, right?

71
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,110
In so many words.

72
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,689
Which means I'm just jerking off till tucci wakes up.

73
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,809
So take a break.You've been working this thing 24-7.

74
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,199
Or are you still avoiding a personal life?

75
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,199
Oh, fuck you.

76
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,019
And, yeah, I'm better off just focusing on the job.

77
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,150
Thanks, guys.

78
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,579
It doesn't have to be either/or.

79
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,010
Maybe not for you.

80
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,609
If I found someone, so can you, right?

81
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,102
Yeah, the trouble is keeping them.

82
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,160
Tell me about it.

83
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,670
Yelina?

84
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,930
Are you okay?

85
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,080
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

86
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,900
Ernesto hasn't arrived?

87
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,820
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

88
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,120
No.

89
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,170
The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

90
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,780
Coyote?

91
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,939
You mean the man you paid to bring him here?

92
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,721
He said he sent ernesto back to cuba.

93
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,589
But that was a week ago,

94
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,919
and no one in c*rdenas has heard from
ernesto.

95
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,160
Yelina, how did you contact this coyote?

96
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,189
...this was his number, but it's not working anymore.

97
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,009
I was supposed to leave him money in a park.

98
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,409
Listen, my boyfriend works for the police.

99
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,809
I'm sure he --no, no, no.

100
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,369
We can't go to the police.

101
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,729
He said he'd hurt my family in cuba if we go to the police.

102
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,070
No, it's okay.

103
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,300
It's okay.

104
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,630
Dexter will know what to do.

105
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,150
I feel just terrible for her.

106
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,169
And they were supposed to be married after
he got here.

107
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,529
I do know someone in the department

108
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,769
who deals with immigration issues.

109
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,799
I can talk to him.

110
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,829
That's really kind of you, dex.

111
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,927
I mean, can you imagine not knowing if your
fiance is dead or alive?

112
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,860
Uh, no.

113
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,811
Every night after work yelina goes across
the street, to the beach.

114
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,130
I've seen her there, just staring out at the water,

115
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,540
willing him to walk out of it.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,510
Have you ever longed for anything like that?

117
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,229
She wants something from me.

118
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,479
Ever since the blow job,

119
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,389
she assumes we've taken it to the next level.

120
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,149
She doesn't know yet, I don't have a next
level.

121
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,378
Well, when I was a kid, I would have killed
for an atari.

122
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,040
You know?

123
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,437
Cody would laugh at the graphics now, but
back then, man...

124
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,989
It always comes to this once sex is
introduced.

125
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,699
Small talk no longer cuts it.

126
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,919
Eventually she'll call me a science project

127
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,330
and slam the door in my face.

128
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,408
But when do you think he'll wake up?

129
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,799
Yeah, I did call an hour ago, but there's a killer out there

130
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,589
that's into whores and security guards,

131
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,817
but I'll bet nurses are next.

132
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,140
Yo, check you, all "mpd blue."

133
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,219
Shanda, what are you doing here?

134
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,349
You have another lead on the ice-truck
killer?

135
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,449
Man, I got bigger worries than that sick
shit.

136
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,229
Now, I got me a girl on the inside, right?

137
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,639
I'm not springing your pimp, if that's what
you're after.

138
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,659
Oh, hell, no.

139
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,429
But my landlord's another fucking story --

140
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,819
trying to kick me out of my home.

141
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,519
He got no cause, except he's a born-again hypocrite mother fucker.

142
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,939
Yeah, and you want me to talk to him?

143
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,349
No, I want you to beat in his pasty, white
face.

144
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,690
Morgan.

145
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,189
Found this in evidence.

146
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,775
Masuka was gonna grease it through.

147
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,350
A cigarette butt?

148
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,359
Jesus, we could pull dna off of that, or
even a print.

149
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,709
Except it would be your print.

150
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,290
You were smoking on a crime scene.

151
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,419
Not on the crime scene --like on the way-far
end of the park.

152
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,619
The whole area's a crime scene.

153
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,679
You should know that by now.

154
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,019
Maybe you ought to just calm the hell down,
my brother.

155
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,049
Who the fuck is that?

156
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,799
Give it a rest, shanda.

157
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,949
Morgan, go do something useful.

158
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,449
Go sit on that security guard until he wakes
up.

159
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,042
And do not talk to him without me.

160
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,709
Believe me --your maid is not the first one
to get screwed.

161
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,969
No, she's a maid.

162
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,404
She's not my maid.

163
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,649
So, have you heard of any other cuban
immigrants disappearing?

164
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,540
A few.The poor bastards.

165
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,529
They spend their life savings,

166
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,029
get stuffed into a fishhold, puke the whole
90 miles to miami.

167
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,269
Then they get here, thinking,"I'm an american. I'm free."

168
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,920
Except the damn coyote...

169
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,460
he won't let them go till his family comes up

170
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,634
with a surprise release fee.

171
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,890
If they can't pay... they disappear.

172
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,547
Freedom's just another word for one more way to get fucked.

173
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,941
Sounds like someone's doing something very bad.

174
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,349
You have any suspects?

175
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,050
Sure, four or five, mostly cubans themselves,

176
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,437
but not enough evidence for a conviction or
even a warrant.

177
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,379
If warrants were applied for,

178
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,048
their names will be in the database.

179
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,760
Look, buddy...

180
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,409
I know you want to help out your maid,

181
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,769
but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.

182
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,850
You'd be surprised.

183
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,970
Jorge castillo --

184
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,259
number 3 on the department's list of suspects

185
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,779
but the only one even remotely close to the
park

186
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,002
where yelina was supposed to drop the money.

187
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,689
They never got enough evidence for a search
warrant

188
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,855
but I don't need permission to keep an eye on this guy.

189
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:29,270
No neighbors, no foot traffic --it's promising.

190
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,360
A good place for human trafficking... or
worse.

191
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,680
Excuse me.

192
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,170
Private yard.

193
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:50,400
I'm just praying you have a '69 stingray
headlight somewhere in here.

194
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,260
Uh, dave cutler.

195
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,200
Jorge castillo.

196
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,220
I'm sorry, but I don'T.

197
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,179
Man, my restoration's almost done.

198
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,375
She's a beauty.

199
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,849
I don't do individual sales, mr. Cutler,

200
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,479
but I can give you the name of a corvette
shop I deal with.

201
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,198
I'll be happy to look around myself.

202
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,029
No offense, man, but I can't take my phone orders

203
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,139
if I'm watching over my merchandise.

204
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,419
You run this whole place alone?

205
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,597
Yeah, it keeps my costs down.

206
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,959
Hey, I'm sorry you made the trip out here.

207
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,230
You know what?

208
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,134
Try wexler's, out in tamarac.

209
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,740
That's my vette guy.

210
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,290
Yeah.

211
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,099
Must be nice being your own boss --

212
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,899
get out in the water whenever you want.

213
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,839
I saw that floater on your key chain.

214
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,019
I got to get one of those.

215
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,859
Lost my keys overboard twice in the past
year.

216
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,829
I do a little fishing.I got a 32-foot
concept.

217
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,030
What about you?

218
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,172
I got a rowboat with a hole in it.

219
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,300
A lo major los pescados te encuentran.

220
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,190
I don't speak spanish, sir.

221
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,428
Sorry.I just assumed you were cuban.

222
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,010
American, pal, just like you.

223
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,920
Just like me.

224
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,939
He's on heavy sedatives at the moment.

225
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,815
I think he deserves them.

226
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,500
I'll wait.

227
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,460
Hey.

228
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,990
Mr. Tucci.

229
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,800
Tony.

230
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,400
I'm gonna find this cocksucker.

231
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,200
I swear.

232
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,947
I don't understand america's obsession with
cars.

233
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,799
I can just imagine squeezing rita and the
kids

234
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,029
into that thing and hitting the open road --

235
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,239
cramped quarters, public bathrooms,

236
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,682
hours of nothing but conversation.

237
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,760
It's someone's american dream -- my
nightmare.

238
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,226
This must be where castillo locks them up.

239
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,849
But if he's killing them when they can't pay

240
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,000
he's not doing it here.

241
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,540
So where are they?

242
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,400
Dexter morgan.

243
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,550
Gerard here.

244
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,769
There's a floater down in south beach morgue.

245
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,139
Could be a match for your maid's fianc?

246
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,510
She's a maid.

247
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,969
She's not my --is it all right if I bring her down?

248
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,599
The sooner, the better.

249
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,205
Okay, then. Thanks.Have a good day.

250
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,670
Tonight at the salsa room.

251
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,261
You got to help me celebrate my pay-grade
bump.

252
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,989
Actually, I have a personal project I'm working on tonight.

253
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,409
Blow it off.I'm buying.

254
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,079
Angel, do you have that list of prioritized
witnesses?

255
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,589
I can't deal with 800 anonymous tips.

256
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,869
I'm working on it.

257
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,800
Well, how about you stop talking and earn
your bump?

258
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,820
Sexy.

259
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,879
Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro.

260
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,699
It's you and me.

261
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,739
I wonder what I did to make him think we're so close.

262
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,900
I wonder if it'd work on rita.

263
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,660
Dexter morgan --I called earlier.

264
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,705
Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.

265
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,030
Yeah.

266
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,634
Hey, jerry, can you take these guys around
back?

267
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,830
Should I?

268
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,613
Nah,I'll go with her.

269
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,578
She might need a shoulder.

270
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,100
She senses I'm not a shoulder.

271
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,620
Bad sign -- she's catching on.

272
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,059
I don't know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube

273
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,445
is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean.

274
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,760
If you ask me, man, it's darwin's theory at
work.

275
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,100
That must be what love looks like.

276
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,150
The inability to feel has its advantages...

277
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,930
...sometimes.

278
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,680
Hey, dexter.

279
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,820
Hey, mindy.

280
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,449
Do you need any help?

281
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,480
No.

282
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,350
So, are you gonna go to the spring formal?

283
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,854
Why would I want to do that?

284
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,349
She wanted you to ask her to the dance,
dexter.

285
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,969
That's not what she said.

286
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,764
Well, you have to learn their signals.

287
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,782
Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.

288
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,240
Oh.

289
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,460
I just like being alone.

290
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,764
But most normal people don't

291
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,859
and it's important that you seem normal.

292
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,420
Even though I'm not.

293
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,450
Because you're not.

294
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,519
We'll start you off with a temporary prefab

295
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,849
and then make adjustments as we go.

296
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,852
Rudy here's gonna put back together again, good as new.

297
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,319
Half the battle is attitude,

298
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,029
and you have a great one.

299
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,230
Well, I'm alive.

300
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,670
I didn't see that happening, but here I am.

301
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,040
Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder,

302
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,137
and I got a hottie waiting on me, so...

303
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,980
I don't know.

304
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,532
I just might have to fight you for this one.

305
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,569
Okay, we'll arm-wrestle later.

306
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,300
Now get out of here.

307
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,119
Watch out for this guy.

308
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,540
He's a dog.

309
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,870
Excuse me.

310
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,540
I know what you need, guys, but I didn't see much.

311
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,351
Well, any detail will help, mr. Tucci.

312
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,030
Well... he came up on me from behind,

313
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,880
and he wore a mask when he made me put the...

314
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,330
the... things on the ice.

315
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,560
I'll get it.

316
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,670
Angel of mercy.

317
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,138
Just how merciful are you?

318
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,969
Oh, you are a dog, aren't you?

319
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,656
So the ladies tell me.

320
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:14,628
Can you tell us how tall he was or if he was
black, white, latino?

321
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,250
White, I think.

322
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,750
I'm guessing maybe average height --

323
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:24,090
not fat, not thin, just average.

324
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,600
I don't know.

325
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,980
And when he started, you know, working on me,

326
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,670
I was blindfolded, so...

327
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,540
did u hear anything?

328
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,179
Did he have an accent or anything?

329
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,750
He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.

330
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,755
And that's all you heard?

331
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,890
Except the rats.

332
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,690
Sometimes they would crawl up on the bed,

333
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,163
and I'd have to shake them off.

334
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,389
Some crap-ass witness I am, huh?

335
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,659
You're doing fine.

336
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,919
You've given us a lot.

337
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,730
Yeah?

338
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,010
Yeah.

339
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,409
You know, sometimes when I'm trying to remember something

340
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,260
I close my eyes.

341
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,190
Really?

342
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,570
We could even blindfold you again.

343
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,589
...I'm kind of tired right now.

344
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,950
It's okay.Get some rest.

345
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,750
Officer morgan and i are leaving.

346
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,760
Alone.

347
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,340
No pretending.

348
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,000
No hiding.

349
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,250
No time to relax.

350
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,890
I'm too close.

351
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,750
Jorge castillo is bad.

352
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,080
That I know.

353
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,339
But bad enough to have killed yelina's fianc?

354
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,360
That I have to prove.

355
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,350
Jorge's not-so-humble abode.

356
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,100
Yeesh -- new money.

357
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,540
Normal people dream of this --a new car, a
big home,

358
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,152
a boat at the reef shore marina...

359
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,409
...and a beautiful wife.

360
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,934
Too bad -- I never enjoy making someone a
widow.

361
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,920
They're so happy.

362
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,433
She has no clue who she's with.

363
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,350
Maybe that's the secret to a successful relationship.

364
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,939
Mr. Perry, you were on the grounds

365
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,459
of the same hospital where we found mr.
Tucci.

366
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,399
And you were alone that night?

367
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,290
Uh, it was just me and caesar, my dog.

368
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,639
He likes abandoned buildings.Caesar's a ratter.

369
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,109
What did this guy do?

370
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,539
Why? Does he look familiar?

371
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:11,490
Yes, he looks like an actor from that john
singleton movie.

372
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,642
What was that?

373
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,269
How about you focus on whether or not he was
thman

374
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,889
you saw at the old hospital that night, mr.
Perry?

375
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,979
Well, it was difficult to tell.

376
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,210
It was dark.

377
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,733
You said you got a look at him.

378
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,070
He had a cap.

379
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:35,260
Hey, is that kg-230 hooked into a digital
cctb network?

380
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,279
Ooh, you better have a hell of a firewall.

381
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,779
You get better resolution with the 440.

382
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,930
Hello.

383
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,450
We're done here.

384
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,200
Give me a minute.

385
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,380
Morgan, thank mr. Perry for his horseshit
and send him home.

386
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,019
Christ on a crutch, he could tell us
something.

387
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,049
Sergeant doakes says he is a looky-loo.

388
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,379
We get dozens like that every time a story
hits the news.

389
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,671
Now do me a favor --get him out of my
precinct.Thank you.

390
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,119
You could try being a little more optimistic.

391
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,069
I mean, if tony tucci can be optimistic, I
think we can.

392
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,539
You might get more out of people.

393
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,169
How do you know perry doesn't know anything?

394
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:30,983
Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.

395
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,660
Okay.

396
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,089
This case is getting colder every minute you
waste on bullshit like perry.

397
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,929
And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?

398
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,296
What the fuck were you thinking?

399
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,869
Tucci's closed for business now, and you shut him down.

400
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:49,330
I... I was trying a new approach.

401
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,369
Maybe you should just learn the basics

402
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,100
before you reinvent the damn wheel.

403
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,869
come on.How can you not dance to this?

404
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,940
It's a gift.

405
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,369
We just need some more patr?n, compadre.

406
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,700
Another round!

407
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,829
No more for me.

408
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,969
I got to get up early --killers to catch.

409
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:29,876
Forget that.

410
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,899
The night's just beginning, right, ladies?

411
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,810
Yes!

412
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,405
Ladies, excuse us.Angel, come here.

413
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,100
Your wife --she's probably worrying.

414
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,459
I don't know what she'd think of your new
friend.

415
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,849
She don't mind who I flirt with as long as I bring home la pasion.

416
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,030
La pasion?

417
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,854
Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.

418
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,380
Hey, what about, uh, communication, trust?

419
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,420
La pasion.

420
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,130
Wait.

421
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,489
What if she wants something more?

422
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,932
Then you reciprocate --you know...

423
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,819
no, I meant what if she wants something more
emotionally?

424
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,859
Don't go down that emotional road.

425
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,389
Just go down on her.

426
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,629
It's easier, and she'll be distracted.

427
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,681
Come on.Let's dance, angel.

428
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,470
So...

429
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,741
what do you want to do now?

430
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,440
Dance with her, dexter.

431
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,740
Be polite.

432
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,020
Get her punch.

433
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,856
Open the door for her.

434
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,989
And if you find yourself alone with her

435
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,069
and things get romantic --

436
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,689
dad, I've kissed a girl before.

437
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,060
You have?

438
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,690
Yeah.

439
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,950
And?

440
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,240
I don't know.

441
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,510
It was okay.

442
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,429
Dexter, women are different from men.

443
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,759
We've had this talk, dad.

444
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,189
I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.

445
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,039
When they're with someone, physically, they feel connected.

446
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,999
And they know when you're not.

447
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,269
They can sense it because you're very exposed.

448
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,379
Yeah, you're naked.

449
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,720
I mean emotionally.

450
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,939
Son, this is going to be very dangerous for
you.

451
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,250
I can fake it.

452
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:11,255
Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.

453
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,370
This is a tough one.

454
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,900
Is this it?

455
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,719
Angel, I've only been here one time.I don't
remember.

456
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,440
Wake up.

457
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,568
Your wife's gonna love me.

458
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:02,858
The problem with acting normal is normal
people get into stupid situations like this.

459
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,459
Oh. You scared the hell out of me.

460
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,510
Sorry, nina.

461
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,090
I'm dexter.

462
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,369
You remember? I work with angel down at the
station.

463
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,182
What are you doing here?

464
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,340
It's funny.

465
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,389
We were out celebrating angel's pay-grade bump.

466
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,280
He got a raise?

467
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,370
Yeah.

468
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:27,620
Well, as you can see, he, uh, had a little
too much to drink,

469
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,998
so I gave him a ride home.

470
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,757
He doesn't live here anymore.

471
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,940
Oh.

472
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,680
We're separated.

473
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,210
Oh.

474
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,690
So... good night.

475
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,860
Oh, okay.

476
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,720
Good night.

477
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,930
Come on.

478
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,090
La pasion.

479
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,820
Angel.

480
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,700
Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.

481
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,249
I guess I had one too many, huh?

482
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,999
And then about 10 more.

483
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,526
How did I end up here?

484
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,080
You don't remember?

485
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,980
So you live here, huh?

486
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,400
I live here.

487
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,173
You're kind of neat, aren't you?

488
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,200
Bad habit instilled by mom.

489
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,500
Hey.

490
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,870
We better get going.

491
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,759
Pressure's on with this ice-truck-killer situation.

492
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,059
Yeah. You go ahead.

493
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,849
I'll lock up.

494
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,889
I have to stop by home anyway.

495
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,050
My wife's gonna be worried.

496
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,399
She gets so hot and bothered.

497
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,187
No, I'll just wait, and I'll drop you at your
car.

498
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,300
Where's your bathroom?

499
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,759
Somehow it's reassuring to know I'm not

500
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,820
the only one pretending to be normal.

501
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:38,580
I found hair on this one that doesn't belong to tucci --rat hair.

502
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,749
I probably picked up a parasite just --

503
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,119
don't test me, masuka.

504
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,630
Uh, you see all that shredding?

505
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,049
Half of this sheet must be lining their
nests.

506
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,569
They took evidence away from the crime scene?

507
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,290
Exactly.

508
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,139
So we check their nest.

509
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,670
Uh... wild goose chase, without knowing what
we're looking for.

510
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,829
We could talk to tucci again.

511
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,359
He knows more than he thinks,

512
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,689
and my gut tells me he can take it.

513
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:04,399
'Cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force.

514
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,050
Masuka, run the sheet.

515
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,109
See if we can trace it to manufacturer.

516
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,219
I've got court in the morning, so call me on my cell --

517
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,579
all right, I get it.I'm a newbie.

518
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,319
But you are old and tired, and you need new
eyes on this.

519
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,399
So when you're ready to let me do my job, you let me know.

520
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,483
And don't you fucking say a word, masuka.

521
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,869
How do you get rid of the ones who don't pay out?

522
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,419
Do you drop them in the middle of the ocean,

523
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,050
tell them to swim for shore?

524
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,353
You can't hide for long, jorge.

525
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,620
Hello?

526
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,160
Dexter, it's me.

527
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:44,269
Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you
since that place.

528
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,530
The morgue.

529
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,509
Do you think they'll be able to catch whoever did this?

530
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,789
I'm sure he'll get what he deserves.

531
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,119
How are you doing?

532
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,260
Still a little shaky.

533
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,209
I have some late-night work I have to do,

534
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,630
but I could stop by earlier, if you want.

535
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,789
Maybe we could rent a movie.

536
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:07,500
Yeah, I'll pick up a dvd --something light.

537
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,722
Maybe if I don't blink, my eyes will tear up.

538
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,740
I hate this.

539
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,969
I'm questioning every move.It's exhausting.

540
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,665
I should just break it off already,

541
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:45,700
unless I can pacify her, give
her... something, reciprocate.

542
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,400
La pasion.

543
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,800
Whoa, uh, dexter?

544
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,580
I'm sorry.

545
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,490
I-I, uh...

546
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,900
oh, I was just...

547
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:04,060
you were so generous with me.

548
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,740
I was gonna return the favor.

549
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:12,750
Oh, no, that's very sweet, but I'm sorry.

550
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,300
I'm just not in the mood for that.

551
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,800
That you, dex?

552
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,650
Yeah.Sorry I'm late.

553
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,280
It's okay, son.

554
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,109
You must have been having fun.

555
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,400
I pretended to.

556
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,929
That's good, dexter.

557
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:38,890
Dad?

558
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,590
Do you think that maybe one day I'll feel it for real?

559
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,390
I hope so, son.

560
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,690
I really do.

561
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,470
Alone, I'd be better off.

562
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,380
Relationships are too confusing.

563
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,850
But this I can figure out.

564
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,720
This I do well.

565
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,506
Jorge castillo's boat.

566
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,919
If he's a killer, then there's proof.

567
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,150
There's always proof, and I'll find it.

568
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:40,200
Happy, in love... the perfect couple.

569
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:44,447
I wonder if rita and the kids would like
fishing.

570
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,800
Focus.

571
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,579
If one of these matches the contact number
for ernesto's coyote,

572
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,700
you're it, jorge.

573
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,558
He drowns them here, then dumps them out
there.

574
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,548
If they wash up, it'll be chalked up to another inner-tube mishap.

575
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,160
Yep -- this I do well.

576
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,196
Think about his shoes.

577
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,352
Did he walk with a limp?

578
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,990
Did he move smoothly, like an athlete?

579
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,280
Try to remember, tony, for me.

580
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,430
I would if I could, hon.

581
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:24,170
You're a sweet lady, and smart using your charms on me.

582
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,340
No, no, I don't mind.

583
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,429
It's probably the last time a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.

584
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,330
It's okay, tony.

585
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,840
Maybe later.

586
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:38,060
We should try the blindfold.

587
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,770
What?

588
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,349
I don't want to do that.

589
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,679
I'm sorry, mr. Tucci.

590
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,859
I can't even begin to imagine what you've
been through

591
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,519
but it's our job to make sure that nobody else goes through it, too.

592
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,500
So, morgan, you're up.

593
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,120
He was hard to hear.

594
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,438
I never knew where he was.

595
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,909
So he's agile.That's good, tony.

596
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,659
What else did you hear?

597
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,600
Rats.

598
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,170
Always those damn rats.

599
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,238
Try to focus on him, tony.

600
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,090
What did you hear?

601
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,110
What did you smell?

602
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,480
Menthol.

603
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,930
Menthol?

604
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,090
Yeah, like cough drops.

605
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,274
He cleared his throat a lot.

606
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,300
You know, like --

607
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,680
He unwrapped them.

608
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:56,220
I could hear those wrappers, that crinkly
sound.

609
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,720
And he sucked on them.

610
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,360
I could hear them clicking against his teeth
when he...

611
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,524
The son of a bitch loved those fucking
lozenges.

612
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,970
Nothing in this nest.

613
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,979
Well, check another floor.They're all over this dump.

614
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,700
Fuck this.

615
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,320
Masuka.

616
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,199
We got another one over here.

617
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,300
Promising.Several fragments from the sheet
here.

618
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,680
These rat bastards were repeat customers.

619
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,410
Who had garlic for lunch?

620
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,069
I'm gonna punch you in the neck.

621
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:04,700
Actually... I think you're gonna french me.

622
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,900
...2934.

623
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,800
I like being right.

624
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,576
I usually am, about these things.

625
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,320
"Be prepared" -- my motto.

626
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,769
The boy scouts and i have that in common.

627
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:37,835
Of course,
there's no merit badge for tonight's outing.

628
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,589
What are we looking at?

629
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:04,799
They found the ice-truck killer's lozenge wrapper, thanks to your sister.

630
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,550
Lozenge wrapper?

631
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,369
Hey, after two months of finding fuck all in
this case,

632
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,719
a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.

633
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,879
My favorite serial killer is a lozenge eater.

634
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,100
How human of him.

635
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,550
We have a partial.

636
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,500
Partial print --a partial fucking print!

637
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,680
Proud of you, sis.

638
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,389
Hey, it's a celebration here.

639
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,759
Where are you going?

640
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,140
Crime scene.

641
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,550
Excuse me.

642
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,120
What's, uh --what's going on?

643
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,989
We've got our first piece of tangible evidence on the ice-truck killer.

644
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,639
A partial fucking print.

645
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,019
You run it through afis yet?

646
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,639
It doesn't even matter if we get a match.

647
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,549
He gets pulled in for something, anything, we
got him.

648
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,268
We get it photoed before we scan it.

649
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:58,269
...And let's keep working the old hospital site, people.

650
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,259
You never know.We might get lucky again.

651
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,860
It wasn't luck.

652
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:03,610
Good work, morgan.

653
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,810
Afuera, va.

654
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,340
Muevanse. Come on.

655
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,710
Come on!

656
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,100
Entrar, entrar.

657
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,500
God bless america.

658
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,790
Hon?

659
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,580
Where are you?

660
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,310
Honey?

661
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,200
Honey, you in here?

662
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,500
Iderrito a mi familia!

663
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,946
Get back in there, you cuban piece of shit!

664
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,600
Fucking animals.

665
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,650
Incredible.

666
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:57,349
They're an even better match than I thought --

667
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,720
true partnership.

668
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:11,249
You know, I rarely deviate from a plan,

669
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:15,420
but I just didn't have the heart to split up such A...

670
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,170
...Perfect couple.

671
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,790
You two...

672
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:29,250
have quite a lucrative operation going.

673
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,768
You're a really good team.

674
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,020
It's clever, too.

675
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:45,660
No one questions another drowned cuban man
or woman...

676
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,550
or child.

677
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,179
So, which one of you thought this up?

678
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,640
They get freedom.

679
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,780
We free them.

680
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,087
They thank us, for god's sake.

681
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,149
For drowning them and dumping their bodies
in the ocean? Please.

682
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,290
We can pay you.We have money.

683
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,952
That's what it's all about, right?

684
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:07,680
I love you.

685
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,959
I love you so much.

686
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,120
I love you so much.

687
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,069
I'm gonna ask you a question.

688
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,939
I want you to answer me honestly.

689
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,700
No more bullshit.Do you understand?

690
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,183
How long have you been married?

691
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,280
12 years.

692
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:33,401
How do you love each other?

693
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,950
You're like me, and you make it work.How?

694
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:41,519
We want the same life.

695
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,360
We both --

696
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,729
we want the same thing.

697
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:44,570
Same life.

698
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,750
You share the same dream.

699
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,200
Yes, exactly, yes.

700
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,140
Yes, that's it.

701
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,620
That's, uh...

702
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,480
...helpful.

703
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,770
Thank you.

704
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,000
No.

705
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:50,960
I like doing things properly, but I'm out of time,

706
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,718
and I still have to dispose of them.

707
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,200
Valerie got short shrift.

708
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:02,420
But all in all, it was a very good night.

709
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,130
I like this place.

710
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,910
A lot of memories are buried down there.

711
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:10,350
Deviating from the plan may have been ill-
advised.

712
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:28,000
But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

713
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,390
After all...

714
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,750
...isn't that what relationships are all about?

715
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,150
Do you have a dream...

716
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,150
...for your life...

717
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:19,620
your future, I guess?

718
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,260
Of course.

719
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:22,940
Do you?

720
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,400
It might sound weird.

721
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,500
I want to someday be content and just feel...

722
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:44,620
comfortable, like everyone else.

723
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,850
I want...

724
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:50,100
a normal life.

725
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:57,740
Yeah, a normal life.

726
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:00,610
That's all I want.

727
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,100
Just that.

728
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,810
No fame and fortune --

729
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,400
excitement at every turn?

730
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:11,890
No, I've had enough excitement.

731
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,490
Thank you.

732
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:14,910
Now...

733
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,850
I'll take boring.

734
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,090
Average.

735
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:21,650
Ordinary.

736
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:25,720
That's weird, huh?

737
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,550
Yeah.
