1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,965
Previously on Dexter:

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,604
You really believe in nothing?

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,451
I suppose I believe in
a certain set of principles

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,046
so that I don't get into trouble.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,204
Like something I might teach a puppy.
Is that so bad?

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Lieutenant Debra Morgan.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,925
If I could have feelings,

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,970
I'd have them for Deb,
she's the only person who loves me.

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,165
You've been the one
constantly good thing in my life.

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,609
There's something inside.
Holy frankenfuck! Snakes!

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,450
So it's begun?
Yes.

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,641
It's begun.
No!

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,810
Is this Doomsday?

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,122
I'm taking a lot of heat
on Doomsday.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,566
Are we making any headway?

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,331
I'm about to interview my top pick
for detective.

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,683
So far, our Doomsday killer
has given us three tableaus,

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,242
most likely referencing Revelation,
chapters eight through 10.

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,528
I think I found a new lead.
Who's this?

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,121
Latest and greatest intern
from my forensics class.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,527
The game is about homicide

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,803
but in my game,
you can be the serial killer.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,005
I think this is offensive.
Who would choose to be a serial killer?

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,369
Are you out of your mind?
You fucked a person of interest?

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,251
Maybe you're jealous.
This is a job of trust,

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,528
and I can't have a partner
I can't trust.

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,451
I don't know how to act,
what to do, who to hire.

28
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,041
You're too smart to think
this was gonna be easy.

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,566
Did you really think

30
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,206
Matthews made you Lieutenant
because you're ready?

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,203
It's all politics to get back at me.

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,522
Every time shit
hits the fan, I go to him.

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,767
He's your safe place.

34
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,123
You're making it sound like
I wanna be with him or something.

35
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,685
Well, do you?

36
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,524
You didn't really think you could foil
God's plan, did you?

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,167
- I have to stop him.
- What happened to saving him?

38
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,163
Travis' dark
passenger is a part of him.

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,926
He can't be saved from it
any more than I can from mine.

40
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,001
I think Travis is gonna kill again.

41
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,125
The eclipse is here, Travis.

42
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,442
This is not how it's supposed to be!

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,247
It is exactly as it should be.

44
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,365
Oh, God.

45
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,250
It's simple human nature to
keep little secrets about ourselves.

46
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,646
We all do it.

47
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,089
I dye my hair.

48
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,768
I watch internet pornography.

49
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,762
But what if your whole life
is a secret?

50
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,122
A lie.
How can I help you?

51
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,767
One economy class ticket, flight 449.

52
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,407
To Budapest.
Correct.

53
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,251
And exposing the truth
could destroy everything you are.

54
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,007
What do you do?

55
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,682
Run?
Oh, God.

56
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,206
Get the fuck away from the body.
Deb, it's me.

57
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,481
Who's on the altar?
Travis Marshall.

58
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,445
Dexter, what the fuck?

59
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,609
Oh, shit.
Talk to me.

60
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,361
Could you lower your gun?

61
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,446
Please?

62
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,164
I came to do one last forensics sweep
like you asked me to do,

63
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,207
Travis was here.
He came at me with his sword.

64
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,127
I fought him off.

65
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,727
I knocked him out.

66
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,764
How did he end up
wrapped in plastic on the altar?

67
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,129
I snapped.

68
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,084
You Snapped?

69
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,047
What the fuck does that mean?

70
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,091
There's been a lot of anger inside me
since Rita died,

71
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,080
and when I looked at Travis
and thought about everything he did,

72
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,367
I wanted him dead, so I killed him.

73
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,486
That still doesn't explain
why he's wrapped up like that.

74
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,049
I didn't even think about it.

75
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,971
I'm a forensics expert.

76
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,243
I guess it's just second nature
not to leave a trace.

77
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,886
Jesus, Dex.

78
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,962
Why the fuck didn't you call me?

79
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,969
I wasn't exactly
in the best state of mind.

80
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,324
Are you hurt?
No.

81
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,805
Physically, I'm okay.

82
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,930
Who are you calling?
The station.

83
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,248
I've gotta get everyone down here.
No.

84
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,800
Please wait.

85
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,480
Why?

86
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,926
How does this look?

87
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,002
Pretty fucking weird.
Exactly.

88
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,328
An investigation
could complicate our lives

89
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,723
more than either of us
are prepared to deal with.

90
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,721
But it was self-defence.

91
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,725
Yeah.

92
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,888
But it's pretty fucking weird.

93
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,768
I have to call this in.

94
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,603
You had a moment
of temporary insanity.

95
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,967
We can fix this.

96
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,487
How?

97
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,407
I'll get you the best fucking lawyer
in the city.

98
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,004
Even if I'm lucky enough to get off
due to temporary insanity,

99
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,841
they'll still put me in some
psych ward.

100
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,762
I'll lose my job, my career.

101
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,166
And probably even Harrison.

102
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,011
So what then?
Travis is dead.

103
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,446
Yes.
Nothing's gonna change that.

104
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,448
Maybe we should just get
rid of the body.

105
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,647
What?

106
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,605
I could put it in my car,
take it somewhere and dump it

107
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,962
where no one would ever find it.
No.

108
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,441
If I'm careful...
No. Use your head.

109
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,406
If you get caught with the body,
everything's ten times worse.

110
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,921
We're not moving
the fucking body anywhere.

111
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,043
Okay.

112
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,728
We make it look like a suicide.

113
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,127
Frustrated the world didn't end
like he predicted,

114
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,841
Travis committed ritual suicide
at the church altar,

115
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,691
stabbing himself with his sword.

116
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,287
Maybe.

117
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,211
But not before first
setting the church on fire.

118
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,126
Fire...

119
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,846
is biblical.

120
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,287
One last tableau.

121
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,165
And it'll erase any trace
that we were ever here.

122
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,850
How do we do that?

123
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,164
It would have to burn so fast.

124
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,362
Gasoline. There's a station nearby.

125
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,408
I'll go get a couple of gallons.
No, Deb, go home. I'll do it.

126
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,924
I know what I'm doing.
Bullshit.

127
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,442
Jesus, Debra.

128
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,002
He's a good doggy. Uh-huh.

129
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,010
Hey, Deb.
His name is Banjo.

130
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,000
Where did that dog come from?
The Millikans' dog had a litter.

131
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,680
I couldn't resist.
No dogs in this house ever.

132
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,803
But why?
Because.

133
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,288
Harry, look how much Debra loves...
End of discussion.

134
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,886
Dexter.

135
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,127
Don't even think about it.

136
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,411
I have to do whatever it takes
to keep Deb from the full truth.

137
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,490
I have to keep my secret safe.

138
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,211
Otherwise, my life, her life,
will never be the same.

139
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,569
Oh, fuck, Dexter, I don't know
if this was the right thing to do.

140
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,411
It's only a matter of time
before we get called back here.

141
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,802
We have to go.
Go where?

142
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,608
Go home.
I don't wanna be alone.

143
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,131
I don't want you to be alone.

144
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,766
Well, just follow me.
We can't stay here.

145
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,771
This is all wrong.

146
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,850
I should be on my boat right now
dumping the bags overboard.

147
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,042
I can't let this get away from me.

148
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,967
Morgan.

149
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,641
All right, everyone knows their jobs.

150
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,481
Let's do this.

151
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,804
The arson investigator said

152
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,731
the fire started somewhere
in the middle of the church.

153
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,366
The melted remains of a gas
can seem to confirm that.

154
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,001
I was also able to get
one fingerprint

155
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,322
that does give us
preliminary confirmation

156
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,010
that this is Travis Marshall.

157
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,562
Travis appears to have doused himself
in gasoline as well.

158
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,764
He then climbed up on the altar,
grabbed his sword at the hilt

159
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,362
and plunged it into his heart.

160
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,008
One final tableau.

161
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,489
He died instantly.
Please tell me he felt a little pain.

162
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,205
It makes sense.

163
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,966
World didn't end like he predicted
so he had to end his.

164
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,242
Good. Saves us the trouble
having to do it.

165
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,291
Cheer up, Lieutenant.
This is a big win.

166
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,363
Would have been better
to catch him alive.

167
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,723
Plastic.

168
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,930
After all he did? Fuck him.

169
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,202
Masuka. Masuka.

170
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,880
Is it possible to kill yourself
with a sword?

171
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,565
Oh, yeah, sure.

172
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,445
The ancient art of hara-kiri
has been well established

173
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,802
particularly amongst
my own ancestors

174
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,361
as a penance for
various embarrassing

175
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,086
and humiliating transgressions.

176
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,925
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

177
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,124
Miami has one less murderer
on the loose.

178
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,044
- Thank you.
- There's a large

179
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,248
press gathering outside.

180
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,806
This is a good opportunity for you
to make a statement.

181
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,849
Still a lot to be done in here.

182
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,850
She's not as comfortable
lying to the world as I am.

183
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,045
It's okay, Lieutenant. You can go.
We're just wrapping things up.

184
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,284
Go talk to them.
Come on. I'll be right behind you.

185
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,482
I'll sneak out back.
If the press sees me,

186
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,844
they'll only want to talk to me
and you're the hero this time.

187
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,886
But it's more heroic if you do it...

188
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,930
Hey.

189
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,369
Hey, you. Come here.

190
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,006
Would you make sure
this gets logged? Thanks.

191
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,602
Even if I put Deb in the
uncomfortable position of lying for me,

192
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,604
at least I've kept the bigger truth
from her.

193
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,202
It'll all be okay.

194
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,280
Oh, hey, Dexter.

195
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,691
What are you doing here?
Jamie's putting Harrison to bed.

196
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,370
I didn't wanna wake him.

197
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,602
You used my computer
without my permission?

198
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,328
I just wanted to check
the basketball scores.

199
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,522
I thought it would be okay.
It's not okay.

200
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,643
Okay, well, I'm really, really sorry.

201
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,010
I don't give a shit if you're sorry,
Louis. Never touch my things.

202
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,764
Louis, here you are.
Yeah, here he is.

203
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,203
What are you doing here? This
is Dexter's side of the apartment.

204
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,607
I didn't realise there were
different sides. I'm, like, super sorry.

205
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,007
- Is Harrison asleep?
- Yeah. He's out.

206
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,680
- You should go home.
- Okay.

207
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,124
Shit.

208
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,881
It'll all be okay.

209
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,045
You know, everyone acts
like Dexter's such a great guy,

210
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,090
but he's really kind of
a pompous jerk, don't you think?

211
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,321
Uh... No.

212
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,010
Come on.

213
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,441
He's all like,
"Don't touch my shit, man."

214
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,488
What a dick.
Louis.

215
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,806
What is your problem?

216
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,443
Dexter's my boss, okay?
And he happens to be very good to me.

217
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,047
I still don't understand
why you were on his side.

218
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,369
Well, I told you.
I just wanted to get some water.

219
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,686
Right.
Wha...?

220
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,923
You know, the more I get to know you,
the weirder and weirder you get.

221
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,927
And we go live
to this Breaking News 9 special report.

222
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,210
I can only speculate but I think it's fair
to say that Travis Marshall felt

223
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,483
the intense pressure of Miami Metro
zeroing in on him

224
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,371
and that led to his decision
to commit suicide.

225
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,922
Are you ruling out the
possibility that this was a murder?

226
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,762
- Hey, Mike.
- Just had a thought.

227
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,769
Where was his car?

228
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,201
Whose car?
Travis Marshall's.

229
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,003
His car wasn't found at the scene,
so how'd he get to the church?

230
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,003
I'm guessing that a man that was
about to stab himself in the heart

231
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,081
with a sword probably wouldn't see
a long walk as a big deal.

232
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,169
Probably right, but still...

233
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,249
Sure. Yeah. You should check it out.

234
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,641
I Will.

235
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,162
First thing in the morning.
Good night, Lt.

236
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,324
Need some help?
No. No, thank you.

237
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,481
It's okay. I can fix it.
Relax. I'm a cop.

238
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,371
Where's your lug wrench at?
No!

239
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,763
How were you so perfectly
prepared to kill Travis?

240
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,569
What do you mean?
The plastic wrap?

241
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,888
You just happened to have
that with you?

242
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,689
I found it in the storeroom.

243
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,120
What about the knives?

244
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,008
You said Travis came at you
with a sword.

245
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,249
Where did you get the knives?
There was like a whole roll of them.

246
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,841
Travis had them with him.
They were his knives.

247
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,441
I don't know where he got them from.

248
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,489
You weren't in your regular
work clothes.

249
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,890
You changed.
You had a rubber apron.

250
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,961
Plastic sleeves.

251
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,041
I'm just trying to put this together.

252
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,686
Deb, I'm sorry
I put you in this situation.

253
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,006
You look pretty stressed.
Yeah.

254
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,361
But...

255
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,084
You know, my job can get messy.

256
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,931
I always keep a change of clothes
in my car.

257
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,920
And the apron, all that other stuff,
is just part of my kit.

258
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,762
Every blood spatter guy's got them.

259
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,004
What about when you said,
"I know what I'm doing"?

260
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,722
When you tried to get me to go,
you said, "I know what I'm doing."

261
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,006
What did you mean?

262
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,607
I meant I work crime scenes
every day.

263
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,730
I know what people like me look for,
so I know what to cover up.

264
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,925
This doesn't feel right.

265
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,965
I know it doesn't.

266
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,806
Deb, I never meant to get you involved
in any of this.

267
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,090
But I am.

268
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,366
We gotta go to work.

269
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,923
What's wrong?

270
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,246
We had to give Banjo back.
I am so sorry, sweetheart.

271
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,165
I never should have gotten him
without talking to your dad.

272
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,291
- This is all my fault.
- I want Banjo back.

273
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,643
No. It's all my fault.

274
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,161
Deb.

275
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,601
Look, I made a huge mistake.
I admit it.

276
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,441
But other than saying I'm sorry again and
again, I don't know what else to say.

277
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,401
Morgan. What?

278
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,127
When?

279
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,010
Jesus, fuck.

280
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,689
That was Dispatch.
Mike's been shot.

281
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,325
Is he okay?
I don't know.

282
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,688
I'm right behind you.
Now, Dex.

283
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,603
Deb, I gotta find my keys,
put my bag together.

284
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,451
I'll get Dispatch
to text me the address.

285
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,290
I'll be two minutes behind you.

286
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,606
My getaway pack.

287
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,362
I don't want to run.

288
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,245
But if Deb doesn't let up,
that may be my only option.

289
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,483
Mike Anderson. One of our own.

290
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,086
Whoever did this to Mike
is gonna be very sorry.

291
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,004
- He'll be very fucking dead.
- Hey.

292
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,091
We do everything by the book.
We're cops, not killers.

293
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,888
But being a killer would
feel so very good right about now.

294
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,721
She suffered blunt force trauma
to the head.

295
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,685
From something narrow
and cylindrical.

296
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,646
- Steel pipe? Tyre iron?
- Yeah, something like that.

297
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,767
The first blow was the left side
of the head

298
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,887
and then three more blows to the top
much harder. She...

299
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,726
Her skull was fractured

300
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,361
and she haemorrhaged,
as evidenced by the blood

301
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,688
that's trickling from her ear.

302
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,047
When will she believe me?

303
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,208
What happens if she never does?

304
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,647
When do you think she bought it?

305
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,685
Rigor has set in. She hasn't been
moved from this trunk,

306
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,803
and judging from the lividity

307
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,207
and pooling on the right side
of her face,

308
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,691
I'd say eight to twelve hours ago.
Not long after we all left the church.

309
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,400
Yeah.
What a fucked up couple of days.

310
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,170
I couldn't agree with you more.

311
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,162
We're looking for one shooter
at a minimum.

312
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,768
The shooter hits this girl,
dumps her in the trunk, speeds off.

313
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,526
Gets a flat tyre.

314
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,327
He repays Mike's kindness by
shooting him and fleeing in Mike's car.

315
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,286
His car was found in an industrial park
near North West 52nd.

316
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,166
I've got people there. Start canvassing.
And here? Any witnesses?

317
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,167
None so far.

318
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,321
Maybe somebody saw something.

319
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,249
I'm on my way to talk to Mike's wife.

320
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,643
All of her family's in Chicago
and she's gonna need all our support.

321
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,921
Anything she needs.

322
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,401
Hopefully Dexter and I will win
the DNA lottery

323
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,648
because it looks
he wiped the car clean.

324
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,161
Nothing on prints, except for hers.

325
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,967
Well, judging by her attire
or lack of it, she was a stripper.

326
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,088
And on duty at the time of her death.

327
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,682
I've got an ID on the fingerprints.
A Kaja Soroka.

328
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,082
Same person this car's registered to.

329
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,044
We'll find out where she works.

330
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,689
The steering wheel, shifter,
door handles, seatbelt buckle,

331
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,166
they're all wiped clean.

332
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,807
But there's always one place
the turn signal.

333
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,363
You're clear.
Oh, fuck.

334
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,647
The road's clear.

335
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,205
Uh-huh.

336
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,206
Thank you.

337
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,246
Fuck.

338
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,801
Excuse me.

339
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,446
I need to see the files
on the Ice Truck Killer case.

340
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,166
- ROW F-17.
- Thank you.

341
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,087
Kaja Soroka was a Ukrainian national
here on a work visa.

342
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,329
She worked at the Fox Hole
gentleman's club in Pinecrest.

343
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,081
The same owner is listed as having
five other strip clubs in Miami.

344
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,686
Looked into them with Narcotics.
Figured they were

345
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,889
using the places to launder money
but we never got anywhere.

346
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,485
Let's get somewhere now.

347
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,648
Quinn and I
is gonna take the Fox Hole.

348
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,083
The rest of you split up
the rest of the clubs. Let's go.

349
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,928
All the prints belong to Miss
Soroka except the one from the turn signal.

350
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:01,491
But there aren't any matches
in Florida AFIS, FBI or DHS.

351
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,522
There's always Interpol.

352
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,808
I had this weird flashback
of being on Rudy's ta...

353
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,765
Brian's ta...
Whatever the fuck you wanna call him.

354
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,166
Your brother's table.

355
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,646
Sorry. That must have felt
not good for you.

356
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,165
It didn't.

357
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,367
But what bothers me about it
is that I was set up on that table

358
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,281
the same way Travis Marshall
was set up on the altar.

359
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,728
Deb...
I mean, how do you explain that?

360
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,846
I don't know, I was there too.

361
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,209
I pulled you off that table.
I was on that table.

362
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,569
I almost died on that table.

363
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,491
You would think that I would remember
every fucking detail.

364
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,484
But even I don't remember it
that clearly.

365
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,042
Dexter, you were somehow able to

366
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,006
perfectly duplicate
how he set everything up.

367
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,288
The same positioning.

368
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,444
The same amount of plastic wrap.
They are the same, Dexter.

369
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,042
They are exactly the same.

370
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,124
Because Brian was imitating me.

371
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,446
This is crazy, Deb. I know that.

372
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,483
It's crazy that I did what I did.

373
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,969
It's crazy that you just happened
to walk in and see me doing it.

374
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,891
I mean, what were you doing
in the church, anyway?

375
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,329
It was just...

376
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,967
I was just fucking checking to see
if everything was okay.

377
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,050
I'm sorry for all the questions.

378
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:52,690
I'm just... Dexter, I'm trying
to make sense of this.

379
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,564
Deb, it's not gonna make sense.

380
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,685
Did you find anything in the car?
No, not yet.

381
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,367
Give up, Deb. Give up
and just leave this alone.

382
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,362
We have a match.

383
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,969
Viktor Baskov.

384
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,127
When you're losing control
of your entire life,

385
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,322
it helps to focus on
what you're good at.

386
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,601
My little secret.

387
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,850
I shouldn't be doing a kill now.

388
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,888
The irony is that's the only way
I can maintain control,

389
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,202
the only way I can keep this
from Deb.

390
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,246
Someone packed in a hurry.

391
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,126
Blood.

392
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,484
And gunshot residue.
Looks like you're our man, Viktor.

393
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,964
How careless were you, Viktor?

394
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,886
One first class one-way ticket to Kiev,
Ukraine leaving in less than two hours.

395
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,565
Very careless.

396
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,047
How can I help you?

397
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,642
One economy class ticket,
flight 449.

398
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,123
To Budapest.
Correct.

399
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,211
That will be $1890, please,
Mr. Hartwell.

400
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,008
Dog track.
Lucky you.

401
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,521
Yeah, lucky me.

402
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,131
You're all set.
Thank you.

403
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,127
- Step through.
- Please wait.

404
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,402
Wait, sir. What are these for?
Diabetes.

405
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,648
I have a prescription
if you wanna see it.

406
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,529
Go ahead.

407
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,161
Hello, Viktor.

408
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,321
Right here, sweetheart.

409
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,601
- Kill the music.
- Good afternoon, everyone.

410
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,883
I'm Sergeant Batista
from Miami Metro Homicide.

411
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,528
We are investigating the suspected
homicide of one Kaja Soroka

412
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,929
as well as the homicide
of a Miami Metro police officer.

413
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,521
And no one is leaving
until they've been questioned.

414
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,087
Employees of the club
up against this wall.

415
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,964
The rest of you perverts, this wall.

416
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,851
- Is there a manager here?
- Yeah, I'm the manager.

417
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,485
- You heard him.
- Let's go.

418
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,769
George Novikov.
Oh, my God.

419
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,169
An employee and a pervert.
I don't know which wall you go to.

420
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,931
You know this guy?
Yeah, he was a low-level scumbag.

421
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,761
Now I guess he's a mid-level scumbag.
Nice to see you, Detective Quinn.

422
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,011
What can you tell me
about Miss Soroka?

423
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,208
Kaja wasn't the smartest girl
in the world.

424
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,606
No?

425
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,122
These girls come here from little
villages, still stinking of cow shit.

426
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,687
They think they're gonna land
some rich husband.

427
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,286
Hook up with the wrong guys,
end up over their heads.

428
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,962
Is that what you think happened?
I really have no idea what happened.

429
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,530
Look, I'm sorry Kaja's dead, you know?
She was a sweet kid.

430
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,206
And I'm sorry about
your police officer too.

431
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,203
Their deaths have nothing to do
with us.

432
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,961
We can start with you supplying me
with a list of all of your employees.

433
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,724
Sure.

434
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,651
Can I get a head count list
at the main bar?

435
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,171
Something cold to drink?

436
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,006
- Your name, please?
- Foxy Raven.

437
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,329
All right. Is that the name
your mother gave you?

438
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,171
And maybe you could show me
some form of ID.

439
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:02,250
I do not speak English.
No, of course you don't.

440
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,882
One of our guys found blood
outside the door.

441
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,650
Sir, I have your wheelchair.
I don't need a wheelchair... Uhn. Uhn.

442
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,849
It never matters your destination.

443
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,648
The smart traveller must be prepared
to make last-minute adjustments.

444
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,722
Lieutenant, you got a second?
Yeah, what's up?

445
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,208
We shut down the strip club questioned
everyone, but didn't get shit.

446
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,609
We know she worked last night.
She signed in at 10, never signed out.

447
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,526
We found blood in the parking lot
which we believe belongs to Soroka.

448
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,842
With that,
we still haven't gotten anywhere.

449
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,530
No one saw her leave?
No.

450
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,808
No one remembers any customers
she might have talked to.

451
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,402
No one remembers seeing her car
in the parking lot. No one saw shit.

452
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,565
She's a fucking ghost in a G-string.
Bullshit. She walked out of a club

453
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,688
in the middle of her shift.
Someone saw.

454
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,486
These places are mobbed up,
Russian, Ukrainian crime.

455
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,047
Strippers who are brought in,
they know not to talk.

456
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,449
How would you like us to proceed?
Shut down every club

457
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,250
every night until someone talks.

458
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,329
We're on it.
I'm gonna need more coffee.

459
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,726
Coffee truck?
No.

460
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,724
I already got so much caffeine
in my head, I can barely think.

461
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,611
You know what, you're not gonna
get anything done tonight.

462
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,371
Just go home.

463
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,688
It's been a very long,
very fucked-up day.

464
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,322
I'm too worked up to sleep
but I could use a drink.

465
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,005
Wanna knock one back

466
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,525
in Mike's honour?
Lead the way.

467
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,649
You coming, Lieutenant?
Rain check.

468
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,127
But slam a double for me.
Sure.

469
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,481
Good night.
Night.

470
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,205
Good night.

471
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,846
What's up, Lieutenant?
Any progress?

472
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,931
We know our shooter
was wearing size ten Prada shoes.

473
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,686
Very pricey.
We know he was right-handed.

474
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,805
So that narrows it down
to about 800 million people.

475
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,610
Dexter here?
No.

476
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,451
I told him I'd work late
if he came in early.

477
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,486
Scotch and whatever my friend
is having.

478
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,881
I'll have a vodka.

479
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,162
Don't you mean Shirley Temple?

480
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,725
What, I can't toast to Mike?

481
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,964
To Mike.
To Mike.

482
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,683
What if your union rep sees?
Aren't you in some kind of programme?

483
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,006
I start next week.

484
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,521
Good. Sooner you address
your problem, the better.

485
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,160
I'm tired of your shit.
Still breaking my balls?

486
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,727
You lose one girlfriend
and the wheels come off.

487
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,048
I'm a sensitive guy.
I lost two wives

488
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,844
and countless girlfriends.

489
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,730
I managed to keep my shit together.

490
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,123
I wish my life was more like yours.
You're living the fucking dream.

491
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,881
Keep it up. I'll put in for that transfer.
I don't care what the union says.

492
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,886
I'll make it happen.
I thought you put in for my transfer.

493
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,891
Didn't quite get around to it.

494
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,924
So you were just fucking with me?
You didn't want me to leave.

495
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,169
You were trying to get me to shape up.
A lot of good that did.

496
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,370
You still fucking love me.
Fuck you.

497
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,690
I try to help you and you go running
to your union rep like a little bitch.

498
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,567
That was weak.

499
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,808
What? Well, actually...

500
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,164
I plan on talking with him
as soon as I find out who he is.

501
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,125
What about this programme you're in?
That's bullshit.

502
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,448
You know I don't have
a drinking problem.

503
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,961
Or maybe that's just me in denial.
Who knows?

504
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,289
We may never get to the bottom of this.
Just deal with your shit.

505
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,684
Mike was a hundred times better cop
than we'll ever be.

506
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,044
I'll drink to that.

507
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,008
Hello, Viktor.

508
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,163
Where am I?

509
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,809
You're in a place
where things are forgotten.

510
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,400
Never to be used or seen
or touched again.

511
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,769
It seems fitting for a cop killer.

512
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,806
Not to dismiss Kaja Soroka.
She counts too.

513
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,607
Who are you?
Good question.

514
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,285
It all depends on who you ask.

515
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,205
Who sent you? Hmm?

516
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,640
You should not fuck with me.
I have very dangerous friends.

517
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,531
If you knew how many times
I've heard that over the years.

518
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,401
What do you want? Money?
I can get you a lot of money.

519
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,410
I've heard that a lot too.
Why are you doing this?

520
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,570
You want the long version?
That could take a couple of hours.

521
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,481
Short version.

522
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,608
Because I have to.

523
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,451
Because I need control.

524
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,646
I'm trying to make things go back
to the way they were.

525
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,886
You're crazy.

526
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,766
There's really no need
for name calling, Viktor.

527
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,720
Is there anything I can do
to keep you from killing me?

528
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,085
No.
Then get it over with.

529
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,606
Normally, I don't take orders.

530
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,970
But in this case...

531
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,408
# Catch my
breath I still love you #

532
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,242
How can I help you?

533
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,847
This is Isaak.

534
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,889
Viktor left on an evening flight.

535
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,129
He arrives in Kiev
at 5:25 p.m. your time.

536
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,807
Good. What about
the dead police officer?

537
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,126
That's still a problem
but they don't have shit on us, so...

538
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,371
I'll make it go away.
Good.

539
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:14,248
Ridding the world of people like
Viktor is the one thing I'm good at.

540
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,051
When I'm stressed
near to the breaking point, like now,

541
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,168
it centres me.

542
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,443
Maybe nothing has to change
with Deb.

543
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,245
Hello?

544
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:10,490
Hi, Jamie. ls Dexter there? It's Deb.
No, he's working late.

545
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,524
He's at work?
Mm-hm. Yeah.

546
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,167
He said with Mike's shooting and
everything, he might be there all night.

547
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,089
Oh, yeah, right.

548
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,326
Um... Does that happen a lot?

549
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,844
I mean, I know I should know his hours
and everything.

550
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,281
It's just that
I'm always juggling things, so...

551
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,370
Oh, yeah, he works crazy hours.

552
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,006
Lots of nights till 3, 4 a.m.

553
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,566
All right. Okay, thanks.
Want me to have him call you?

554
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,405
No. Um...

555
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,361
No, I'll see him at work tomorrow.

556
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,291
Okay.
Good night.

557
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,844
What's his name?
Banjo.

558
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,850
Are you okay?
No.

559
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,691
Why did Daddy
take the real Banjo away?

560
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,202
What did I do wrong?
You didn't do anything.

561
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,522
It's me. It's my fault.

562
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,722
Why? What did you do?

563
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:42,360
Dexter's allergic to dogs, sweetie.
That's why we can't have them.

564
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,809
Sorry.

565
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,084
What were you going to tell her?
The truth.

566
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,611
What is the truth?

567
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,003
That you got rid of the dog
because you thought I might kill it.

568
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,851
But I wouldn't.
I couldn't take that chance.

569
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,328
But what's more important
is that you mustn't ever

570
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,131
tell Debra the truth about yourself.

571
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,008
Why?
If you think she's upset now,

572
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:13,131
that's nothing compared to how
she'd feel if she learned what you are.

573
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,091
She'd be terrified.
But she loves me.

574
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,369
Dex, she loves
who she thinks you are.

575
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,731
If she ever saw the real you,
she'd never get over it.

576
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,284
Son, your mother and I
aren't gonna be around forever.

577
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,960
Someday Debra will be
all you have left.

578
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,367
You don't wanna lose her, do you?

579
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,282
My mistake was
stepping outside the code.

580
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,769
I should have killed Travis the instant
I met him rather than try to save him.

581
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,048
Compassion does not fit me.

582
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,291
- You're ready?
- Yes, I'm ready to join you.

583
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,962
But I can't. Not Deb.

584
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,927
No, you can't be a killer and a hero.

585
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,728
Ahem. Vincent.

586
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,923
You're working late.
Yeah, well, lots to do.

587
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,645
Everyone's doing double shifts.

588
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,646
Hmm. I know you're working on Mike's
case and that's top priority.

589
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,726
Wondering if anyone had a chance to go
through the evidence from the church.

590
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,403
Sorry. It's all in those boxes over there
but I'm kind of swamped here.

591
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,931
Of course.

592
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,687
Hey, does our forensics team ever take
blood slides at crime scenes?

593
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,168
No. If any of the evidence
is transportable, we bag it.

594
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,404
Otherwise, if it's blood,
we absorb into cotton squares,

595
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,045
then we bag it.
I see.

596
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,489
Only one person who ever worked at
Miami Metro ever took blood slides.

597
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,887
And that was?
Sergeant Doakes.

598
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:34,966
And that was only because of his
side gig as the Bay Harbor Butcher.

599
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,204
Right. Of course, Sergeant Doakes.

600
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,809
Thank you.

601
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,406
None of us want
to be fully revealed,

602
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,167
all our faults and weaknesses
laid bare for the world to see.

603
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,451
All the more reason to make sure
I never again stray

604
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,001
from what Harry taught me.

605
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,882
Did you kill all these people?

606
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,326
I did.

607
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,647
Are you...

608
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,324
Are you a serial killer?

609
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,482
Yes.
