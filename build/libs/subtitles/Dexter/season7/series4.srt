Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

6
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,427
Who is Dexter Morgan?

7
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:53,997
He's just a jerk who works
for Miami Metro Homicide.

8
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:56,099
Now can I please go?

9
00:01:56,134 --> 00:01:57,767
Yes.

10
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,004
So you're not interested
in alcohol

11
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,605
or looking at naked women?

12
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:04,373
You may be
in the wrong place.

13
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:05,908
I'm taking out the trash

14
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:08,176
that would otherwise
be left to putrefy.

15
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,278
There is a legal system
for that.

16
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:12,380
If it worked as well
as you think it does,

17
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:14,015
I wouldn't be so busy.

18
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:17,051
I'm just gonna get
a swab from your cheek.

19
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:23,757
You do this for a living?

20
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,527
Well, I hate it,
but I get it...

21
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:28,795
What you do.

22
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:31,029
But what I don't understand

23
00:02:31,064 --> 00:02:32,997
are the blood slides.

24
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:34,265
They're trophies.

25
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:35,866
They're like
Speltzer's earrings.

26
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:37,968
I'm nothing like Speltzer.

27
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:44,339
My bosses at the club,

28
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:46,574
they ordered me
to get close to you.

29
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:48,476
These men are dangerous.

30
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,612
I-I can't go back to them
with nothing.

31
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:54,548
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

32
00:03:04,124 --> 00:03:06,192
- He's gone.
- Motherfucker...

33
00:03:06,226 --> 00:03:07,226
He has a girl in here.

34
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:09,963
We have to find her.

35
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:13,165
She's dead.

36
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:23,675
Just when it seems like

37
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:24,843
Deb and I are
making progress,

38
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:27,412
we take a left turn.

39
00:03:27,446 --> 00:03:30,281
I showed her a monster,
Ray Speltzer.

40
00:03:30,315 --> 00:03:33,717
The killer who chased his victim
through a maze.

41
00:03:33,752 --> 00:03:36,053
I could have prevented
that murder.

42
00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:39,956
And Deb accepts that.

43
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,158
But she hasn't accepted me--

44
00:03:42,193 --> 00:03:46,529
What I am.

45
00:03:46,563 --> 00:03:49,665
And I'm not sure
she ever will.

46
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,610
Yep.

47
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,186
I'm getting nothing.

48
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,688
You?

49
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,023
No.

50
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:20,126
That maze man--he's good.

51
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:22,929
He knows what he's doing.

52
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,631
My hat's off
to any killer good enough

53
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,100
not to leave any DNA behind
at a murder scene.

54
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,236
Plenty of his DNA
in this place though.

55
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,772
Well, if this cemetery
was his office,

56
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:35,942
it's like this place was
his break room.

57
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,779
Something was here.

58
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,349
Something special,
like a trophy maybe?

59
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:44,717
From one of his victims.

60
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:47,453
Killers hate to leave
their trophies behind.

61
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,489
Well, that means Speltzer
stopped by here

62
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:50,623
after he killed that girl.

63
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:53,660
But there's none of her DNA
here.

64
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:56,296
No blood,
no fibers, no hair.

65
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,800
No reception.

66
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,412
Speltzer is loose
in the world,

67
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:13,814
and Deb will do everything
in her power to find him.

68
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:15,049
But will
she and I be able

69
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,818
to find our way back
to each other?

70
00:05:34,903 --> 00:05:37,805
Deb...

71
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,842
will you...

72
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:47,182
will you be mine?

73
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,914
Morning.

74
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:53,949
Coffee.
Now.

75
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:07,763
- Rita...
- Another left turn.

76
00:07:07,798 --> 00:07:09,265
Trinity killed her.

77
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:13,335
Yes.

78
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,270
Yes.
Why?

79
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:18,540
She didn't
fit the pattern at all.

80
00:07:18,574 --> 00:07:22,043
Because I was coming
after him.

81
00:07:22,078 --> 00:07:24,011
So while
we were hunting trinity,

82
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:25,613
you were too.

83
00:07:25,647 --> 00:07:27,982
I figured out who he was
before you did.

84
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:29,651
And didn't help us
fucking get him?

85
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:32,153
He knew who I was,
where I lived,

86
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:34,522
that I had a family.

87
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:35,957
I was trying
to protect them.

88
00:07:35,992 --> 00:07:38,393
You wanted
to fucking kill him.

89
00:07:38,427 --> 00:07:40,996
And I did.

90
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,999
When?

91
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:45,567
He's dead.
That's what matters.

92
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:46,835
But when?

93
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,538
I took care of him.

94
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:51,207
Did you love her?

95
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:53,042
- Why would you ask me that?
- Because I suddenly

96
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:54,244
have no idea
what's the truth

97
00:07:54,278 --> 00:07:58,448
and what's a fucking lie
with you anymore.

98
00:07:58,482 --> 00:07:59,649
I loved her.

99
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:01,384
If you were so concerned
about your family,

100
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:03,153
then why were you going
after trinity?

101
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:05,355
Is that what
a loving husband does?

102
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:06,957
Are you even
capable of love?

103
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:11,394
I love you.

104
00:08:11,428 --> 00:08:12,862
How?

105
00:08:12,897 --> 00:08:15,765
How can you love me
and also love to--

106
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,369
It's how I've lived
my whole life.

107
00:08:19,404 --> 00:08:21,438
Before the moment
you walked into that church,

108
00:08:21,473 --> 00:08:25,509
did you ever question
the way I felt about you?

109
00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:27,711
Why is it any different now?
Why?

110
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:31,281
Jesus, Dexter.

111
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:36,420
Morgan.

112
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:37,688
Okay.

113
00:08:38,923 --> 00:08:43,627
It was Batista.
They found Speltzer.

114
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,398
A security guard spotted him
at the scrapyard,

115
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:49,433
and he had the good sense
not to try and be a hero.

116
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:51,635
It took four officers
to take Speltzer down.

117
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:52,836
He put up one hell
of a fight.

118
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,070
They came close
to shooting him.

119
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:55,738
If Speltzer had a weapon,
they would've.

120
00:08:55,773 --> 00:08:57,073
Speltzer is a weapon.

121
00:08:57,107 --> 00:08:58,241
He was mine.

122
00:08:58,275 --> 00:08:59,942
He hasn't asked
for a lawyer yet.

123
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:00,943
This is your one shot.

124
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:02,645
A confession
is our only shot.

125
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,380
He was wearing a mask
when he came at me,

126
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:05,814
so I couldn't make an I.D.
that would stick.

127
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:07,916
I can't believe his DNA wasn't
at the crime scene.

128
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:09,584
Masuka and I
went over it twice.

129
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:10,886
Yeah,
Dexter and I,

130
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,888
we checked Speltzer's
mausoleum man-cave

131
00:09:12,922 --> 00:09:14,623
for evidence
of his victim there,

132
00:09:14,658 --> 00:09:16,158
but no luck.

133
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:17,560
I mean, Dexter and I
can't make evidence appear,

134
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:18,694
you know.

135
00:09:18,729 --> 00:09:19,795
If you don't get
a confession,

136
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,297
you won't get Speltzer.

137
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:22,965
Are you two ready?

138
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:25,201
Fuck, yes.

139
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:30,272
That's Dexter Morgan.

140
00:09:30,306 --> 00:09:32,508
His face.
It looks familiar.

141
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:35,411
I put everything Jurg
dug up on Morgan in there.

142
00:09:35,445 --> 00:09:36,678
He's not a cop.

143
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:39,148
He's a lab rat.
Blood splatter.

144
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:40,416
It's spatter.

145
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,118
Blood spatter.
Whatever.

146
00:09:43,153 --> 00:09:45,020
He's from Miami.
Normal guy.

147
00:09:45,055 --> 00:09:47,289
Except his wife was murdered
by a serial killer

148
00:09:47,323 --> 00:09:49,123
a few years back.

149
00:09:49,158 --> 00:09:50,825
The man we killed
on the boat?

150
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:53,160
Louis Greene.

151
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:57,731
He was an intern
for Miami Metro.

152
00:09:57,766 --> 00:10:01,101
The boat's owner,
this Dexter Morgan.

153
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:08,474
He works
for Miami Metro too.

154
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:10,009
Viktor's death--

155
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:12,312
is it payback for killing
that detective?

156
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,181
Viktor fucked us
real good here.

157
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:16,150
Of all the people
he could've shot,

158
00:10:16,184 --> 00:10:18,185
it had to be a fucking cop.

159
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,853
So it's Viktor's fault
he's dead?

160
00:10:19,888 --> 00:10:21,388
Uh, yeah.

161
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:23,490
He was a loose Cannon.
Never listened.

162
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:24,858
At least not to me.

163
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:27,361
Everything was going great
until he showed up in Miami.

164
00:10:27,395 --> 00:10:30,498
Viktor was a good man.

165
00:10:30,532 --> 00:10:32,333
He was loyal.

166
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:34,435
He was committed.

167
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,306
And he was here to do
what you couldn't.

168
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:41,777
Keep the Colombians from taking
over our traffic!

169
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,652
Fuck.

170
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:53,722
Here we go again.

171
00:10:59,562 --> 00:11:02,864
Good afternoon, everyone.
I'm Detective Quinn.

172
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll be your official
pain in the ass for the day.

173
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:06,568
Could we get that music
turned off?

174
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:08,036
Ladies, to the left,

175
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,337
customers to the right.

176
00:11:09,372 --> 00:11:11,373
Keep it behind the bar.

177
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:14,476
Ma'am, I need you to go ahead
and stand over there.

178
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:15,544
Officer.

179
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:16,779
It's detective.

180
00:11:16,813 --> 00:11:19,982
Detective Quinn.

181
00:11:21,452 --> 00:11:24,187
Do not tell me
you are fucking her.

182
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:26,722
No.
What makes you think that?

183
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:31,093
You're not the only one
who's a detective.

184
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:32,661
You really think a stripper's
a good idea?

185
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:38,033
No, it's a horrible idea.

186
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:41,303
Seriously, how long
is this gonna go on?

187
00:11:41,337 --> 00:11:43,372
I'm thinking every day

188
00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:45,674
until we lock up
Mike Anderson's shooter.

189
00:11:47,276 --> 00:11:48,543
Or you could say a number,

190
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:50,745
and it'll be just like
old times.

191
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,814
You know,
leave your car unlocked,

192
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:54,049
you'll find some cash,

193
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,151
maybe some blow.

194
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:58,586
And all this goes away.

195
00:11:58,621 --> 00:12:01,390
I don't know
what you're talking about.

196
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:04,427
Get the fuck out of my face.

197
00:12:13,603 --> 00:12:15,404
None of this
makes any sense.

198
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:17,806
Viktor's dead.
They got him!

199
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:21,143
Not everyone
at Miami Metro knows this.

200
00:12:21,178 --> 00:12:24,113
Otherwise,
they wouldn't be here.

201
00:12:24,147 --> 00:12:28,651
Maybe this Morgan and Greene
were working alone.

202
00:12:28,685 --> 00:12:30,553
Well, why the fuck would
these two assholes

203
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:31,621
cover up Viktor's murder?

204
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:33,589
I believe Dexter Morgan
knows why.

205
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:34,624
Just say the word.

206
00:12:34,658 --> 00:12:35,825
I'll take him out.

207
00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:36,826
No.

208
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,094
I want to talk to him.

209
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:39,495
Talk?

210
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,930
What are we supposed to do
in the meantime?

211
00:12:40,964 --> 00:12:43,866
We got two boats waiting
to drop off our supply,

212
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,270
even though we can't move
what we already have.

213
00:12:47,304 --> 00:12:51,441
We are bleeding money.

214
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,352
The bartender, Alex.
One of ours, isn't he?

215
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:05,690
Yeah.

216
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:07,726
So let's give them
what they want.

217
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:13,899
For my money,

218
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:17,970
four on one is not
really a fair fight.

219
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:19,872
I did a little boxing myself
back in the day.

220
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:21,707
I didn't take on four cops,

221
00:13:21,741 --> 00:13:24,343
but I, you know--
I held my own.

222
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:29,448
You don't want to chitchat.
I get that.

223
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:31,417
Here's the thing though.

224
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:33,686
My Lieutenant
is gonna come in here

225
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,355
and say that she saw you
at the maze

226
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,458
where that waitress died.

227
00:13:39,493 --> 00:13:40,660
I don't know
what you're talking about.

228
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,496
Right. Guy like you
was probably at the gym.

229
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,498
But she's a woman.

230
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,768
They get shit wrong
all the time.

231
00:13:48,803 --> 00:13:52,572
And this one, man,
she's my boss.

232
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:54,608
If you can believe that.

233
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:56,376
I have to fucking answer

234
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,046
to her skinny ass
every day.

235
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,015
And she's always squawking
at me, you know.

236
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,650
Her beak goes
"squawk, squawk,

237
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:06,253
squawk, squawk, squawk,
squawk, squawk."

238
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:08,922
To tell you the truth,
I envy you.

239
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:11,225
I've been wanting
to pop my Lieutenant

240
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,793
in that beak of hers
for years.

241
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:19,266
She's dying
to get a shot at you.

242
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,036
Should we let her?
Could be fun.

243
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,873
Right?

244
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:29,510
All right.

245
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,385
Nice job in there.

246
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,120
He's all ready for you.

247
00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:40,655
Deb.

248
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:42,423
Good luck.

249
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:48,262
He was mine, but Deb needs this
more than me.

250
00:14:48,297 --> 00:14:50,598
And she needs to get him
her way.

251
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:52,500
Remember me?

252
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:54,335
I saw you just
the other night.

253
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,439
That is some maze
that you built.

254
00:14:57,473 --> 00:15:01,243
What is it for, Ray?

255
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:03,712
Are you sure
you don't remember me?

256
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:10,319
Maybe I'm not pretty enough.

257
00:15:10,353 --> 00:15:13,222
Your mom sure was pretty.

258
00:15:13,256 --> 00:15:15,825
She died
a few years ago, right?

259
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:20,329
Cast a long shadow,
I bet.

260
00:15:20,364 --> 00:15:21,831
Hard for any girl
to measure up to those looks,

261
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:25,369
but you keep trying,
don't you?

262
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:28,839
What do you think about
the girls that go home with you?

263
00:15:28,873 --> 00:15:30,107
That they're stupid?

264
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:32,309
Easy?

265
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:35,645
That they're whores?

266
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,615
They'd have to be, right?

267
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:39,483
To go home with you,

268
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:42,453
take their clothes
off for you.

269
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:44,689
Girls like that are vulgar.

270
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:49,660
But girls like that,
sure do look like your mom.

271
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:51,396
So I have to wonder...

272
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,397
Your mom was so pretty.

273
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:55,800
She probably had
a lot of admirers, right?

274
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:57,035
Men who would go home
with her

275
00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:01,539
and watch her
take her clothes off.

276
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:04,609
And then take her any way
that they wanted her?

277
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:06,844
Shut up.

278
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:12,049
There were many ways
to break a body down.

279
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:15,586
You could hear it,
couldn't you?

280
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,622
You could hear her through
those thin walls

281
00:16:17,656 --> 00:16:19,924
that the two of you
shared.

282
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:23,595
You could hear how much
she loved getting fucked

283
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:25,030
by all those men.

284
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:27,098
You could hear
her kissing them,

285
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:29,801
all the things that
she might do with her mouth,

286
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:32,603
that same mouth
she would kiss you with.

287
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:36,273
But be honest, Ray.

288
00:16:36,308 --> 00:16:40,311
You kind of liked it,
didn't you?

289
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:42,413
Weren't you kind of wishing

290
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:44,214
that it was you inside her?

291
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,851
I should've killed you like
I killed that other bitch!

292
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:49,620
Go to hell.

293
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:52,890
We got him.

294
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:01,432
Way to go, Lieutenant.

295
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:03,934
- All right.
- Good job.

296
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:08,038
Hey, Deb.

297
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:09,106
Jamie said she was good

298
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,941
to watch Harrison
till late tonight

299
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:13,944
if you want
to grab a drink or something.

300
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:20,417
I thought you'd be
in the mood to celebrate.

301
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:22,085
I'm really glad
we got Speltzer.

302
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,087
But celebrate?
No.

303
00:17:24,122 --> 00:17:27,491
Melanie Garrett is still dead.

304
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:29,460
But you got Speltzer.

305
00:17:29,494 --> 00:17:30,960
He'll never hurt anyone again.

306
00:17:30,995 --> 00:17:32,495
Well, outside of prison.

307
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:36,266
Dexter.

308
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,468
I've been thinking a lot
about Rita--

309
00:17:38,503 --> 00:17:40,670
about how she died.

310
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:43,640
She died because of you.

311
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:46,476
Because you were selfish.

312
00:17:46,511 --> 00:17:48,245
You have a son.

313
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,113
Harrison is three years old.

314
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:51,481
Someone needs to protect him.

315
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:52,649
I do.

316
00:17:52,684 --> 00:17:57,420
Someone needs
to protect him from you.

317
00:17:57,455 --> 00:17:59,756
He could go live
with Astor and Cody,

318
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,025
with their grandparents
in Orlando.

319
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:04,561
I am a good father.
I am the right person--

320
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:09,465
the only person who can
and should raise my son.

321
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,034
Who, like me,
lost his mother.

322
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:13,036
It is not fair of you

323
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:16,773
to expose a child
to your life...

324
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:19,810
Choices.

325
00:18:19,844 --> 00:18:23,280
You have to decide!
Your desires or--

326
00:18:23,314 --> 00:18:24,281
No, I don't.

327
00:18:24,315 --> 00:18:25,381
You said it yourself,
Dexter,

328
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,616
that you can't stop,

329
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,451
that you don't want to stop.

330
00:18:28,485 --> 00:18:30,787
And if you keep doing this,

331
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:33,556
you're like
a fucking magnet.

332
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,727
Bad shit is gonna find you.

333
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:39,696
And if that happens,
I'll handle it.

334
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:46,570
What if you had been
three minutes later

335
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:48,638
to Speltzer's fucking maze?

336
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:49,739
But I wasn't.

337
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:54,343
You were too late for Rita.

338
00:18:54,378 --> 00:18:57,446
I should have killed Trinity
the first time I saw him.

339
00:18:57,481 --> 00:18:58,747
That's the mistake I made.

340
00:18:58,782 --> 00:18:59,781
That's the mistake
that you made?

341
00:18:59,816 --> 00:19:00,949
Yes!

342
00:19:00,983 --> 00:19:02,617
And I will never,
from this moment on--

343
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:04,019
do you hear me?

344
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:06,021
I will never ever
make that mistake again.

345
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:08,222
It is not in your control.

346
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:12,259
Everything is
in my control.

347
00:19:22,503 --> 00:19:24,170
I am not giving up my son.

348
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:45,358
Mr. Sirko.

349
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,327
George.

350
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:48,628
I wasn't expecting visitors.

351
00:19:48,662 --> 00:19:49,862
That's all right.

352
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,130
We don't stand
on ceremony here.

353
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:52,599
Have a seat, Alex.

354
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,300
You have
a beautiful family.

355
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:56,936
Thank you.

356
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,104
That is why I came here.

357
00:19:58,138 --> 00:20:01,707
They are still in Kursk.

358
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,377
Your son and daughter,
what are their names?

359
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:09,449
My son's Zakhary and my girl,
her name's Yulia.

360
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:11,451
They're twins, yes?
How old?

361
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:14,154
Five.
Their birthday's in April.

362
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:15,789
Wow, five.

363
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:18,457
That's the best age, huh?

364
00:20:18,492 --> 00:20:22,528
Learning to read, walking,
seeing the world,

365
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:24,896
and yet, they still want
to be held.

366
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:27,232
You're probably wondering why
I stopped by.

367
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:29,701
Well, you see--

368
00:20:29,735 --> 00:20:30,969
tell me...

369
00:20:31,003 --> 00:20:33,605
How much money do you send back
to Kursk each month?

370
00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:35,607
From your job
at the Fox Hole?

371
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:38,344
$750.

372
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:41,447
I take out only my rent,
my food,

373
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:43,349
some money for my car.

374
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:45,319
A sacrifice for you,
I'm sure.

375
00:20:45,353 --> 00:20:46,920
Yeah, but still,

376
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,456
it's not very much.

377
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:54,260
What if your family could have
a lot of money?

378
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,429
Security.

379
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,265
And college
for Zakhary and Yulia?

380
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,167
You'd want that for them.

381
00:21:01,202 --> 00:21:04,404
I would give anything
for them.

382
00:21:04,438 --> 00:21:06,006
That pleases me.

383
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,244
Because that is why
I came by here today.

384
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:12,312
To ask you a favor, Alex.

385
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:13,980
Yes, of course.
Anything.

386
00:21:14,015 --> 00:21:16,717
I have a problem.

387
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:19,887
One of my men killed
a police officer,

388
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:22,389
and I have
to give the police a suspect

389
00:21:22,423 --> 00:21:23,890
so they'll stop harassing us.

390
00:21:23,925 --> 00:21:25,659
And that suspect is you.

391
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:29,897
But I didn't kill anyone.

392
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:31,332
Sure, you did.

393
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:33,767
I want you to write a note.

394
00:21:33,801 --> 00:21:36,035
Pen, paper?

395
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:42,274
This is what
I want you to write.

396
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:44,543
"Kaja.

397
00:21:44,577 --> 00:21:49,448
"I cannot live
with what I have done.

398
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:52,118
I'm very sorry."

399
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:57,391
I will take care
of your family now.

400
00:21:57,425 --> 00:22:01,963
Zakhary and Yulia
will want for nothing.

401
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:06,534
That's for you.

402
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:08,069
It's the gun that killed
the police officer.

403
00:22:08,103 --> 00:22:12,740
What do I do with it?

404
00:22:12,774 --> 00:22:16,044
Bang.

405
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:21,016
Look at your
children's faces.

406
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,385
They're looking at you.

407
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:25,454
Wanting you to give them
the best life

408
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:27,156
this world has to offer.

409
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,793
You will do this for them.

410
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:34,263
And if I don't?

411
00:22:34,298 --> 00:22:35,831
We'll kill you anyway.

412
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:41,003
And throw your wife
and fucking kids in the river.

413
00:22:41,037 --> 00:22:42,271
No need for threats.

414
00:22:42,305 --> 00:22:44,373
We're all friends here.

415
00:22:44,408 --> 00:22:49,678
But I think you understand
the situation.

416
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,797
You won't feel a thing.

417
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,236
It'll be quick,

418
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,539
like turning off a light.

419
00:23:37,261 --> 00:23:40,062
For my family?

420
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,145
Hannah McKay.

421
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:58,780
She spent six years in juvie

422
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:01,583
after pleading guilty to being
Wayne Randall's accomplice.

423
00:24:01,617 --> 00:24:05,486
She always claimed she was just
another one of his victims.

424
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,056
Wayne called her the Robin
to his Batman,

425
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,924
but with better legs.

426
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:14,261
Dexter Morgan.

427
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:15,696
You look a little lost.

428
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,266
Well, I haven't been inside
a police station

429
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,700
in 15 years.

430
00:24:19,735 --> 00:24:21,870
Still smells the same,

431
00:24:21,904 --> 00:24:24,272
like fast food and sweat.

432
00:24:24,307 --> 00:24:28,177
Well, hospitality isn't
exactly our main concern.

433
00:24:28,211 --> 00:24:30,513
I heard the sheriff's
department found the body

434
00:24:30,547 --> 00:24:32,114
of one of Wayne's victims.

435
00:24:32,148 --> 00:24:33,715
Yeah, they went back
one last time

436
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,585
after Wayne...died.

437
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,789
And expanded the perimeter.

438
00:24:40,824 --> 00:24:41,990
Is that what
you're doing here?

439
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:45,093
To help us find
the other bodies Wayne buried?

440
00:24:45,128 --> 00:24:48,831
My lawyer said
it was for the best.

441
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,867
There's a rumor
going around

442
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:54,303
that you were the last person
to talk to Wayne

443
00:24:54,337 --> 00:24:58,273
before he...

444
00:24:58,308 --> 00:25:01,310
Died.

445
00:25:01,344 --> 00:25:03,345
His last words
were about you.

446
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,648
Oh.

447
00:25:06,683 --> 00:25:07,916
He said something about

448
00:25:07,951 --> 00:25:10,986
every day being like
an unwrapped present.

449
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,922
Yeah. Yeah.

450
00:25:13,957 --> 00:25:18,894
I remember when he got
that fortune from a cookie.

451
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:22,832
You two didn't
stay in contact?

452
00:25:22,866 --> 00:25:25,669
Too painful.

453
00:25:27,972 --> 00:25:30,174
Where were you and Wayne
going anyway?

454
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,475
Was there a plan?

455
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:34,011
Not much of one at first.

456
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:36,681
We were just trying to get out
of Clopton, Alabama,

457
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:38,116
which isn't even a town.

458
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:40,252
It's an intersection
and a cemetery.

459
00:25:40,286 --> 00:25:43,021
But somewhere around Sarasota,

460
00:25:43,056 --> 00:25:44,790
a plan did begin to form.

461
00:25:44,824 --> 00:25:46,859
Argentina.

462
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:49,127
We were gonna go find
a farm in Argentina

463
00:25:49,162 --> 00:25:50,796
and settle down.

464
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:53,698
What?

465
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:56,000
We were living
on farms in Alabama.

466
00:25:56,035 --> 00:25:58,002
Like, somehow,
it would all be so different

467
00:25:58,037 --> 00:26:02,040
in South America.

468
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:06,945
Do you miss him?

469
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:11,282
I miss the way I felt with him
on the road.

470
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:12,917
That life was just beginning,

471
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:15,653
and that anything--

472
00:26:15,687 --> 00:26:18,956
anything was possible.

473
00:26:20,658 --> 00:26:23,427
You know the feeling?

474
00:26:28,732 --> 00:26:30,701
No.

475
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:36,039
It's my lawyer.

476
00:26:36,073 --> 00:26:39,042
I'm sure he's wondering
where I got lost to.

477
00:26:55,528 --> 00:26:57,128
We have a big problem.

478
00:27:05,171 --> 00:27:06,204
What's the problem?

479
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:07,339
Watch the Miranda.

480
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:09,041
Put him on the fucking car!

481
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:11,543
You know how this goes.

482
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:13,712
If you want an attorney,
we'll get one for you.

483
00:27:13,746 --> 00:27:15,713
Even if can't afford one.

484
00:27:15,748 --> 00:27:17,415
Do you understand your rights?

485
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,251
Huh?
Do you understand?

486
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:23,854
- Say yes.
- Did you guys see that?

487
00:27:23,889 --> 00:27:26,290
Looks like a "yes" to me.

488
00:27:26,324 --> 00:27:28,993
Fucking cock sucker.

489
00:27:30,062 --> 00:27:31,662
They never got
a verbal confirmation

490
00:27:31,696 --> 00:27:32,964
that Speltzer understood
his rights.

491
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:33,965
No.

492
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:34,966
But Speltzer
fucking nodded.

493
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,834
He didn't say, "yes."

494
00:27:36,868 --> 00:27:39,103
And at Speltzer's arraignment
this morning,

495
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:40,738
his P.D. was able
to make the case--

496
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:41,839
Don't.

497
00:27:41,874 --> 00:27:42,974
That because Speltzer

498
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:43,974
at one point knocked
unconscious,

499
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:45,443
it is entirely possible

500
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:47,612
that he did not understand
his rights,

501
00:27:47,646 --> 00:27:50,115
that it wasn't a nod, that
it was a temporary blackout.

502
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:51,883
And the judge fucking
bought that?

503
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:55,487
The judge threw his confession
out of court.

504
00:27:55,521 --> 00:27:56,521
He walked.

505
00:27:56,555 --> 00:27:58,557
- When?
- Two hours ago.

506
00:27:58,591 --> 00:27:59,725
Motherfucker.

507
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:01,927
And apparently,
Speltzer's planning

508
00:28:01,962 --> 00:28:03,529
to file a lawsuit
against us.

509
00:28:03,563 --> 00:28:05,898
Use of excessive force?

510
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:08,268
I don't believe this.

511
00:28:08,302 --> 00:28:11,371
So all that's left to do is--
is what?

512
00:28:11,405 --> 00:28:13,406
Wait around till
he kills someone else?

513
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,075
There's nothing else
we can do.

514
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:17,244
But there is something
I can do.

515
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,612
Fuck that.

516
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:21,448
Fuck all of this.

517
00:28:30,358 --> 00:28:31,725
The bartender
from the Fox Hole

518
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,295
blew his brains out
last night.

519
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:38,365
Why don't
they wear uniforms?

520
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,801
There's no respect.

521
00:28:42,904 --> 00:28:45,072
You'd never know
they were police.

522
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,483
Unless you knew
who you were looking for.

523
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:10,763
We got a single gunshot wound
to the right temple.

524
00:29:10,797 --> 00:29:13,533
What appears to be GSR
on the right hand.

525
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:15,801
It was through and through,
based on the height

526
00:29:15,836 --> 00:29:17,236
of the bullet in the wall.

527
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,071
Alex was sitting at the table

528
00:29:19,106 --> 00:29:20,606
when he put his gun
to his head.

529
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,274
We got a White Russian
on ice.

530
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:23,876
Very funny.

531
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:27,213
I'll have you know I have
a major following on Twitter.

532
00:29:28,748 --> 00:29:29,982
This gun is a 9-mil.

533
00:29:30,016 --> 00:29:32,852
Same type of weapon used
on Mike Anderson.

534
00:29:32,886 --> 00:29:34,687
I'll go to ballistics
and run this through.

535
00:29:34,721 --> 00:29:37,490
And confirm this turd
is our shooter.

536
00:29:38,992 --> 00:29:41,961
But I know that Viktor
killed Mike Anderson.

537
00:29:41,996 --> 00:29:44,731
Why would Alex
take the fall for him?

538
00:29:44,765 --> 00:29:46,733
Unless there's someone
at the club

539
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:48,267
who wants
the investigation to end

540
00:29:48,302 --> 00:29:50,503
as much as Miami Metro does.

541
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,140
Quinn, read that note again.

542
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:54,908
"Kaja, I cannot live with what
I have done.

543
00:29:54,942 --> 00:29:56,876
I am very sorry."

544
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,878
- Sorry to Kaja?
- Yeah.

545
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,513
I mean, it makes sense.

546
00:30:00,547 --> 00:30:03,149
It's obvious that this Alex
Dubrozny had feelings for her,

547
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:04,718
and she was
in love with Tony.

548
00:30:04,752 --> 00:30:06,419
Which probably didn't sit
very well with him.

549
00:30:06,454 --> 00:30:08,688
So he kills her,
kills Tony.

550
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,390
And Mike was just
in the wrong fucking place

551
00:30:10,424 --> 00:30:11,391
at the wrong fucking time.

552
00:30:11,425 --> 00:30:12,692
I mean, this guy still
has pictures up

553
00:30:12,726 --> 00:30:14,361
of his kids, his wife.

554
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,462
Yeah.

555
00:30:15,496 --> 00:30:16,864
He probably feels horrible

556
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,399
having to look at her face
all fucking day.

557
00:30:18,433 --> 00:30:21,035
That's just it.
He doesn't have to.

558
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,670
Take the pictures down.
Put them away.

559
00:30:22,705 --> 00:30:24,405
Leaving the pictures up
just tells me that

560
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,406
he still cares for them.

561
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,507
He's a guy.

562
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:27,541
Once something's up
on the wall,

563
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:28,943
why bother even
taking it down?

564
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:30,244
- I don't know.
- What don't you know?

565
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:32,246
I don't know
if it all adds up.

566
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,181
Well, look.
We'll talk to the neighbors.

567
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:35,616
See if they saw anyone
coming in,

568
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,184
or out of Alex's apartment
last night

569
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:38,252
if it'll make you happy.

570
00:30:38,287 --> 00:30:39,520
It's not about happy.

571
00:30:39,555 --> 00:30:41,122
Angel.

572
00:30:41,156 --> 00:30:43,257
Angel,
this is our fucking guy.

573
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:51,032
Everyone yearns
for clarity, for closure.

574
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:55,770
But is that ever
really possible?

575
00:30:59,374 --> 00:31:00,941
Jamie?

576
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:03,310
Harrison's outgrown
half his toys.

577
00:31:03,345 --> 00:31:04,979
I know we had to go
through them.

578
00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:06,180
I just didn't know
it was gonna be now.

579
00:31:06,215 --> 00:31:07,282
I'm almost done.

580
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:09,318
I wanted to do it while
he's asleep.

581
00:31:09,352 --> 00:31:10,486
Anything we're unsure about,

582
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,422
we can put in
the keep-for-now pile.

583
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:18,527
What's the other pile?

584
00:31:18,562 --> 00:31:22,365
Trash.

585
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:25,068
You put Lamby in the trash?

586
00:31:25,102 --> 00:31:27,704
Lamby smells like pee.

587
00:31:27,738 --> 00:31:31,441
And Harrison
hasn't slept with Lamby

588
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:33,576
in more than a year.

589
00:31:33,611 --> 00:31:35,746
It used to be he couldn't
go to sleep without it.

590
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,181
Aw, I remember.

591
00:31:37,215 --> 00:31:39,316
Keep?

592
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:41,552
Nah.

593
00:31:41,587 --> 00:31:43,555
Yeah, a lot of kids sleep
with security blankets

594
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:44,923
when they're little,

595
00:31:44,957 --> 00:31:47,092
but once they
start socializing,

596
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:49,561
you know, learning how
to be part of a group,

597
00:31:49,595 --> 00:31:51,262
they don't need it.

598
00:31:51,297 --> 00:31:53,665
And Harrison,
because he's a genius,

599
00:31:53,699 --> 00:31:57,535
hit this milestone early.

600
00:31:57,569 --> 00:31:59,537
He was so small.

601
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:03,141
Lamby was a gift
from Rita's mother

602
00:32:03,176 --> 00:32:04,709
when he was born.

603
00:32:04,744 --> 00:32:07,011
Maybe we should keep it
for Harrison.

604
00:32:07,046 --> 00:32:10,715
For Harrison.
Of course.

605
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:24,395
Some toys are more difficult
than others to part with.

606
00:32:43,081 --> 00:32:47,551
Speltzer's already back at work,
digging graves.

607
00:32:49,421 --> 00:32:52,055
He should start
by digging his own.

608
00:32:57,061 --> 00:32:59,829
Miami Metro impounded Speltzer's
little <i>Pied-a-RV</i>

609
00:32:59,864 --> 00:33:01,164
when he was arrested,

610
00:33:01,198 --> 00:33:03,399
but they had to give it back
once he was set free.

611
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,538
Ray's been juicing--

612
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:11,841
at least
he doesn't mind needles.

613
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,443
I can hide up here,

614
00:33:13,477 --> 00:33:14,844
wait for Speltzer
to come home.

615
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:16,813
I'll use the RV
as my kill room

616
00:33:16,847 --> 00:33:20,216
and transportation
to get rid of Ray's body.

617
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:29,692
And his trophies.

618
00:34:10,936 --> 00:34:12,303
I'm still alive,

619
00:34:12,338 --> 00:34:16,240
but I don't think I'm going
to like the reason why.

620
00:34:20,846 --> 00:34:24,949
Speltzer couldn't have
done all of this in a day.

621
00:34:24,983 --> 00:34:28,252
Is this place his masterpiece?

622
00:34:36,094 --> 00:34:37,461
I don't run.

623
00:34:37,495 --> 00:34:40,898
I make people run.

624
00:34:45,304 --> 00:34:53,311
? ?

625
00:35:01,221 --> 00:35:02,688
However, I do run

626
00:35:02,722 --> 00:35:04,990
if there's a bull
coming after me with an ax.

627
00:36:33,846 --> 00:36:36,514
You should really try taking
a shower once in a while.

628
00:36:46,924 --> 00:36:49,125
Where are you?

629
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:58,904
Speltzer keeps forcing me down
to the next floor.

630
00:36:58,938 --> 00:37:00,438
So if he wants me to go down,

631
00:37:00,473 --> 00:37:04,042
what happens if I go up?

632
00:37:47,853 --> 00:37:50,255
He knows my face now.

633
00:37:50,289 --> 00:37:52,257
If I want a rematch,

634
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:54,058
I'm gonna have
to be smarter.

635
00:37:56,962 --> 00:37:58,263
To take Speltzer down,

636
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:01,065
I have to make sure
I have nothing to lose.

637
00:38:04,603 --> 00:38:07,838
Mmm, yummy.

638
00:38:07,873 --> 00:38:10,107
Whoa, Harrison's
only going to Orlando

639
00:38:10,142 --> 00:38:11,609
for a few weeks, Dexter.

640
00:38:11,643 --> 00:38:13,044
Yeah, I know.

641
00:38:13,078 --> 00:38:15,546
He's gonna be fine.

642
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,081
All he'll want to do
is follow Cody around.

643
00:38:17,116 --> 00:38:18,850
Thanks for driving him up.

644
00:38:18,884 --> 00:38:20,485
I actually might spend
a few days there,

645
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:22,554
see what trouble
I can get into.

646
00:38:22,588 --> 00:38:24,056
Knock yourself out.

647
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:28,026
Thanks.
I'll take these down to the car.

648
00:38:33,331 --> 00:38:36,934
Astor and Cody
are excited to see you.

649
00:38:36,968 --> 00:38:39,269
I want you to be good for
your grandma and grandpa, okay?

650
00:38:39,303 --> 00:38:41,938
I'm not sending
Harrison to Orlando

651
00:38:41,972 --> 00:38:44,073
because Deb asked me to,

652
00:38:44,107 --> 00:38:47,242
but because Speltzer
is a problem I need to solve.

653
00:38:47,276 --> 00:38:50,779
Once I do, Harrison will
come home where he belongs.

654
00:38:50,813 --> 00:38:53,282
You mean more to me than...

655
00:38:53,316 --> 00:38:55,484
Pizza!

656
00:38:55,518 --> 00:38:57,019
That's right.

657
00:38:57,053 --> 00:38:59,054
Pizza.

658
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:01,724
Let's go.

659
00:40:32,185 --> 00:40:34,653
I will avenge your death.

660
00:40:38,592 --> 00:40:41,827
Everything I do...

661
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:44,831
is for you.

662
00:41:03,017 --> 00:41:05,118
Deb, you okay?

663
00:41:05,152 --> 00:41:08,121
Ye
yep.

664
00:41:08,155 --> 00:41:10,123
I want to get back
to the station

665
00:41:10,157 --> 00:41:12,758
and finish up the paperwork
on Mike's shooter.

666
00:41:12,793 --> 00:41:15,294
I'll be there in a minute.

667
00:41:25,605 --> 00:41:27,939
Motherfucker.

668
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,614
You impotent fuck.

669
00:41:36,649 --> 00:41:38,817
You got some mouth on you.

670
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:40,285
The fuck are you doing here?
Haven't you done enough?

671
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,220
Oh, I'm just
getting started.

672
00:41:42,254 --> 00:41:44,455
You fucking motherfucking
cocksucker!

673
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:47,024
- All right, all right.
- You fucking piece of shit!

674
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:48,225
Get your shit together.

675
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,162
You're so easy,
just like the others.

676
00:41:51,196 --> 00:41:53,932
Get the fuck out of here.
Come on.

677
00:41:53,966 --> 00:41:55,566
Fuck you up.

678
00:41:55,601 --> 00:41:58,869
I'll you see around.

679
00:42:10,415 --> 00:42:12,416
Batista called.

680
00:42:14,185 --> 00:42:15,219
I'm sure he did.

681
00:42:15,253 --> 00:42:18,222
Whawhat happened?

682
00:42:19,891 --> 00:42:22,626
I fucking lost my mind.

683
00:42:22,661 --> 00:42:26,664
I saw Speltzer
at Melanie's funeral.

684
00:42:28,267 --> 00:42:30,602
Fuckin' smiling
at the hearse, and--

685
00:42:30,637 --> 00:42:32,905
What'd you do?

686
00:42:32,939 --> 00:42:34,073
I fucking attacked him!

687
00:42:34,107 --> 00:42:36,976
I wanted to fucking
kill him.

688
00:42:38,712 --> 00:42:41,514
Fuck you.

689
00:42:41,548 --> 00:42:42,715
Is that why
you came here?

690
00:42:42,749 --> 00:42:44,317
To prove some fucking point
that everybody

691
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,086
wants someone dead?

692
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,790
I came here
to see how you are.

693
00:42:50,825 --> 00:42:54,060
That's all.

694
00:42:55,996 --> 00:42:58,998
I'm just fucking great.

695
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:15,147
Is this ever
gonna get easier?

696
00:43:15,181 --> 00:43:17,449
Nothing's really
all that different, Deb.

697
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:26,659
The only thing
that's changed

698
00:43:26,694 --> 00:43:29,595
is now
you know more about me.

699
00:43:29,629 --> 00:43:32,632
What I know about you...

700
00:43:36,936 --> 00:43:39,338
makes you a completely
different person.

701
00:43:39,372 --> 00:43:41,206
But I'm not.

702
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:45,510
I'm the same person
I've always been.

703
00:43:45,545 --> 00:43:47,713
Your brother,
the same person

704
00:43:47,747 --> 00:43:49,881
who will always
be there for you.

705
00:43:57,155 --> 00:44:01,158
Maybe the question is whether
you'll be there for me.

706
00:44:10,601 --> 00:44:13,570
I don't know if I can
feel the same way about us.

707
00:44:15,973 --> 00:44:18,341
I do.

708
00:44:21,879 --> 00:44:25,715
I do

709
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,752
And I don't too.

710
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:59,316
Are we sure this
Alex Dubrozny guy

711
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:01,685
shot Mike Anderson?

712
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:03,420
Why the fuck are you
trying to rattle this?

713
00:45:03,454 --> 00:45:05,155
'Cause it smells
like a setup.

714
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,757
And what does a setup
smell like?

715
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:09,026
This bartender had no record
back in Kursk.

716
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:11,329
Suddenly he decides
to murder three people?

717
00:45:11,363 --> 00:45:13,798
Alex had a short fuse,

718
00:45:13,832 --> 00:45:16,034
a broken heart,
a loaded gun.

719
00:45:16,068 --> 00:45:19,437
A gun that Masuka confirmed
was the same one used on Mike.

720
00:45:19,471 --> 00:45:22,006
And we got a sweet
little suicide note

721
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:25,277
that helped us solve not just
Mike's murder, but two others.

722
00:45:25,311 --> 00:45:27,913
That's what
a setup smells like.

723
00:45:27,947 --> 00:45:30,349
It's all too neat,
too easy.

724
00:45:30,383 --> 00:45:32,117
Alex wasn't even
on our radar.

725
00:45:32,151 --> 00:45:33,652
Why would
he off himself now?

726
00:45:33,686 --> 00:45:36,988
His conscious
got to him.

727
00:45:37,022 --> 00:45:38,890
Let's just
swing by the club

728
00:45:38,924 --> 00:45:41,392
one last time,
ask around.

729
00:45:41,427 --> 00:45:43,094
This is Mike
we're talking about here.

730
00:45:44,396 --> 00:45:48,499
Fine
not tonight.

731
00:45:48,534 --> 00:45:50,167
- What's her name?
- Nadia.

732
00:45:50,202 --> 00:45:53,304
- The stripper?
- She's a dancer.

733
00:45:53,338 --> 00:45:55,073
Just doesn't keep
a lot of her clothes on.

734
00:45:55,107 --> 00:45:56,741
You serious about her?

735
00:45:56,775 --> 00:45:58,276
I don't know what
I am about her.

736
00:45:58,311 --> 00:46:01,580
But she was real close
to Kaja and Tony,

737
00:46:01,614 --> 00:46:04,083
and all this
is real hard on her.

738
00:46:04,117 --> 00:46:06,252
Oh, I'm so glad
you're there to comfort her.

739
00:46:06,286 --> 00:46:08,921
- Come on.
- I'm just jealous.

740
00:46:08,955 --> 00:46:10,222
At least you got
someone in your life.

741
00:46:10,256 --> 00:46:12,324
She's got a lot
of pretty friends.

742
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:13,892
I'm a twice-divorced
detective

743
00:46:13,926 --> 00:46:16,060
staring down the barrel
of retirement.

744
00:46:16,095 --> 00:46:17,395
I'm already a cliche.

745
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:19,564
No need to add fucking
a stripper to that list.

746
00:46:19,598 --> 00:46:21,666
All right, fine.
We'll go by the club tomorrow,

747
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,901
make sure Alex isn't
some patsy for the mob.

748
00:46:23,936 --> 00:46:26,938
Have a good night.

749
00:46:42,653 --> 00:46:44,587
Fight or flight.

750
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:50,226
That's a part of everyone's
lizard brain.

751
00:47:08,715 --> 00:47:12,284
Speltzer may have
a lizard brain like me,

752
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:13,552
but his shortcoming
is he doesn't

753
00:47:13,586 --> 00:47:15,654
have much
of a human brain.

754
00:47:36,509 --> 00:47:37,742
What the fuck is this?

755
00:47:37,776 --> 00:47:39,744
The end of your run.

756
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:43,747
Get me out of here!

757
00:47:44,983 --> 00:47:47,685
Yell all you want.
No one's gonna hear ya.

758
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:49,186
Fuck.

759
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,521
Fuck!

760
00:47:50,555 --> 00:47:54,892
Fuck! Fuck!

761
00:47:54,926 --> 00:47:56,527
Feels good.

762
00:47:56,562 --> 00:47:58,697
Fuck!

763
00:48:01,634 --> 00:48:03,201
Normally now is when
I'd slice your cheek

764
00:48:03,236 --> 00:48:04,970
with my scalpel
and get a drop of blood

765
00:48:05,004 --> 00:48:07,873
to remember you by,
but I can't risk

766
00:48:07,907 --> 00:48:10,142
anyone finding a blood slide
ever again.

767
00:48:10,176 --> 00:48:12,811
You're a fuckin' freak.

768
00:48:12,846 --> 00:48:16,182
I do things
different now.

769
00:48:16,216 --> 00:48:18,718
The memory of killing you
will have to be enough.

770
00:48:18,752 --> 00:48:21,454
I'm gonna kill you.

771
00:48:21,489 --> 00:48:25,391
That would be a twist--

772
00:48:25,426 --> 00:48:29,662
and not one that's
gonna happen tonight.

773
00:48:31,498 --> 00:48:33,232
No!

774
00:48:37,104 --> 00:48:38,838
You were supposed
to be a way out of the tangle

775
00:48:38,873 --> 00:48:41,507
I was in with my sister,

776
00:48:41,542 --> 00:48:44,778
a thread she could follow
to understand me better,

777
00:48:44,812 --> 00:48:47,947
to accept me, even.

778
00:48:47,982 --> 00:48:51,451
But she and I lost each other.

779
00:48:51,485 --> 00:48:54,754
She almost lost herself,
going after you.

780
00:48:56,691 --> 00:49:01,061
She wanted to catch you
just as much as I did.

781
00:49:01,095 --> 00:49:02,729
Who knows, maybe
our relationship

782
00:49:02,764 --> 00:49:05,565
can rise
from your ashes.

783
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:09,269
No.

784
00:49:09,303 --> 00:49:10,604
No!

785
00:49:43,706 --> 00:49:46,607
It's time for everyone
to move on.

786
00:50:01,523 --> 00:50:04,526
Good-bye, friends.

787
00:50:50,675 --> 00:50:53,577
You came.

788
00:50:53,611 --> 00:50:55,279
I wasn't sure you would.

789
00:50:55,313 --> 00:50:58,282
Me neither.

790
00:51:01,486 --> 00:51:05,122
What am I doing here?

791
00:51:05,157 --> 00:51:09,159
Uh, that smoke...

792
00:51:18,769 --> 00:51:21,737
it's Speltzer.

793
00:51:31,648 --> 00:51:34,650
Did you do this for me?

794
00:51:40,524 --> 00:51:41,924
No.

795
00:51:50,101 --> 00:51:53,103
How do you feel?

796
00:51:59,577 --> 00:52:02,546
Glad.

797
00:52:13,023 --> 00:52:16,025
What does that make me?

798
00:52:22,865 --> 00:52:24,832
Human.

799
00:52:24,857 --> 00:52:28,857
