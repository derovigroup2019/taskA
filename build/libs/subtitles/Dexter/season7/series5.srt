Who is Dexter Morgan?

7
00:01:46,203 --> 00:01:49,138
He's just a jerk who works
for Miami Metro homicide.

[Silenced gunshot]

00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,675
That's Dexter Morgan.

00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:56,345
His face--
it looks familiar.

11
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,381
Only one person who ever
worked at Miami Metro

12
00:01:58,415 --> 00:01:59,382
ever took blood slides--

13
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:02,620

Are we sure
this Alex Dubrozny guy

17
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:12,665
shot Mike Anderson?

18
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,667

Hannah McKay--

20
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,572
she spent six years in juvie
after pleading guilty

21
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,707
to being Wayne Randall's
accomplice.

22
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:23,410
She always claimed she was just
another one of his victims.

23
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:24,578
Is that
what you're doing here,

24
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:26,113
to help us find the other bodies
Wayne buried?

25
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:28,582
My lawyer said
it was for the best.

26

your rights?

27
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:31,585
Huh?

28
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:34,121

37
00:02:52,374 --> 00:02:54,208
Glad.

38
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:58,379
What does that make me?

39
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:10,325
It never ends, does it?
The maintenance.

40
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:12,127
I don't mind it.

41
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:14,930
It's the one thing
that never changes.

00:03:14,964 --> 00:03:16,799

Harrison's coming home soon.

00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:22,905
I want to have the boat ready.

47
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,074
So life's back to normal?

48
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:28,011
A new normal.

49
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:31,214
Deb's not poring over
the past anymore.

50
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:35,051
We're on course, moving forward.

51
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:37,321
Life can be
less complicated now.

52
00:03:37,355 --> 00:03:38,555
You don't believe that.

53
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,691
Why not?
She didn't abandon me.

54
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:43,361
She didn't accept you either.
She doesn't know what to think.

55
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:46,264
She's adjusting.

56
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:49,034
I did everything in my power
to protect her from you--

57
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:50,536
what you really are.

58
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,637

Your thoughts.

61
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:55,709
You didn't think
she could handle it

62
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:56,810
because you couldn't,

63
00:03:56,844 --> 00:03:58,645
but Deb is stronger
than you are.

64
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:00,380
For now.

65
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:02,649
But the long-term exposure--

66
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:05,117
it's going to eat away at her,

67
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:08,220
like salt water on steel.

68
00:04:18,097 --> 00:04:21,433

It's not from Viktor.

69
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:23,435

71
00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:37,848
This is too much blood.

72
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:39,717

Who are you?

75
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:55,632
All right, look,
if I'm getting shit-canned

76
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,067
and you know something
about it,

77
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:58,868
just give me a heads-up,
all right?

78
00:04:58,903 --> 00:05:01,137
We're bros.

79
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:05,642
First of all,

80
00:05:05,676 --> 00:05:09,546
we are not
and never will be bros.

81
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:12,649
Secondly, I've told you
a million times

82
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:14,919
I don't know anything.
Really?

83
00:05:14,953 --> 00:05:16,887
Then why'd your voice
just rise?

84
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:18,889
Look, I-I took a class
in paralinguistics.

85
00:05:18,923 --> 00:05:21,424
Changing pitch--
dead giveaway for lying.

[Pounds desk]
Get the fuck away from my desk!

87
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:27,430
Am I getting the ax?

88
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:29,065
You are if you don't get
out of my way.

89
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:30,500
Look, I just got off the phone
with a colleague,

90
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:32,269
and LaGuerta's processing
evidence at another lab,

91
00:05:32,303 --> 00:05:33,470
a private lab.

92
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:34,805
What evidence?
What are you talking about?

93
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,840
A charred blood slide of--

94
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:38,841
containing the blood
of one Travis Marshall.

95
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,109
So I asked myself,

96
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:41,944
"Vince, if your lady boss
is processing evidence

97
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:42,945
at another lab--"

98
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,280

Are you certain?

00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:45,648

00:05:49,586 --> 00:05:52,122
I am sure that LaGuerta
is using an outside lab

103
00:05:52,156 --> 00:05:54,858
because she knows
how slammed you are.

104
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:57,293
I'll look into this,
so just fucking relax.

105
00:05:57,328 --> 00:05:58,895
Okay.
Thanks, L.T.

106

Sure.

110
00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:11,273
Masuka got wind
that you're using

111
00:06:11,308 --> 00:06:13,109
an outside lab
to run evidence,

112
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:14,743
and he thinks
he's gonna get fired.

113
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:16,545
Is there anything
I should know?

114
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:18,814
I needed a second pair of eyes
on something.

115
00:06:18,848 --> 00:06:20,816
It's nothing.

116
00:06:22,953 --> 00:06:26,622
Does this have anything to do
with the Bay Harbor butcher?

117
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:32,296
Lundy carried that notebook
everywhere he went.

118
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,632
Get the door.

119
00:06:41,473 --> 00:06:44,342
This has to remain
between you and me.

120
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:46,278
Of course.

121
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:48,947
I had a lab analyze
a blood slide

122
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:50,682
that I found
at the abandoned church.

123
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:54,619
A blood slide, like
a Bay Harbor butcher trophy?

124
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:57,722
Travis Marshall's blood
was on it.

125
00:06:57,757 --> 00:06:59,591
But Doakes was
the Bay Harbor butcher,

126
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,759
and Doakes is dead.

127
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:02,627
Well, what if
it wasn't Doakes?

128
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:05,797
What if the Bay Harbor butcher
is still alive and at work?

129
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:08,967
What if <i>he</i> killed
Travis Marshall?

130
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:12,404
Except Travis Marshall
wasn't cut up into pieces

131
00:07:12,438 --> 00:07:14,272
and put into bags.

132
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:16,541
But the fact
that the Bay Harbor butcher

133
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:19,545
kept blood slides was never
released to the public.

134
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:22,881
It's probably not some copycat.

135
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,784
How do you explain this?

136
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:28,520
I can't.

137
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:32,992
I know it sounds
impossible, but...

138
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:35,761
I never believed
that Doakes was a killer.

139
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:40,665
And from his notes,
Lundy had his doubts too.

140
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,401
Well, you can add me
to that list.

141
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:45,603
Doakes was my partner.

142
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:49,140
He was a good man.

[Sighs]

144
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:55,779
Is there anything
I can do to help?

145
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:59,416
You have no idea how good
it is to hear you say that.

146
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:03,120
I've been keeping
this all to myself.

147
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:09,895

[Beeps]

158
00:08:54,341 --> 00:08:57,610
The blood on my boat
belongs to...

159
00:08:57,645 --> 00:08:59,780
Louis Greene?

160
00:08:59,814 --> 00:09:03,450
Louis is dead?

161
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:05,151
Why was he killed on my boat?

162
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:07,821
Why would he have even been
on my boat?

163
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:10,023
Why...

164
00:09:10,057 --> 00:09:11,792
Is my sister looking at me
like that?

165
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:14,160
Dex...

166
00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:20,267
We are in a storm of fuck.

167
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:22,302
LaGuerta found a blood slide

168
00:09:22,337 --> 00:09:26,173
with Travis Marshall's blood
on it at the fucking church.

169
00:09:28,744 --> 00:09:29,911
That's not good.

170
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,813
How the fuck do you lose
a blood slide?

171
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:35,684
Deb, you know that night
wasn't my usual scenario.

172
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:39,287
Are you saying
that it's my fault

173
00:09:39,322 --> 00:09:40,588
that LaGuerta now thinks

174
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,323
that the Bay Harbor butcher
is alive and well?

175
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:44,158
No, that's not what I meant,

176
00:09:44,193 --> 00:09:48,329
but that night at the church
wasn't exactly

177
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:50,698
by the playbook.

178
00:09:50,732 --> 00:09:52,900
I talked LaGuerta
into letting me help

179
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:54,068
with the investigation,

180
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:56,204
so I can keep tabs
on what's happening.

181
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:57,738
You what?

182
00:09:57,773 --> 00:09:59,507
No.
[Sighs]

183
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,009
I'll deal with this.

184
00:10:01,043 --> 00:10:02,376
I don't want you involved.

185
00:10:02,411 --> 00:10:05,646
Well, it's a little
fucking late for that.

186
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,648
She wants to talk
to the friends and family

187
00:10:07,683 --> 00:10:09,117
of everyone on this list

188
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,452
who's gone missing
since Doakes died.

189
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:13,020
They all the fit
the victim profile

190
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:15,390
of the Bay Harbor butcher.

191
00:10:15,424 --> 00:10:18,025
Anyone here that you recognize?

192
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,029
[Sighs]

193
00:10:22,731 --> 00:10:25,266
These three...

194
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:28,837
are mine.

195
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:31,339
This is never gonna end,
is it?

196
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:32,908
They were bad people, Deb,

197
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:35,677
who would've continued
to do bad things.

198
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:38,346
This is the only one
with family in Miami--

199
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,716
Phillip Barnes.

200
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:43,318
So, when LaGuerta and I
split up the list,

201
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,186
I'll make sure
I get his family.

202
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,888
No, I don't like you
doing this.

203
00:10:46,922 --> 00:10:51,693
I don't give a fuck
what you like, Dexter.

204
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:56,565
It's beyond that.
This is my ass too.

205
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,402
Tell me what I need
to know about Barnes.

206
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:03,805
[Sighs]

207
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,177
He was a wedding photographer.

208
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:11,314
He would find a guest
from out of town--

209
00:11:11,348 --> 00:11:14,917
young, female,
by herself.

210
00:11:14,952 --> 00:11:17,653
He would charm her,
invite her back to his hotel.

211
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:22,858
She'd never come home.

212
00:11:22,893 --> 00:11:26,227
He took pictures
of what he did.

213
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,365
So what'd you do?

214
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,834
He was going out of town
for another job,

215
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:39,438
so I nabbed him
after a reception.

216
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:42,141
A reception?

217
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:44,877
A fucking wedding reception?

218
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:48,080
Dexter, what if Barnes got
a picture of you?

219
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:49,614
- Deb--
- What if someone remembers you?

220
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:51,550
It was a wedding.

221
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:53,885
Everyone was concentrating
on the bride and groom.

222
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,654
I slipped in and out.
It's fine.

223
00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:59,190
What if you're wrong?

224
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:01,092
I'm not.

225
00:12:01,126 --> 00:12:02,926
LaGuerta will not tie me
to this.

226
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:06,163
There's no body, no proof.

227
00:12:06,197 --> 00:12:08,198
Stay away from it, okay?

228
00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:15,839
[Sighs]

229
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:18,507
First thing I have to do
is find out

230
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:22,478
why Louis was killed
on my boat.

231
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:25,247
My curtains are open.

232
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:27,582
With Harrison gone,
Jamie's not around.

233
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:30,017
Someone has been
in my apartment...

234
00:12:30,052 --> 00:12:32,519
Maybe still is.

235
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:41,794
[Telephone rings]

236
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,896
[Answering machine beeps]

237
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,631
Hey, Dex. It's Sam.

238
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,499
Just want to confirm
we're still on

239
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,467
for 1:00
at Schooner or later

240
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,504
at Twelfth and Bayshore Drive.

241
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,806
See you there.
[Cell phone beeps]

242
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:12,456
[Door opens]

243
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,893
I've met him before at the bar
at the Fox Hole--

244
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:18,696
owned by
the Koshka brotherhood.

245
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,064
The man who killed
Mike Anderson,

246
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:22,800
Viktor Baskov,
was one of the Koshkas.

247
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:24,568
Could they have figured out
I killed Viktor

248
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,171
and sent a hit man
after me?

249
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:32,176
[Indistinct chatter]

250
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,292
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

251
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,995
I think I have a phone call
for you.

252
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,531
A small coffee, please.

253
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,033
Hello?

254
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,536
Why were you
in my apartment?

255
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,738
Well, aren't you
Mr. smarty-pants?

256
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,739
[Camera shutter clicks]

257
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,040
Answer the question.

258
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,009
What were you doing
in my place?

259
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,978
I was looking to have
a discussion

260
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,181
about a friend of mine
who's gone missing--Viktor.

261
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,849
I'm sure you remember him.

262
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,718
I have no idea
who you're talking about.

263
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:14,153
I don't care for lies.

264
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,788
I told you,
I don't know who that is.

265
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,490
You're wasting both our time.

266
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:21,426
Louis Greene--
who I found on your boat,

267
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,929
the boat that was used to dump
Viktor in the ocean--

268
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,230
gave me your name.

269
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,133
So you killed Louis.

270
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:33,170
We had a conversation
that ended rather abruptly, yes.

271
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:35,072
What else did Louis say?

272
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:37,507
I believe
he may have referred to you

273
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:39,042
as a douche bag.

274
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:40,843
You think you're very clever.

275
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:42,111
I do, actually, yes.

276
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:44,514
Your bosses
at the Koshka brotherhood--

277
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:46,716
they sent you?
- Ah...

278
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,119
You've done your homework.

279
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:52,388
There are no bosses
telling me what to do.

280
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:54,657
Viktor was a friend of mine.
This is personal.

281
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:56,225
So an eye for an eye, huh?

282
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:58,895
Your friend Viktor kills
an innocent woman and a cop,

283
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:01,998
and killing me
somehow settles the score?

284
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,433
Oh, you misunderstand me.

285
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,835
I'm not stopping with you.

286
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:07,904
I also want any
of your police officer friends

287
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:09,639
involved
in this little vendetta...

288
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:10,640
Wait.

289
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:12,575
Including
your lieutenant sister.

290
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,410
I've done my homework too.

291
00:15:14,444 --> 00:15:18,180
It was just me.
She had nothing to do with this.

292
00:15:19,683 --> 00:15:20,816
Hello, handsome.

293
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:22,918
I work alone.

294
00:15:22,953 --> 00:15:25,321
I killed Viktor--only me.

295
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:26,623
I'll see you around.

296
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,558
That's the plan.

297
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,996
Why in fuck-ville
are you telling me

298
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,531
to meet you
in the parking garage?

299
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,166
Because of him.

300
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,835
Do you want to be
a little more specific?

301
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:39,269
His name is Isaak Sirko.

302
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:42,072
He's part
of the Koshka brotherhood.

303
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:43,706
He's after me.

304
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:46,075
But don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of it.

305
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:47,109
What did you do?

306
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:48,711
But you could be
in danger too.

307
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:50,012
That's why you need to know.

308
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:51,647
That's why we're meeting here
and why--

309
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:53,716
- Dex.
- But I'm gonna handle this.

310
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,284
Why is he after you?

311
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:56,818
[Sighs]

312
00:15:56,853 --> 00:15:59,788
Viktor Baskov.

313
00:15:59,822 --> 00:16:02,791
Viktor Baskov disappeared.

314
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:07,529
You killed him.

315
00:16:07,563 --> 00:16:09,931
He killed Mike Anderson.

316
00:16:09,965 --> 00:16:12,701
What about the guy
that said he killed Mike--

317
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:15,203
the--the bartender that blew
his fucking brains out?

318
00:16:15,237 --> 00:16:17,673
Someone put him up to it--
Isaak probably--

319
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:20,242
so that you would close the case
and move on.

320
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:22,844
This is un-fucking real.

321
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:25,013
Viktor Baskov was on his way
back to Kiev.

322
00:16:25,048 --> 00:16:26,281
I had to kill him.

323
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:27,949
I didn't have any more time.

324
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:29,217
There wasn't--
time? You didn't-

325
00:16:29,252 --> 00:16:30,785
you didn't have time
to make a phone call

326
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,320
so that I could--I don't know--
fucking arrest him

327
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:34,055
or something?
His flight was leaving.

328
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:35,323
His

329
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:39,961
how do you know
he killed Mike?

330
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:42,263
I found his fingerprint
at the scene.

331
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,701
And you didn't tell me?

332
00:16:47,735 --> 00:16:50,437
You kept it
from the police department?

333
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,275
Dex, so what happened to you
only taking care

334
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,044
of people that slip
through the cracks

335
00:16:58,078 --> 00:16:59,445
of the justice system?

336
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:01,614
You can't rip a case wide open

337
00:17:01,648 --> 00:17:04,183
so that it conveniently falls
into your fucking lap!

338
00:17:04,217 --> 00:17:05,417
I know.

339
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:06,952
Obviously
you don't know, Dexter,

340
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:09,854
because this is normal
for you.

341
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:12,289
But trust me, this is not
fucking normal for me,

342
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,557
not at all.

343
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:15,692
How am I supposed to do
my fucking job?

344
00:17:15,727 --> 00:17:18,061
Which at this point is the
be-all, end-all of hypocrisy,

345
00:17:18,096 --> 00:17:20,231
because I am the lieutenant
of fucking homicide,

346
00:17:20,265 --> 00:17:24,168
and I have already helped you
cover up two murders.

347
00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:25,836
Three--
this makes three.

348
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:28,406
And the fucking bartender--
oh, my fucking God.

349
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,109
Oh, my God.

350
00:17:31,143 --> 00:17:35,013
How did this become my life?

351
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:37,315
- Deb, where are you going?
- I'm gonna arrest Isaak!

352
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:38,983
I'm gonna take him
to fucking jail.

353
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:40,685
- On what charge?
- I'll find something!

354
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:42,187
No!
We can't--

355
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:46,558
I can't afford to risk him
talking.

356
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,762
Look, I will handle this,
but until I do,

357
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:53,531
we need to take
extra precautions.

358
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:57,469
Isaak is convinced that
there's some police conspiracy.

359
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:02,140
He thinks we all killed Viktor,
so you're at risk too.

360
00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:03,241
What?

361
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:06,177
But I can keep you safe.

362
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,279
We're gonna go to a hotel...
[Scoffs]

363
00:18:08,313 --> 00:18:10,547
A place where no one knows
who we are,

364
00:18:10,582 --> 00:18:12,649
where no one
asks any questions,

365
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:14,484
a place where
we'll both be safe.

366
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:16,620
This is fucking fantastic.

367
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:20,290
He might be watching
the precinct, your home.

368
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:22,660
I need you to take a car
from the motor pool,

369
00:18:22,694 --> 00:18:24,829
make sure you never leave
the same way twice.

370
00:18:24,863 --> 00:18:28,299
Make sure no one follows you.
I'll do the same.

371
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:31,102
I need you
to promise me something.

372
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:32,237
What?

373
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:35,775
That you will never take
a case

374
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:39,178
from the police department
again, from me, ever.

375
00:18:39,213 --> 00:18:41,581
Okay.

376
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:43,750
Are you lying to me?

377
00:18:43,784 --> 00:18:45,452
I don't think so.

378
00:18:45,486 --> 00:18:47,821
You don't think so?
You don't fucking think so?

379
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:51,225
I'm not lying.

380
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:54,461
I have no way of knowing,
do I?

381
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,042
When you begin a stalk,
you start with what you know.

382
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:12,479
And with Isaak,
that isn't much.

383
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,935
Isaak isn't just some hit man.

384
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:35,502
He's a boss.

[Car departing]

387
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:47,649
Yes?

388
00:19:47,684 --> 00:19:50,953
Dexter, Hannah McKay
is on her way in.

389
00:19:50,987 --> 00:19:53,589
I'm kind of tied up
with something right now.

390
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:55,825
Dexter,
Hannah is gonna talk us

391
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:57,694
through her road trip
with Wayne Randall

392
00:19:57,728 --> 00:19:59,596
and help us find the rest
of the bodies.

393
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,099
This is important.
Get here now.

394
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:06,269
Right.
I'm on my way.

00:20:06,303 --> 00:20:08,071

[Engine turning]

397
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:14,444
In that first week,

398
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:16,379
Wayne shot
a gas station attendant

399
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:18,314
in Ashford, Alabama.

400
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:21,284
That's where these are from.

401
00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:24,320
And Wayne shot
another attendant

402
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:27,256
in Lake City, Florida.

403
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:38,100
And then he shot a guy
outside of Sarasota

404
00:20:38,135 --> 00:20:41,070
who stopped to help you
fix a flat.

405
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:44,474
[Pen clicks]

406
00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:46,209
You then get picked up
in Miami

407
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:49,479
trying to sneak on board
a cruise ship.

408
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:52,550
That week you guys were
in Miami--

409
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,486
that's the story
we don't know...

410
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,987
The people Wayne killed,

411
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,091
the bodies we'd like to find.

412
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,427
It looks like it starts here.

413
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,396
Uh...

414
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,299
Uh, we got to Miami,

415
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,536
and we were the only thing
on the news.

416
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:12,238
We were desperate--
no money,

417
00:21:12,273 --> 00:21:14,441
cops everywhere.

418
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:16,710
Wayne decided that we would
hide out in the motels

419
00:21:16,744 --> 00:21:20,380
until we could make it
to that cruise ship.

420
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:27,986
He killed people
so we could take their rooms.

421
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,656
We buried the bodies
close to the motels.

422
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,057
Where were the motels?

423
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:34,992
One was by a Frosty Swirl--

424
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,261
uh, Wayne's favorite.

425
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:38,996
That's where Miss Dubois
was found.

426
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,031
What about these?

427
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,600
Those two go together.

428
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,068
Together?

429
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,237
They were a couple--

430
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:49,040
husband and wife,
I guess.

431
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:52,544
- Where are they buried?
- Close to one of the ports.

432
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:54,846
I remember
big ships unloading.

433
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,781
And the motel?

434
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,650
Small...

435
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,452
Um, one-story--

436
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:01,687
I think I would recognize it,

437
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:05,358
but so much of that time
is just a blur, you know?

438
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:10,897
Everything changed in Miami--
Wayne, most of all.

439
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:12,799
I was so scared.

440
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:16,737
I thought
that he was gonna kill me.

441
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:18,238
He forced me to help him
dig those holes,

442
00:22:18,273 --> 00:22:20,341
and every time
that I dug one of them,

443
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:24,211
I-I wasn't sure if I was digging
my own grave or not.

444
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:26,347
I understand how difficult
this is for you,

445
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:27,982
but if you'll excuse me,

446
00:22:28,016 --> 00:22:30,818
I'm gonna get the ball rolling
on the next dig--

447
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:33,220
tomorrow if possible.

448
00:22:33,255 --> 00:22:36,657

Can I have
your giraffe back, please?

454
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,255
It's Wayne's...

455
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:11,623
Wayne's giraffe.

456
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:14,859
It was wrapped
in your shirt.

457
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,862
What, are you
a detective now too?

458
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:28,740
Sergeant Batista will give you
the details for tomorrow.

459
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,709
Will you be there?

460
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:35,982
I hope so.

a lot of Koshkas very angry...

another night.

Hopefully we won't have to.

on a solution?

I have a plan, yes.

471
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:19,825
Does it involve you
killing someone?

the trigger.

Hi.

540
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,750
I'm Captain Maria LaGuerta,
Miami Metro,

541
00:28:33,785 --> 00:28:35,152
and this is
Lieutenant Debra Morgan.

542
00:28:35,186 --> 00:28:37,521
I talked to your mom,
Patricia. Is she home?

543
00:28:37,555 --> 00:28:39,489
No, uh, sorry.
She got called into work.

544
00:28:39,523 --> 00:28:41,324
Oh, that--
we'll come back.

545
00:28:41,358 --> 00:28:43,226
Is this about my dad?

546
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:44,828
She said you guys had called.

547
00:28:44,863 --> 00:28:47,631
I could try to answer
any questions, if you want.

548
00:28:47,665 --> 00:28:50,601
That would be very helpful.

549
00:28:50,635 --> 00:28:51,736
Yeah.

550
00:28:59,411 --> 00:29:02,246
When was the last time
you saw your father?

551
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:05,182
May 19, 2007--

552
00:29:05,217 --> 00:29:07,184
the best fucking day
of my life.

553
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:09,353
How so?

554
00:29:09,388 --> 00:29:13,391
'Cause he never came back.

555
00:29:13,425 --> 00:29:15,960
So wasn't it hard growing up
without a father?

556
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:17,328
It was a hell
of a lot better

557
00:29:17,362 --> 00:29:19,697
than growing up with a father
who beat me and my mom

558
00:29:19,732 --> 00:29:21,766
every chance he got.

559
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,535
I'm sorry.

560
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,271
Then one night,
he didn't come home.

561
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,307
I swear,
everything got better.

562
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:30,910
My mom wasn't crying
all the time,

563
00:29:30,944 --> 00:29:34,080
and I wasn't constantly looking
over my shoulder.

564
00:29:34,115 --> 00:29:35,482
Ty, you mentioned
the last time

565
00:29:35,516 --> 00:29:38,585
you saw your father--
he was working a wedding?

566
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,487
Yeah, uh,
my mom printed out

567
00:29:40,522 --> 00:29:41,956
some pictures for you
from that night.

568
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,591
She--she thought
you might want them.

569
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:45,759
Great.

570
00:29:47,262 --> 00:29:50,664
What are you hoping to find
in these pictures?

571
00:29:50,699 --> 00:29:52,566
Special Agent Lundy
had this theory

572
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:55,002
that the Bay Harbor butcher
was in law enforcement.

573
00:29:55,036 --> 00:29:57,571
If Barnes was killed
by the butcher...

574
00:29:57,605 --> 00:29:59,373
then his face might be
in one of the pictures.

575
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:01,676
We might even know him...
or her.

Yeah. No.

578
00:30:13,955 --> 00:30:15,656
Okay.

579
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,229
What are you looking
for exactly?

580
00:30:22,263 --> 00:30:23,397
We think your father

581
00:30:23,431 --> 00:30:26,000
may have been abducted
and murdered

582
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:27,401
the night he disappeared,

583
00:30:27,435 --> 00:30:32,139
and the person responsible
could be in these pictures.

584
00:30:32,174 --> 00:30:35,209
Mom would finally know
he's not coming home.

585
00:30:35,243 --> 00:30:37,612
This is a big wedding--
a lot of pictures.

586
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:41,683
You know, maybe I should take
these back to the station

587
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:44,886
and spend the day
going over them.

588
00:30:47,357 --> 00:30:49,492
You're right.

589
00:30:49,526 --> 00:30:51,661
We shouldn't rush this.

590
00:30:51,695 --> 00:30:54,163
Thank you, Ty.
Thanks.

Our lucky day.

604
00:31:38,075 --> 00:31:41,344
It's a safe assumption
that Wayne started

605
00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:42,679
with the male.

606
00:31:42,713 --> 00:31:45,648
It would've been important
to immobilize him first,

607
00:31:45,682 --> 00:31:49,986
'cause he presented
the biggest threat.

608
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,355
There are defensive wounds
on the arms and the hands.

609
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,456
He put up a fight.

610
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:56,460
Judging from the cuts
in the fabric,

611
00:31:56,494 --> 00:31:59,662
we're looking at perhaps
a six-inch knife.

612
00:31:59,697 --> 00:32:02,932
Numerous shallow wounds

613
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:06,336
until Wayne was able
to inflict this--

614
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,239
the fatal wound.

615
00:32:09,273 --> 00:32:12,509
Once he was done with him,

616
00:32:12,543 --> 00:32:16,546
he moved on
to the female victim.

617
00:32:18,215 --> 00:32:20,383
Stabbed numerous times.

618
00:32:20,418 --> 00:32:22,185
The spatter pattern

619
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:26,222
suggests
the victim fell on her back.

620
00:32:26,257 --> 00:32:28,992
And these voids here
likely indicate

621
00:32:29,026 --> 00:32:32,695
that she was straddled
by her assailant...

than Wayne.

to the lab and run some tests.

right at me.

for talking back to Wayne.

and slashed at me.

that I don't?

Wayne didn't kill
that woman.

648
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:07,087
He was too busy with the male.
It was someone smaller--

with a different knife

and over

until the knife got so bloody,

716
00:39:24,102 --> 00:39:26,137
He's a member
of the Rojas cartel.

717
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:28,406
We ran into each other
a few times

718
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,607
when I worked narcotics.

719
00:39:29,641 --> 00:39:32,043
Is it possible
Isaak did all of this?

720
00:39:32,077 --> 00:39:34,545
Why do drug hits
have to be so messy?

721
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,915
You got to make
a big show.

722
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:40,785
Who do think good's
for this--the Eighty-Sevens?

723
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,788
Or the Koshka brotherhood.

724
00:39:42,822 --> 00:39:45,457
Koshkas?

725
00:39:48,361 --> 00:39:49,928
What happened here, Dex?

726
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:55,335
Considering this one
was closest to the door,

727
00:39:55,369 --> 00:39:57,770
he was probably
first to see the attacker,

728
00:39:57,805 --> 00:39:59,939
first to respond.

729
00:39:59,974 --> 00:40:03,943
He drew his gun
as the attacker fired.

730
00:40:06,981 --> 00:40:08,949
The misting
on the juke box and the wall

731
00:40:08,983 --> 00:40:10,817
indicates
multiple bullet hits,

732
00:40:10,851 --> 00:40:13,220
all through-and-through.

733
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:18,024
Victim number two--

734
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:19,492
Looks like he got
a shot off.

[Gunshot]

736
00:40:23,164 --> 00:40:26,300
But that didn't stop
the assault.

737
00:40:26,334 --> 00:40:28,469
The attacker returned fire...

738
00:40:37,378 --> 00:40:42,016
Twice in the chest,
once in the stomach.

739
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,718
Judging from the lack of pooling
around the body,

740
00:40:43,752 --> 00:40:45,486
suggests that the victim
was dead

741
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:47,155
before the third shot.

742
00:40:47,189 --> 00:40:48,289
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

743
00:40:48,324 --> 00:40:51,459
How many people were here
shooting?

744
00:40:51,494 --> 00:40:54,963
There's only evidence
of one killer--

745
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:57,232
one brutally efficient killer.

746
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:59,401
Jesus fuck.

747
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:06,608
Looks like our attacker ran
out of bullets

748
00:41:06,643 --> 00:41:07,910
right around here.

[Gun clicks]

750
00:41:16,754 --> 00:41:18,989
It's from
a defensive wound.

751
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:21,391
Looks like
it was a deep cut--

752
00:41:21,426 --> 00:41:23,593
forearm maybe,

753
00:41:23,627 --> 00:41:27,764
obviously not fatal.

754
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:30,200
The attacker grabbed
the nearest weapon...

755
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:32,235
[Glass shatters]
hit his victim over the head,

756
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:35,305

a massive skull fracture...

So we're looking
for the fucking Terminator.

Let's get the blood running
through the system

761
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:53,889
as quickly as possible.

762
00:41:53,923 --> 00:41:55,724

to a name.

00:41:56,826 --> 00:41:58,060
Okay, everybody outside.

their thing.

Was this part
of your fantastic plan?

770

I never said
my plan was fantastic,

771
00:42:13,912 --> 00:42:17,281
but, no, this is not
how I thought it would go.

772
00:42:17,316 --> 00:42:19,417
Do we have an even bigger
problem on our hands now?

773
00:42:19,451 --> 00:42:22,887
Not if we can find
a match for this blood.

774
00:42:22,921 --> 00:42:24,689
You'll be able to make
an arrest.

You're gonna have
to start using it.

Alex has been in this country
for two years,

00:46:25,932 --> 00:46:28,833
and according to every stripper
I interviewed,

827

all he talked about
was his wife and his kids.

828

He didn't show any interest
towards Kaja.

that I've learned as lieutenant

You killed Viktor.
I liked Viktor.

When he returned to Kiev
afterwards,

some fat, little party official

881

resented the fact
that everyone admired him,

882

so he decided to make
an example of him

885

he was hung in front
of the council chambers.

a teenager.

When that party official
saw the hatred in his eyes,

888
00:50:15,499 --> 00:50:18,801
he had him arrested
and sent to Siberia.

889

And the years rolled by.

00:50:37,086 --> 00:50:38,686
he returned to Kiev

894
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:42,590
and celebrated
in front of city hall

895
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:44,158
with all the others.

896
00:50:44,192 --> 00:50:46,360
And that's when he found

897
00:50:46,394 --> 00:50:50,164
that fat,
little party official.

898
00:50:50,198 --> 00:50:53,334
And he got to enjoy the pleasure
that belonged to him

899
00:50:53,368 --> 00:50:55,336
and him alone

900
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:58,439
by sticking a six-inch knife

901
00:50:58,473 --> 00:51:01,842
into that fat,
little man's kidney.

902
00:51:03,545 --> 00:51:06,114
So you ask me...

903
00:51:06,148 --> 00:51:09,451
if this is over.

904
00:51:09,485 --> 00:51:11,220
No.

905
00:51:11,254 --> 00:51:13,655
I'm afraid not.

906
00:51:17,094 --> 00:51:18,494
There's only one problem.

907
00:51:18,528 --> 00:51:19,495
And that is?

908
00:51:19,529 --> 00:51:21,764
I'm not some fat, little man.

909
00:51:21,799 --> 00:51:24,033
[Laughs]

910
00:51:24,068 --> 00:51:27,137
That's true.

911
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:29,039
I don't know who you are.

912
00:51:31,576 --> 00:51:34,245
If you ever find out,
you'll regret it.

913
00:51:36,181 --> 00:51:37,682
[Hangs up phone]

914
00:51:38,918 --> 00:51:41,620
[Hangs up phone]

915
00:51:41,654 --> 00:51:43,955
[Knock at door]

916
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:46,157
Hey.
Come on in.

917
00:51:46,192 --> 00:51:49,160
See this?

918
00:51:49,195 --> 00:51:50,628
What is it?

919
00:51:50,662 --> 00:51:55,533
It's me life-guarding your ass
for a change.

920
00:51:55,567 --> 00:51:58,168
I took it from LaGuerta.

921
00:52:01,406 --> 00:52:02,873
I told you to stay clear
of this.

922
00:52:02,908 --> 00:52:06,678
Well, you're lucky I didn't.

923
00:52:06,712 --> 00:52:09,548
- Deb--
- She would've seen you, Dexter.

924
00:52:09,582 --> 00:52:12,718
[Chuckles]

925
00:52:15,021 --> 00:52:17,390
So you saved me.

926
00:52:17,424 --> 00:52:19,893
Yeah.

927
00:52:24,264 --> 00:52:26,633
Thanks.

928
00:52:28,936 --> 00:52:32,271
It's yours.
It's not mine.

929
00:52:32,305 --> 00:52:35,240
I don't want to be involved
in that part of your life.

930
00:52:35,275 --> 00:52:38,143
I don't want you to be.

931
00:52:38,178 --> 00:52:39,845
I know you're not gonna stop.

932
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,447
[Sighs]

933
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:45,417
But I don't want to know
about it.

934
00:52:45,451 --> 00:52:47,719
Okay.

935
00:52:49,321 --> 00:52:52,423
I had to lie to Batista...

936
00:52:52,457 --> 00:52:56,927
[Voice breaking]
Batista for you.

937
00:52:56,961 --> 00:52:58,962
And that was the moment
that I realized

938
00:52:58,996 --> 00:53:01,431
that I don't want to be
a part of this.

939
00:53:01,465 --> 00:53:03,366
I can't do it.

940
00:53:06,036 --> 00:53:07,870
It took me forever
to wrap my brain

941
00:53:07,904 --> 00:53:10,339
around the idea that...

942
00:53:10,374 --> 00:53:12,909
You're not
who I thought you were.

943
00:53:15,212 --> 00:53:17,546
But it doesn't mean
I have to change.

944
00:53:21,217 --> 00:53:23,252
All of your stealing
and your lying

945
00:53:23,286 --> 00:53:26,355
and your covering up...

946
00:53:26,389 --> 00:53:29,559
That's not me.

947
00:53:38,002 --> 00:53:41,038
So you think LaGuerta's
investigation is...

948
00:53:41,072 --> 00:53:43,307
closed?

949
00:53:43,341 --> 00:53:45,909
[Sighs]

950
00:53:48,279 --> 00:53:50,514
No.

951
00:53:50,548 --> 00:53:54,317
Lundy couldn't figure me out.

952
00:53:54,352 --> 00:53:58,021
No reason to think
LaGuerta will.

953
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:05,161
[Bottles clinking]

954
00:54:05,196 --> 00:54:07,730
Oh, if Lundy
could see me now...

955
00:54:07,764 --> 00:54:11,533
[Chuckles]

956
00:54:11,568 --> 00:54:13,669
And you.

957
00:54:22,846 --> 00:54:24,747
I've been thinking
about our vacation

958
00:54:24,781 --> 00:54:27,517
to Myrtle Beach a lot...

959
00:54:27,551 --> 00:54:29,886
How we spent our days.

960
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,056
On the beach.

961
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:36,359
Running up and down
the shore...

962
00:54:36,394 --> 00:54:38,395
And at low tide,
running in and out of the water.

963
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:42,800
I was always chasing you.
I could never catch you.

964
00:54:42,835 --> 00:54:45,637
You wouldn't take off
your flippers.

965
00:54:45,671 --> 00:54:47,872
[Chuckles]

966
00:54:50,409 --> 00:54:53,044
Even if I did,
you were always...

967
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:54,479
[Clicks tongue]

968
00:54:54,513 --> 00:54:57,148
just out of reach.

969
00:54:58,984 --> 00:55:02,853
Maybe we're learning
it's better that way.

970
00:55:08,694 --> 00:55:10,995
Did you get
the blood report back

971
00:55:11,029 --> 00:55:13,631
on the bodies from the dig?

972
00:55:13,665 --> 00:55:17,101
Yeah.

973
00:55:17,135 --> 00:55:19,904
And?

974
00:55:19,938 --> 00:55:22,339
Anything I should know?

975
00:55:25,376 --> 00:55:28,344
Nope.

976
00:55:36,686 --> 00:55:39,053
[Sighs]

977
00:55:41,123 --> 00:55:43,424
[Drawer opens]

978
00:55:53,769 --> 00:55:58,106
As kids, Deb and I would try
to outrun the waves,

979
00:55:58,141 --> 00:56:00,943
but I would always end up
diving under them.

980
00:56:00,977 --> 00:56:02,644
I'd swim deep

981
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:06,815
because I could withstand
the pull of the tide.

982
00:56:14,391 --> 00:56:18,894
But Deb was always safest
at shore.

983
00:56:18,929 --> 00:56:22,998
From here on out, I'll face
the depths by myself.
