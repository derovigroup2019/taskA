00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:48,203
Previously
on <i>Dexter...</i>

6
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:52,147
Our primary suspect
is Sergeant James Doakes.

7
00:01:52,182 --> 00:01:53,582
Doakes?

8
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:56,151
He is not your man.

9
00:01:56,186 --> 00:01:59,388
I think the Bay Harbor Butcher
is alive

10
00:01:59,422 --> 00:02:00,756
and still in Miami.

11
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,759
Doakes was the Bay Harbor
Butcher, end of story.

12
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:06,795
I found a blood slide
at a crime scene

13
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,064
exactly like the ones
we found in Doakes' car,

14
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:10,632
and Doakes
never had a boat.

15
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:15,070
Here is a list of Miami Metro
personnel who still do.

16
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:17,439
Its point of origin--

17
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:20,108
front center mass
burned upward, downward.

18
00:02:20,143 --> 00:02:21,977
Can we close
the doors?

19
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:23,712
This void,
it's the same thing

20
00:02:23,746 --> 00:02:25,314
that happened
with the first car victim.

21
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:26,682
"Bobby"?

22
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:29,685
Maybe the victim was
letting us know who did this.

23
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,086
You fucked my girl?

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,155
You know, you could learn
a thing or two from her.

25
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:35,591
She takes her job
very seriously.

26
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:41,029
Have you always been
this afraid of the water?

27
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:43,565
Ever since
my father thought

28
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,033
that the best way
to teach me how to swim

29
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:46,568
was to march me down
to the local pond

30
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:47,836
and throw me in.

31
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:48,871
That's horrible.

32
00:02:48,905 --> 00:02:51,306
Six years old,
and I already knew

33
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:53,008
what it felt like
to be dying.

34
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:55,077
Look, I think you have
the wrong idea.

35
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:57,212
Shut up.
I know who you are.

36
00:02:57,247 --> 00:03:00,015
I know <i>what</i> you are.

37
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:01,884
Dexter, you don't have
to save her.

38
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:03,752
You shouldn't even be
with her.

39
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:06,054
It's not even like you
will have a fucking future.

40
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:08,991
All I know is that,
when I'm with you, I feel...

41
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:10,959
Safe.

42
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:22,704
I saw him, and he was coming
through the flames.

43
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,740
He was wearing
a silver-colored suit.

44
00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:26,208
That's
our phantom arsonist.

45
00:03:26,242 --> 00:03:28,810
- He looked like an alien.
- Or a monster.

46
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:31,113
I swear,
he was 7 feet tall.

47
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:34,816
Monsters,
aliens, phantoms--

48
00:03:34,851 --> 00:03:36,552
none of them
are real.

49
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:37,953
The thought
that an actual person

50
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:39,755
could do this
is too awful,

51
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:44,359
so our imaginations create a way
to make it easier to take.

52
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:46,094
But even the strongest
of imaginations

53
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:48,697
can't protect us
once we know the truth.

54
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:49,998
I called you
last night.

55
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:51,533
I wanted to go
over the facts of the case.

56
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:52,668
We can go
over them now.

57
00:03:52,702 --> 00:03:55,170
Where were you?

58
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:58,707
Oh.
You were with Hannah.

59
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:01,443
Find anything?
DNA? Prints?

60
00:04:01,477 --> 00:04:03,178
Nope, nada, zip.

61
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:05,681
Same accelerant as the other
four fires, though--

62
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:07,015
kerosene.

63
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,584
And he left another "Bobby"
scribbled in the soot.

64
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:11,186
Fuck, that's five "Bobby"s
in two weeks.

65
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,055
I mean, he's gotta be signing
his name, right?

66
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:14,723
I mean, it's the only thing
that makes sense.

67
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:16,758
None of the victims
were named Bobby,

68
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:18,927
but, I mean,
fuckload of good that does us.

69
00:04:18,962 --> 00:04:22,097
There are thousands of Bobs
and Roberts in Miami.

70
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:24,266
What do we know
about the latest victim?

71
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,401
Mom took her daughter
to the bathroom.

72
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:27,769
They both
went up in smoke.

73
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:29,438
Kid was six years old.

74
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:31,006
What kind
of sick fuck

75
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,675
does that
to a six-year-old kid?

76
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,714
Maybe the kind
who isn't bothered

77
00:04:38,748 --> 00:04:41,416
by the sight
of a dead child.

78
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:50,659
Hey.
Hey.

79
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:52,494
How you feeling?
You get your stitches out?

80
00:04:52,528 --> 00:04:57,499
Yeah, I'm going to have
a really sexy scar.

81
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:58,800
How was your day?

82
00:04:58,835 --> 00:04:59,901
It was fine.

83
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:02,104
You don't sound fine.

84
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:06,942
The phantom
started another fire today.

85
00:05:06,976 --> 00:05:09,745
It killed
a mother and child.

86
00:05:12,815 --> 00:05:14,116
What?

87
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,183
Why do I get
the feeling

88
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:18,520
you want to wrap him up
in plastic?

89
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:19,988
Doesn't matter.

90
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:23,091
I promised Deb I wouldn't take
any cases from the police.

91
00:05:23,126 --> 00:05:24,226
Well, if you
always listened to Deb,

92
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,627
you wouldn't be here
with me.

93
00:05:25,662 --> 00:05:27,496
I can't kill him,
okay?

94
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,498
Okay, ne.

95
00:05:29,532 --> 00:05:31,900
Sorry.

96
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:35,270
I'm just frustrated.

97
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:38,473
As much as I want
to be here with you,

98
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:41,410
my dark passenger really
wants to be somewhere else.

99
00:05:41,444 --> 00:05:43,779
I'm sorry.
Your dark what?

100
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:46,815
My dark passenger.

101
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:48,617
That's what I call
my need to kill.

102
00:05:48,651 --> 00:05:49,985
Why?

103
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:51,820
Because it's like
this thing living inside me,

104
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:55,190
telling me what to do,
saying I have to kill,

105
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:56,591
not leaving me
any choice.

106
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:58,827
You're not a puppet.
Of course you have a choice.

107
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:00,996
Actually, I don't.

108
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,597
Come on, Dex.

109
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:04,332
It's just you.

110
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:06,301
You're the one
who wants the arsonist dead.

111
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,969
And I don't blame you.
Who wouldn't?

112
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:10,038
- It's not the same.
- Well, what do you mean?

113
00:06:10,073 --> 00:06:11,640
Ignore that.

114
00:06:11,674 --> 00:06:13,175
I-I want
to understand this.

115
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:14,843
How is it different?

116
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:16,678
'Cause a lot of people feel
like they want to kill somebody,

117
00:06:16,713 --> 00:06:18,113
but I have
to follow through.

118
00:06:18,147 --> 00:06:20,015
I follow through,
and I don't have

119
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:22,551
a...
dark passenger.

120
00:06:22,585 --> 00:06:24,653
You don't get it.

121
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:27,856
I'm trying to.

122
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,891
But, no,
I don't get it.

123
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:33,829
There's a man
in the window.

124
00:06:33,863 --> 00:06:35,197
What?

125
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:36,865
- Hi, Banana!
- Oh, my God.

126
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:40,802
That's my dad.

127
00:06:40,837 --> 00:06:42,971
I'm sorry
if I surprised you.

128
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:44,740
I didn't even know
Hannah had a boyfriend.

129
00:06:44,774 --> 00:06:45,741
I don't know
why you would.

130
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:47,008
I haven't spoken
to you since--

131
00:06:47,043 --> 00:06:48,009
Go ahead
and say it.

132
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:50,979
Since before I went
to prison.

133
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:53,715
Clint McKay, convicted felon.
Nice to meet you.

134
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,383
No need
to get nervous.

135
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:57,619
I was just in
for check kiting,

136
00:06:57,653 --> 00:06:59,821
and I got out early
on good behavior.

137
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:01,823
Dad,
what are you doing here?

138
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:03,825
Well, let me just
get to the point.

139
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,595
I don't know what Hannah's
told you about me.

140
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:07,696
Uh, not a lot.

141
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,198
Just that you almost
let her drown.

142
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:12,567
Well,
the truth is,

143
00:07:12,602 --> 00:07:17,706
I was real, genuine asshole
of a father.

144
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,476
And I needed to admit that
to you in person.

145
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:24,012
Dad, can we please not
do this in front of Dexter?

146
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:25,313
No,
if you two are together,

147
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:26,982
then I-I want him
to hear this.

148
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:28,850
I spent a lot of time
with a prison shrink,

149
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:30,552
working through
my issues.

150
00:07:30,586 --> 00:07:32,888
He said it's important
to take responsibility,

151
00:07:32,922 --> 00:07:35,524
so that's
what I'm here to do.

152
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:36,892
Okay.

153
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:40,796
Now, I don't expect you
to forgive me.

154
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,364
I don't see any reason
that you should,

155
00:07:42,398 --> 00:07:45,300
not after everything
I put you through.

156
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,569
But it's important
you know,

157
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:49,504
no matter what,

158
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:53,308
I always loved you.

159
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:57,846
I always will.

160
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:04,085
I've got something for you
in my truck.

161
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,856
Let me give it to you,
and I'll be on my way.

162
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:13,261
Surprise.

163
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:14,729
It's your dollhouse,

164
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:16,231
repainted and rebuilt.

165
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:18,733
It was
in your Aunt Cindy's garage.

166
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:20,035
I figured you loved it
so much as a kid,

167
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:23,104
you might like
to have it now.

168
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:27,909
Uh, Dex,
give me a hand?

169
00:08:36,118 --> 00:08:37,452
Well,

170
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:40,288
I guess I'll be on my way,
let you two

171
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:41,356
get back
to your dinner.

172
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,426
There's a diner
at the Purple Flamingo,

173
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,927
where I'm staying.

174
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:48,096
They say they make
a pretty decent burger.

175
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,066
Okay.

176
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,401
Okay.

177
00:08:53,436 --> 00:08:56,571
I guess
I'll see you around then.

178
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,909
Nice to meet you,
Dexter.

179
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:07,349
You look good, Banana,
happy.

180
00:09:07,383 --> 00:09:10,418
Glad to see
you're doing okay.

181
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:19,461
I'm sure
he meant well,

182
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:23,064
but he could not have given me
a worse gift.

183
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:26,101
Brings up
so much shit.

184
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:27,936
What kind of shit?

185
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,438
When I was eight, he took me
to a poker tournament,

186
00:09:30,473 --> 00:09:34,242
lied to my mom and said that
we were going to a county fair,

187
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:38,313
and stashed me
in a motel room.

188
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:41,449
Went to play cards and didn't
come back for three days.

189
00:09:44,353 --> 00:09:46,321
That's awful.

190
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:49,658
When he came back,
he brought the dollhouse,

191
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,192
bragging about a big win,

192
00:09:51,227 --> 00:09:52,527
saying that
he'd never leave me again,

193
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:55,297
and making promises
that things would get better.

194
00:09:55,331 --> 00:09:57,165
- And did they?
- No.

195
00:09:57,199 --> 00:09:59,334
Of course not.

196
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:04,272
I don't know.
I'm--

197
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:07,208
he's trying, right?
Maybe--

198
00:10:07,243 --> 00:10:11,813
maybe this last stint
in lockup did him some good.

199
00:10:11,847 --> 00:10:14,282
Yeah, maybe.

200
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:21,122
Most likely,
we're looking

201
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:22,791
for a male suspect.

202
00:10:22,825 --> 00:10:25,627
Egocentric,
manipulative,

203
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:29,698
possibly in or on the outskirts
of law enforcement.

204
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:31,633
He's methodical.

205
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:35,136
Fastidious in his appearance,
poor social skills--

206
00:10:35,171 --> 00:10:39,140
this list is
by no means comprehensive.

207
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:40,475
But it should give you
a pretty good idea

208
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:41,810
of what we're looking at.

209
00:10:41,844 --> 00:10:43,545
Bosso's profile
of the phantom--

210
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,880
he may as well be
describing himself.

211
00:10:45,915 --> 00:10:48,650
An arsonist who works
for the fire department.

212
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:49,951
It's almost too easy.

213
00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:51,419
What else?

214
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:56,524
Hands-on learner,
prone to self-aggrandizement.

215
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,028
Thank you,
investigator Bosso.

216
00:11:00,062 --> 00:11:01,696
Where are we on tracking
the fireproof suit?

217
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:05,367
Oh, there's at least 100 sites
that sell that on the Internet.

218
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:07,369
Almost impossible
to trace.

219
00:11:07,403 --> 00:11:09,237
Are you guys
still interviewing witnesses?

220
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:11,006
Yeah, but nobody's seen
the guy's face.

221
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,374
We got more people
coming in today though.

222
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:13,475
Let me know
what you find out.

223
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:15,577
Simms, Miller, any leads
from the tip line?

224
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:16,945
None so far.

225
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:19,581
Mostly girlfriends trying
to get back at their exes.

226
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:20,715
All right.
Keep at it.

227
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,384
Maybe something
will come through.

228
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:23,685
In the meantime,
this fuck has killed

229
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:25,053
seven people
in two weeks.

230
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:28,189
Let's stop him before he
makes it to number eight.

231
00:11:32,128 --> 00:11:33,128
Hannah's wrong.

232
00:11:33,162 --> 00:11:35,163
Of course I have
a dark passenger.

233
00:11:35,197 --> 00:11:39,334
There's no other way
to explain this compulsion.

234
00:11:48,677 --> 00:11:50,712
I hope she knows
what she's doing.

235
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:52,747
Who's sending you
hugs and kisses?

236
00:11:52,782 --> 00:11:56,017
No one.

237
00:11:58,387 --> 00:11:59,954
Bullshit.
That was a girl.

238
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:02,524
Was she sexting you?
You got pictures?

239
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:05,126
Come on,
I gotta restock my spank bank.

240
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:07,595
Hey, Angel, do you know anything
about Dexter's new girlfriend?

241
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,364
- Who, Hannah McKay?
- How did you--

242
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:10,365
Jamie told me.

243
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,234
Ahh, my man.

244
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:16,805
Hannah McKay!

245
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:18,173
Yeah,
that is so awesome.

246
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:20,308
Excuse me, but what
is so fucking awesome

247
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:21,476
about my brother
dating a killer?

248
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,578
You guys heard
Sal Price's recording.

249
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:24,946
Hannah confessed
to murder.

250
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,382
Oh, come on, she was only 15
when she did that.

251
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,483
I mean, when I was 15,
my parents still thought

252
00:12:28,517 --> 00:12:30,085
I was retarded.

253
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,953
Hey, hey.

254
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:33,354
I get it.

255
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:36,891
Hannah is
an attractive girl.

256
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,795
But you should
probably be careful.

257
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,865
Yeah, you--you should
definitely be careful

258
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,068
of getting burned
because she's so freaking hot.

259
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:49,237
Can I see you
in my office, please?

260
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:52,941
I didn't realize

261
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:54,943
you and Hannah McKay
had gone public.

262
00:12:54,977 --> 00:12:56,611
We hadn't,
until a minute ago.

263
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:57,712
Well,
that's kind of dangerous.

264
00:12:57,746 --> 00:12:59,380
Don't you think?

265
00:12:59,415 --> 00:13:01,783
Dating someone so notorious
out in the open like that,

266
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:03,284
when you're trying to stay
under the radar.

267
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:05,553
Deb, I really don't want
to talk about Hannah right now.

268
00:13:05,588 --> 00:13:07,188
Can you just leave it?

269
00:13:07,223 --> 00:13:11,359
Fine, yeah.
I'll butt out.

270
00:13:11,393 --> 00:13:13,628
I mean, we're all
responsible adults, right?

271
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:15,830
You live your life,
I'll live mine,

272
00:13:15,865 --> 00:13:18,066
and Hannah
will live Hannah's.

273
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,101
Great.
And you'll leave Hannah alone?

274
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:23,838
I'm saying that I'll stay
out of your relationship.

275
00:13:23,873 --> 00:13:25,573
I'm not going to let that woman
get away with murder again.

276
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:26,875
That's not
what I meant.

277
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:29,477
Dexter,
I am fucking serious.

278
00:13:29,512 --> 00:13:32,547
I have compromised
the shit out of myself for you.

279
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:35,650
I am sure as fuck not going
to do it for Hannah McKay.

280
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:38,653
Fine.
I get it.

281
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,988
Why are you
standing here?

282
00:13:40,022 --> 00:13:42,991
We have a phantom
to catch.

283
00:13:57,006 --> 00:13:58,540
She did say "we."

284
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:01,309
Philip Bosso.

285
00:14:01,343 --> 00:14:02,944
In his last
27 arson investigations,

286
00:14:02,978 --> 00:14:06,014
he found
the fire's origin point.

287
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:07,448
Either he's great
at his job,

288
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:10,351
or all he had to do
was look in the mirror.

289
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:24,666
Okay,
it says here

290
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,268
that you work as a janitor
at the Y in Brickell Bay

291
00:14:27,303 --> 00:14:29,537
where the, uh, phantom
set the first fire.

292
00:14:29,572 --> 00:14:31,773
Mmhmm.

293
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:33,474
Did you see
anything suspicious

294
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:35,944
when you were making
your rounds that night?

295
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:38,046
No, I didn't even
know it happened

296
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,480
until I saw
the fire truck.

297
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:42,550
It was horrible.

298
00:14:42,585 --> 00:14:44,152
Right.
Right, right, right.

299
00:14:44,186 --> 00:14:48,089
And did you see anyone
in a fireproof suit?

300
00:14:48,123 --> 00:14:50,592
Don't you think
I would've told you if I had?

301
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:56,898
Bosso's S.U.V.

302
00:14:56,932 --> 00:14:58,866
But where did he go?

303
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:02,403
Is he
about to strike again?

304
00:15:13,148 --> 00:15:16,618
Electric fuses
and camping fuel.

305
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:18,553
What are you doing here?

306
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:20,622
That's not
a fireproof suit.

307
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:24,125
Dexter, you
a Civil War reenactor too?

308
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,627
You here for the battle?

309
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:28,463
Uh

310
00:15:28,497 --> 00:15:29,631
yeah.

311
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:31,165
Which side
you fighting for?

312
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,067
The North.

313
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:35,603
You Blue Belly.

314
00:15:35,638 --> 00:15:37,605
I should buck and gag you
right here.

315
00:15:40,976 --> 00:15:42,477
Were you there
last weekend

316
00:15:42,511 --> 00:15:44,912
at the Sixth Maine Battery
cannon firings?

317
00:15:44,947 --> 00:15:47,749
No, damn.
I guess I missed that one.

318
00:15:47,783 --> 00:15:49,183
It's
a whole weekend affair.

319
00:15:49,218 --> 00:15:51,185
I was in charge
of special effects--

320
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,022
ground, air bursts,
artillery fire.

321
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:56,391
Which explains
what's in his car

322
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:59,794
and gives him an alibi
for Saturday's fire.

323
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:03,064
- Want to see some pictures?
- You bet.

324
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:07,568
Wow.

325
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:11,439
Bosso's not the phantom.
He's just strange.

326
00:16:11,473 --> 00:16:13,908
But if he didn't set
those fires, then who did?

327
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:15,143
Oh.

328
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:17,879
Hang on just one sec.

329
00:16:28,624 --> 00:16:31,426
I guess coffee
went better than expected.

330
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:37,932
After coffee, Hannah wanted
to show me the Flower Mart.

331
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:39,967
So we're walking around,

332
00:16:40,002 --> 00:16:42,236
and I catch a whiff
of this flower.

333
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:44,138
It smells
just like licorice.

334
00:16:44,173 --> 00:16:45,973
So I ask Hannah
what it is--

335
00:16:46,008 --> 00:16:47,508
And I tell him
it's anise.

336
00:16:47,543 --> 00:16:49,577
So I tell the lady
in the booth

337
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:51,779
that her anise
smells delicious.

338
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:54,615
Except you didn't quite
pronounce it right.

339
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,150
I don't know exactly
what I said,

340
00:16:56,185 --> 00:16:57,485
but she did not
react well.

341
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,087
Well, do you blame her?

342
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:01,823
Sounds like you had
quite a day.

343
00:17:01,857 --> 00:17:05,526
Yeah, uh--
we, uh, we really did.

344
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:07,628
So, Clint, how long
are you going to be in town?

345
00:17:07,663 --> 00:17:08,930
Oh, just another day
or so.

346
00:17:08,964 --> 00:17:10,865
And then I'm off
to Louisiana.

347
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:12,533
Oh, uh,
what's in Louisiana?

348
00:17:12,568 --> 00:17:14,335
A poker tournament?

349
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,104
No.
I am all done with that.

350
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:19,173
I am looking for an honest way
to make a living.

351
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,309
And I think I found
the perfect thing.

352
00:17:21,343 --> 00:17:23,044
You ready?

353
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:24,846
Crawfish.
Crawfish?

354
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,913
Yeah, a crawfish farm.

355
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:27,749
I got a line on one
near Lafayette.

356
00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:31,018
I'm going to call it
"Big Clint's Crawdaddies,"

357
00:17:31,053 --> 00:17:32,053
and I will ship 'em
to you fresh

358
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:33,087
anywhere in the country.

359
00:17:33,122 --> 00:17:34,522
There's a market
for that?

360
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:35,723
You bet your balls
there is.

361
00:17:35,758 --> 00:17:38,059
Ain't nothing like
a crawfish boil--

362
00:17:38,093 --> 00:17:41,963
weddings, bachelor parties,
fourth of July.

363
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:44,499
Everybody
likes crawdads.

364
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:46,634
Well, I am excited
for you, Dad.

365
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:48,302
And I'm proud of you.

366
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:52,707
Well, thank you, honey.
Means a lot.

367
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:53,741
Well,
I'll tell you what.

368
00:17:53,776 --> 00:17:54,976
Why don't you check out
of that motel

369
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,878
and come and stay with me
while you're here?

370
00:17:56,912 --> 00:17:58,146
You're starting
a new business.

371
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,814
You're going to need
to save your money now.

372
00:17:59,848 --> 00:18:01,282
No, no, no, no.
I couldn't do that.

373
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:02,884
I-I wouldn't want
to intrude.

374
00:18:02,918 --> 00:18:04,519
- Oh, you're not.
- Yeah, don't worry.

375
00:18:04,553 --> 00:18:06,621
I was going home
tonight anyway.

376
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:08,489
Why don't I bring you guys
breakfast in the morning?

377
00:18:08,524 --> 00:18:11,592
Best doughnuts
you ever tasted.

378
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:15,363
Okay.

379
00:18:38,287 --> 00:18:39,821
Aah! Aah! Oh!

380
00:18:39,855 --> 00:18:40,855
Aah!

381
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:42,156
What the hell
are you doing, man?

382
00:18:42,191 --> 00:18:43,324
Get out of here.

383
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:57,538
Mmm.
Mmm.

384
00:18:57,573 --> 00:19:00,408
Man, it's like I died
and went to heaven.

385
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:02,610
I think if I had
one more of those,

386
00:19:02,644 --> 00:19:03,744
I probably will.

387
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:06,013
I'd like to make
an orange juice toast

388
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:09,350
to the cutest damn couple
I have ever seen--

389
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:11,118
outside of me and Bubba
in prison.

390
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:13,187
That's just a little joke.

391
00:19:13,222 --> 00:19:14,655
Right.

392
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,024
Well,
to you, Dad,

393
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:18,526
the king of crawfish.

394
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,395
There's
no stopping me.

395
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:26,400
I just gotta get
the money together.

396
00:19:27,469 --> 00:19:28,870
So where are you
at with that?

397
00:19:28,904 --> 00:19:30,204
Well, actually,

398
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:31,873
that's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

399
00:19:31,907 --> 00:19:35,276
I figured you might like
to get in on the ground floor.

400
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,245
- What do you mean?
- Well, you know, invest.

401
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,313
I only need
about 20 grand more.

402
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:40,848
Oh, wow.

403
00:19:40,883 --> 00:19:42,383
No,
it's a great opportunity.

404
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:44,352
I mean, there's
a guaranteed 10% a year back

405
00:19:44,386 --> 00:19:45,419
on your investment.

406
00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:48,556
I'm sorry, Dad.
I-I can't.

407
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,625
All my money's tied up
in the business.

408
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:53,027
Aw, come on, now.
Not all your money.

409
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:54,428
I mean, there's got to be
a little wiggle room

410
00:19:54,463 --> 00:19:55,630
in there somewhere.

411
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:57,398
I'm sure you could
remortgage your place.

412
00:19:57,432 --> 00:19:58,733
I don't think so.

413
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:00,401
No, this place has got to be
worth a pretty penny.

414
00:20:00,435 --> 00:20:01,636
Dad, it's not
going to happen.

415
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,106
Well, fine.
Whatever.

416
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,608
Forget it.

417
00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:09,544
I'm sorry.
I just don't have the funds.

418
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:10,745
What kind of daughter

419
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:12,413
won't even help out
her own fucking father?

420
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:14,916
Jesus, Dad.

421
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,653
Look, I need some air.
I'm going to go for a drive.

422
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:22,256
Dad,
you don't have to go.

423
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:27,428
You think
I was wrong,

424
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:28,596
telling him
I couldn't give him the money?

425
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,797
Of course not.

426
00:20:29,831 --> 00:20:32,266
But I feel like
I should help him out.

427
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,970
Why?

428
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:40,007
Because he's my dad.

429
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:42,743
The same dad
who almost let you drown?

430
00:20:42,778 --> 00:20:44,512
Who left you alone
in a hotel for three days?

431
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:46,847
He's trying
to change.

432
00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:48,182
I doubt it.

433
00:20:48,216 --> 00:20:49,283
Look, I know he's done
some bad things,

434
00:20:49,318 --> 00:20:53,588
but there's good
inside of him, as well.

435
00:20:53,622 --> 00:20:55,623
Oh, right,
you've known him for, what,

436
00:20:55,657 --> 00:20:57,858
24 hours, and you think
you understand him?

437
00:20:57,893 --> 00:20:59,293
Well, I have a sense
for this sort of thing.

438
00:20:59,328 --> 00:21:01,629
Oh, yeah,
you and your dark--

439
00:21:01,663 --> 00:21:03,464
whatever--
part of you.

440
00:21:03,498 --> 00:21:04,465
That you
don't think exists.

441
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:07,868
Because it doesn't.

442
00:21:15,277 --> 00:21:19,113
I gotta go to work.
It's the arsonist again.

443
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:21,882
Look, I'm just trying
to help here.

444
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:24,952
I know.
I know.

445
00:21:24,987 --> 00:21:28,322
I appreciate it.
I'm sorry.

446
00:21:28,357 --> 00:21:31,659
I'll be fine.
Go.

447
00:21:31,693 --> 00:21:35,463
Okay.

448
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:05,993
?

449
00:22:08,063 --> 00:22:09,330
Another "Bobby."

450
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:14,535
"It's Bobby."
He added an "it's."

451
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:15,870
Like we didn't know
it was Bobby.

452
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:19,840
Make sure
you get this.

453
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,554
Did you see Bosso?

454
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:34,855
He was sniffing
the body.

455
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:35,990
Probably for accelerant.

456
00:22:36,024 --> 00:22:38,659
Still, it was
kind of creepy, right?

457
00:22:38,694 --> 00:22:41,629
I mean, I know it would be
the biggest cliche in the world,

458
00:22:41,663 --> 00:22:43,698
the arson investigator
turned out to be the arsonist,

459
00:22:43,732 --> 00:22:46,767
but does he--

460
00:22:46,802 --> 00:22:49,437
does he set off anything
in your lizard brain?

461
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:52,073
I don't think
Bosso's the phantom.

462
00:22:52,107 --> 00:22:53,874
He has an alibi.
You vetted him?

463
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:56,544
I looked into him.

464
00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:57,545
You said
you weren't going to take

465
00:22:57,579 --> 00:22:58,746
any more cases
from the police.

466
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,648
- I didn't take it.
- Fuck, Dexter.

467
00:23:00,682 --> 00:23:03,317
Why would you put yourself
in that situation?

468
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:05,486
Good question.
Why did I?

469
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,921
Hey, L.T.

470
00:23:06,955 --> 00:23:08,255
We got
the security camera.

471
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,724
I'm going to take the hard drive
back down to the station

472
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:10,891
and see if we can get eyes
on the phantom.

473
00:23:10,926 --> 00:23:13,427
Good.
We could use a break.

474
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:20,301
Hey, Hannah.

475
00:23:20,335 --> 00:23:21,836
Wait, hold on.
Slow down.

476
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,272
What happened?

477
00:23:25,307 --> 00:23:26,307
I'll be right there.

478
00:23:29,344 --> 00:23:37,251
?

479
00:23:42,858 --> 00:23:45,426
What happened?

480
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,194
Ii came back
from the Flower Mart,

481
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:49,296
and it was like this.

482
00:23:49,331 --> 00:23:53,734
Oops.

483
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:56,604
Well, I had a couple of drinks
to take the edge off,

484
00:23:56,638 --> 00:23:59,206
but I guess I might have
overdone it a little.

485
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:00,875
You did this
to get back at me

486
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:02,943
for not giving you the money
that you wanted.

487
00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:06,347
Oh,
talk about paranoid.

488
00:24:06,381 --> 00:24:08,849
But then,
maybe you've got reason to be.

489
00:24:08,884 --> 00:24:10,518
Must be a whole lot
of folks hate you

490
00:24:10,552 --> 00:24:12,353
for all the pain
you've caused.

491
00:24:12,387 --> 00:24:14,155
How can you even
say that to me?

492
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:16,090
Playing mother nature
in here

493
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:17,958
with your stupid,
little flowers,

494
00:24:17,993 --> 00:24:20,327
won't even help out
your own fucking father!

495
00:24:20,362 --> 00:24:21,962
Because I don't want
to help you!

496
00:24:21,997 --> 00:24:23,531
You got any idea
what it's like

497
00:24:23,565 --> 00:24:26,934
to be the father
of the infamous Hannah McKay?

498
00:24:26,968 --> 00:24:31,172
You're a goddamn curse,
you ungrateful little shit!

499
00:24:31,206 --> 00:24:32,306
That's enough, Clint.

500
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,675
You stay out of this.
This is family business.

501
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:39,547
You know you killed
your mother, don't you?

502
00:24:39,581 --> 00:24:41,015
She died
of a broken heart

503
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:43,651
after your spree
with Wayne Randall.

504
00:24:43,685 --> 00:24:44,852
I'm sorry.

505
00:24:44,886 --> 00:24:46,654
Everybody would have been
a lot better off

506
00:24:46,688 --> 00:24:47,688
if I'd let you drown

507
00:24:47,722 --> 00:24:51,859
that day at the pond.

508
00:24:51,893 --> 00:24:55,596
Get out of here.

509
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:01,836
Now.

510
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,218
Fine.

511
00:25:06,775 --> 00:25:09,677
I said
what I had to say.

512
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:19,386
Well, it looks like Hannah's
found herself another winner.

513
00:25:19,421 --> 00:25:21,322
You two
deserve each other.

514
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:36,337
I can cut a body up
into pieces,

515
00:25:36,371 --> 00:25:39,306
but how do I help Hannah
put herself back together?

516
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:50,851
Could you have picked
more of a dump?

517
00:25:50,886 --> 00:25:52,653
Come on, Maria.

518
00:25:52,687 --> 00:25:54,588
It's perfect for all this
cloak and dagger bullshit.

519
00:25:54,623 --> 00:25:57,758
It's the kind of place you take
hookers and ugly broads.

520
00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:58,759
And also,
nobody sees you.

521
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:01,395
You should know,
I followed up

522
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:03,397
on all the names
you identified on my list.

523
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:06,400
Yes, the list
of suspicious police employees

524
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:07,501
who own boats.

525
00:26:07,535 --> 00:26:08,969
Yes.
They were all dead ends.

526
00:26:09,004 --> 00:26:10,938
All except
for Dexter Morgan,

527
00:26:10,972 --> 00:26:13,607
who conveniently
moved his boat

528
00:26:13,642 --> 00:26:15,542
right when we were closing in
on his marina

529
00:26:15,577 --> 00:26:17,645
during the official Bay Harbor
Butcher investigation.

530
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,714
You really think Dexter
is the Bay Harbor Butcher?

531
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:22,516
It's worth
looking into.

532
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,984
No,
it's a waste of time.

533
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:25,886
Now, look, you have
to start thinking logically.

534
00:26:25,921 --> 00:26:30,024
If Doakes really wasn't
the Bay Harbor Butcher,

535
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:32,259
then that means that somebody
probably framed him.

536
00:26:32,294 --> 00:26:33,560
Right.

537
00:26:33,595 --> 00:26:34,695
Which means that same person
probably killed him,

538
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:37,464
most likely
the real Bay Harbor Butcher.

539
00:26:37,499 --> 00:26:39,400
So the best thing
to do is to look

540
00:26:39,434 --> 00:26:41,936
into Doakes' final days.

541
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:45,272
We should start with the cabin
in the Everglades.

542
00:26:45,307 --> 00:26:47,908
Where Doakes died.

543
00:26:47,943 --> 00:26:49,610
Makes sense.
First let's eat.

544
00:26:49,644 --> 00:26:51,078
- Okay.
- Waiter.

545
00:26:57,819 --> 00:27:01,889
Oh, wow.

546
00:27:01,923 --> 00:27:03,490
You went all out.

547
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:04,792
Well,
you had a rough night.

548
00:27:04,826 --> 00:27:08,595
I figured you could use
a pick-me-up.

549
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,897
Sit.

550
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:21,642
You were right
about my dad.

551
00:27:21,676 --> 00:27:24,144
I'm sorry
I was.

552
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,547
I just--
I feel like such a sucker.

553
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:28,649
You know, I don't fall
for anybody's bullshit,

554
00:27:28,683 --> 00:27:29,783
but when it comes
to him, I--

555
00:27:29,818 --> 00:27:33,120
I get it.
Fathers can be complicated.

556
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:35,956
I just don't understand why I
keep holding on to this idea

557
00:27:35,991 --> 00:27:39,827
that, underneath it all,
he's a good person.

558
00:27:39,861 --> 00:27:41,462
Maybe because the idea
that he's not

559
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:43,097
is just too hard
to take.

560
00:27:49,371 --> 00:27:51,905
Well, I just hope
he's gone for good.

561
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:57,511
You sure
scared the shit out of him.

562
00:27:57,545 --> 00:28:00,748
That voice--

563
00:28:00,782 --> 00:28:02,182
I hadn't seen that look
on your face

564
00:28:02,217 --> 00:28:07,488
since you took me
to see the snow.

565
00:28:07,522 --> 00:28:09,990
Is that
what you were talking about?

566
00:28:10,025 --> 00:28:12,993
Your dark...
rider?

567
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,831
Dark passenger.

568
00:28:20,502 --> 00:28:21,702
Okay, fine.

569
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:23,504
It sounds a little silly
when you say it out loud.

570
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:24,705
No, I-I get
what you mean, you know.

571
00:28:24,739 --> 00:28:26,473
You do seem like
a different person,

572
00:28:26,508 --> 00:28:30,511
so it makes sense that you would
name that part of yourself.

573
00:28:34,716 --> 00:28:37,184
Does it
just take over?

574
00:28:42,424 --> 00:28:44,725
Where do you go?

575
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:49,496
Does Dexter Morgan
just disappear?

576
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:54,601
No,
I'm still there.

577
00:28:54,636 --> 00:28:56,203
Do you hear a voice,
or--

578
00:28:56,237 --> 00:28:57,204
Not exactly.

579
00:28:57,238 --> 00:29:02,409
It's more like a need.

580
00:29:02,444 --> 00:29:04,711
So it's just
like a feeling.

581
00:29:18,293 --> 00:29:20,961
Well,
I should get to work.

582
00:29:20,995 --> 00:29:21,962
Unless you need me to--

583
00:29:21,996 --> 00:29:25,232
No, I'm good.
I got pancakes.

584
00:29:41,116 --> 00:29:42,783
Okay, the good news
is that we have

585
00:29:42,817 --> 00:29:44,485
the phantom
entering the bus.

586
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:47,721
The bad news is
that he never shows his face.

587
00:29:58,466 --> 00:30:02,069
My promise to Deb is getting
harder and harder to keep.

588
00:30:02,103 --> 00:30:03,604
This is more
than just a feeling.

589
00:30:03,638 --> 00:30:04,838
There's no way
to I.D. him?

590
00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:07,307
I didn't say that.

591
00:30:10,478 --> 00:30:12,713
Right there.

592
00:30:12,747 --> 00:30:15,616
He grabs a rail bare-handed.
We might have a print.

593
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,683
Halle-fucking-lujah.

594
00:30:16,718 --> 00:30:17,784
Pull the fucking print
off the rail,

595
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:19,453
and we might get lucky
and get a match.

596
00:30:19,487 --> 00:30:20,521
All right.
Let's go, bro.

597
00:30:21,556 --> 00:30:23,223
Hey, baby.
What's up?

598
00:30:23,258 --> 00:30:25,425
What?
Whoa, whoa.

599
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,493
Motherfuck.
I'll be right there.

600
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:27,961
What's wrong?

601
00:30:27,996 --> 00:30:29,296
Fucking Novikov's
sending Nadia

602
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,597
to work at a sex club
in Dubai.

603
00:30:30,632 --> 00:30:31,598
He's holding her
at the Fox Hole.

604
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:32,799
I gotta get her
out of there.

605
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:33,901
- You're going alone?
- I got no choice.

606
00:30:33,935 --> 00:30:35,169
He's putting her
on a flight tonight.

607
00:30:35,203 --> 00:30:36,603
You're going to need backup.
Let's go.

608
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:40,674
Where do you think
you're going?

609
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,943
I'm here
to see George.

610
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:46,880
Why don't you
stay here?

611
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:49,983
Hmm?

612
00:30:52,854 --> 00:30:55,355
Well, well,
if it isn't Sir Lancelot.

613
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:59,092
- Where's Nadia?
- Nadia?

614
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:00,360
Let me go get her
for you.

615
00:31:00,395 --> 00:31:02,996
She's got something
to tell you.

616
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:05,599
Get over here.

617
00:31:08,136 --> 00:31:10,671
All right, tell your boyfriend
who you belong to.

618
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:11,738
Let her go.

619
00:31:11,773 --> 00:31:13,106
- Tell him.
- Fuck you.

620
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:17,010
You touch her a-fucking-gain,
you're dead.

621
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:19,112
Oh, what are you going
to do, Mr. Policeman?

622
00:31:19,147 --> 00:31:22,015
You're going to shoot me
in my own club?

623
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:24,017
Fuck.

624
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:26,687
Don't move.

625
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:29,590
Nadia,
get behind George's body.

626
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:31,291
I want you
to take this gun, Nadia--

627
00:31:33,661 --> 00:31:35,729
I want you to shoot me
in the arm.

628
00:31:35,763 --> 00:31:36,830
Okay, sweetie?

629
00:31:36,864 --> 00:31:37,831
It's okay.

630
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:38,832
Shoot me in the arm.

631
00:31:43,905 --> 00:31:46,006
What the hell--
are you okay?

632
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,975
I'm fine.
He pulled a gun and shot me.

633
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:51,311
I had no fucking choice.
He just grazed me.

634
00:31:51,346 --> 00:31:53,313
- Christ.
- Go to the safe.

635
00:31:53,348 --> 00:31:56,550
Get your passport
and the money and go.

636
00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:58,485
What?
She's a witness.

637
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,820
I'm not going to let her
take that money.

638
00:31:59,854 --> 00:32:02,356
She's earned it.
She can't be a witness.

639
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,657
The Koshkas
will kill her.

640
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:06,393
And she's here
illegally.

641
00:32:17,905 --> 00:32:19,373
I'm sorry.

642
00:32:19,407 --> 00:32:22,376
It's okay.
Go, go, now.

643
00:32:33,855 --> 00:32:35,622
So did you find
a match?

644
00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:37,057
We'll see.

645
00:32:37,091 --> 00:32:41,862
I'm running the phantom's prints
through A.F.I.S. now.

646
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:43,530
Nothing.
Fuck me.

647
00:32:43,564 --> 00:32:45,065
So what now?

648
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:46,867
You hand the whole thing
over to me

649
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:48,535
and let me take care
of it my way?

650
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:51,271
I can't stop thinking
about this "Bobby" thing.

651
00:32:51,306 --> 00:32:54,641
You know, that somehow,
that's the key.

652
00:32:54,676 --> 00:32:58,412
It's a kid's name.
Nobody calls an adult Bobby.

653
00:32:58,446 --> 00:32:59,746
He wrote "it's Bobby"
on the bus.

654
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:02,416
Sounds like Astor and Cody,
blaming each other.

655
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,717
"It's Astor."
"It's Cody."

656
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:05,052
You think the fires
have something to do

657
00:33:05,086 --> 00:33:06,053
with his childhood?

658
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:07,754
Could be.

659
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:09,389
Maybe his urges
started back then.

660
00:33:09,424 --> 00:33:11,491
I wish we could run that print
against the juvie records,

661
00:33:11,526 --> 00:33:14,628
but that shit's sealed.

662
00:33:15,663 --> 00:33:19,499
Back to square one.

663
00:33:19,534 --> 00:33:22,502
Not for me.

664
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:33,547
?

665
00:33:45,326 --> 00:33:48,662
Government workers
never miss a break.

666
00:34:15,123 --> 00:34:17,624
There's your phantom.

667
00:34:17,658 --> 00:34:21,661
Arrested for burning down
his school's gym at age 12.

668
00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:25,132
Spent some time in detention,
set his roommate's bunk on fire.

669
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:29,603
Got sent to
a psychiatric facility in 2006.

670
00:34:31,205 --> 00:34:34,141
That explains why the fires
only just started now.

671
00:34:36,377 --> 00:34:38,145
You going to turn that
over to Deb?

672
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:40,046
Call it in
on the tip line?

673
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:41,615
I'm not sure I can.

674
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:42,916
Deb was right.

675
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:46,286
Now that I have proof,
my urges are beyond my control.

676
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,421
Your dark passenger.

677
00:34:47,455 --> 00:34:49,923
Where did you come up
with that, anyway?

678
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:51,057
I thought I got it
from you.

679
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:52,325
I gave you
the code.

680
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,797
The dark passenger
was all yours.

681
00:34:56,831 --> 00:34:58,799
You said it got
into me too early,

682
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,000
in that shipping container.

683
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:01,468
Like you thought
I was possessed.

684
00:35:01,502 --> 00:35:03,069
I meant you were traumatized,
Dexter.

685
00:35:03,104 --> 00:35:06,006
Not possessed.

686
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,274
I remember the first time
you said it.

687
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:08,308
You must have been
about 12.

688
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:10,944
I just let it go.

689
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:12,779
I couldn't let you blame
yourself for feelings

690
00:35:12,814 --> 00:35:17,250
that were too complicated
for a young boy to understand.

691
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:19,252
But you're not
a boy anymore.

692
00:35:19,287 --> 00:35:22,355
- You sound like Hannah.
- Maybe she's right.

693
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:26,126
Maybe the dark passenger
is just a feeling.

694
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,695
- It can't be.
- Why?

695
00:35:28,729 --> 00:35:30,497
Because if there's
no dark passenger,

696
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:36,269
then I'm responsible
for everything I've done.

697
00:35:36,304 --> 00:35:38,638
It sure is a whole lot simpler
to just pin all the blame

698
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:43,643
on something else,
isn't it, Dexter?

699
00:35:43,678 --> 00:35:44,878
It's much scarier
to think

700
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:48,148
that the dark passenger
is no more real than I am.

701
00:35:55,356 --> 00:35:57,491
This is
where the cabin used to be.

702
00:35:57,525 --> 00:36:00,227
Yeah, before it got blown
to smithereens.

703
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:12,172
Juan Alonso?

704
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:14,241
I'm Captain Maria LaGuerta
from Miami Metro Homicide.

705
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:15,575
This is
Thomas Matthews.

706
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,244
What do you want?

707
00:36:17,278 --> 00:36:20,680
Were you the owner
of this property back in 2007?

708
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:22,749
And did you rent it,
at that time,

709
00:36:22,783 --> 00:36:23,750
to a James Doakes?

710
00:36:23,784 --> 00:36:25,051
The Bay Harbor Butcher.

711
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:26,887
No, no, no, no, no.

712
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:28,855
I told the cops back then,
I had nothing to do with that.

713
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,658
Then how did Mr. Doakes
come to be staying here?

714
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:34,127
I was renting the place
to Santos Jimenez.

715
00:36:34,161 --> 00:36:36,129
Jimenez?

716
00:36:36,163 --> 00:36:37,731
Some kind
of Colombian drug guy.

717
00:36:37,765 --> 00:36:39,366
Not that I knew it
at the time.

718
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,800
I would never rent
to a criminal.

719
00:36:40,835 --> 00:36:44,037
Of course not.

720
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:47,040
Now, why does that
sound so familiar?

721
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:51,978
Now I know why the name
Santos Jimenez rang a bell.

722
00:36:52,013 --> 00:36:53,847
He wasn't just
a drug runner.

723
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:55,315
He was one
of the three men responsible

724
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:59,085
for killing Dexter Morgan's
biological mother, Laura Moser.

725
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,254
- Moser?
- Yeah.

726
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:03,156
Some drug lord
put a hit out on her

727
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:07,294
because he found out
that she was Harry Morgan's C.I.

728
00:37:07,328 --> 00:37:10,497
She was butchered by Jimenez
with a chain saw

729
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:11,932
right in front of Dexter
and his brother Brian.

730
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:14,935
Brian Moser?

731
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:18,038
The Ice Truck killer,
that was Dexter's brother?

732
00:37:18,072 --> 00:37:20,340
Yeah.

733
00:37:20,374 --> 00:37:24,311
So that means
that Dexter

734
00:37:24,345 --> 00:37:26,446
watched his mother
get chopped up,

735
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,518
just like the Bay Harbor Butcher
chopped up his victims?

736
00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:33,787
So what are you saying?

737
00:37:33,821 --> 00:37:35,121
Where's Jimenez now?

738
00:37:35,156 --> 00:37:36,456
He disappeared.

739
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,457
Murdered
by the Bay Harbor Butcher?

740
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:38,758
Maybe.

741
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:40,961
So who was more likely
to want Jimenez dead,

742
00:37:40,995 --> 00:37:42,629
Doakes or Dexter?

743
00:37:42,663 --> 00:37:45,098
- Oh, come on, Maria.
- No, Tom.

744
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:46,566
We can't ignore
the facts.

745
00:37:46,601 --> 00:37:49,903
The Bay Harbor Butcher took
blood slides from his victims.

746
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:52,706
Dexter is
a blood spatter analyst.

747
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,840
And Doakes
always thought

748
00:37:53,874 --> 00:37:56,776
there was something off
about Dexter.

749
00:37:56,811 --> 00:38:01,014
What if Doakes
was on to him?

750
00:38:01,048 --> 00:38:02,248
Jesus.

751
00:38:02,283 --> 00:38:05,652
What if Dexter is
the real Bay Harbor Butcher?

752
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:08,521
What if he isn't?

753
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:10,023
I am going
to go question him.

754
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:12,592
No, no, no.
You're not going to do that.

755
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:14,160
Now, I don't think
you're right about this.

756
00:38:14,195 --> 00:38:17,297
Trust me,
I hope I'm not.

757
00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:18,665
If somebody's got
to talk to Dexter,

758
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:20,467
it's going to be me.

759
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:21,534
I've known him
since he was a kid.

760
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:23,336
He trusts me.

761
00:38:23,371 --> 00:38:25,438
What's more, I'm a lot
less likely to fuck it up.

762
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:33,113
The only thing
that stands between me

763
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:34,180
and killing
the phantom

764
00:38:34,215 --> 00:38:38,618
is a slightly deflated
water wing.

765
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:40,687
You sure we can't talk you
into coming for a swim?

766
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:41,855
Yeah, I'd love to,

767
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:44,190
but I got something
I gotta take care of.

768
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:45,625
Here, put your hand
through there.

769
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,662
Boom.

770
00:38:48,696 --> 00:38:51,197
Do this one too.

771
00:38:51,232 --> 00:38:52,532
There you go.

772
00:38:59,106 --> 00:39:01,474
Well, well.
Who's this big fella?

773
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:04,044
That's my son,
Harrison.

774
00:39:04,078 --> 00:39:07,447
Harrison.
Isn't that fancy?

775
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:08,548
And who are you?

776
00:39:08,582 --> 00:39:11,217
I'm Jamie,
Harrison's nanny.

777
00:39:11,252 --> 00:39:12,419
Boy.

778
00:39:12,453 --> 00:39:16,256
They didn't have nannies
like you back in my day.

779
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,091
We're going to go
swimming now.

780
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:20,760
You ready?
Ready, little man?

781
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:22,295
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

782
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:25,265
Whoo.

783
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:27,734
Boy, the way
they coddle kids today.

784
00:39:27,768 --> 00:39:30,970
You know, they're all going
to be expecting a helping hand.

785
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:32,205
The world
isn't like that.

786
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:36,209
It's sink or swim,
Sonny boy.

787
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:39,212
Have fun.

788
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,386
What do you want?

789
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,423
Well, Dexter, I can tell
that you care about my daughter.

790
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:51,424
I'm just here
to find out how much.

791
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:52,425
Get to the point.

792
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,927
I have some information

793
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:56,563
that could be very damaging
to Hannah.

794
00:39:56,597 --> 00:39:58,565
Now,
I could give

795
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,433
this information
to the police,

796
00:40:00,468 --> 00:40:02,368
or you could pay me
a nice, tidy sum

797
00:40:02,403 --> 00:40:03,436
to keep it to myself.

798
00:40:03,471 --> 00:40:04,771
What are you
talking about?

799
00:40:04,805 --> 00:40:06,406
When Hannah
got out of juvie,

800
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:11,277
she killed a counselor
at a halfway house.

801
00:40:11,312 --> 00:40:13,513
She fed him
rat poison.

802
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:15,882
Her roommate,
little gal named Arlene Shram,

803
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:20,153
saw her do it
with her own two eyes.

804
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:22,388
I figured the cops
could get her to spill her guts.

805
00:40:22,423 --> 00:40:24,991
You're lying.

806
00:40:25,025 --> 00:40:26,893
I read Sal Price's book
on Hannah.

807
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:29,062
He mentioned the counselor
but nothing about the roommate.

808
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:30,964
Because I hadn't told him
about it yet.

809
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:31,998
What?

810
00:40:32,032 --> 00:40:33,867
Where do you think
he was getting

811
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:36,736
all those juicy,
little plums?

812
00:40:36,771 --> 00:40:39,372
Price was paying me
to dish dirt on my daughter.

813
00:40:39,406 --> 00:40:43,176
But I was saving the good stuff
for a bigger payday.

814
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,545
Then the son of a bitch
went belly-up,

815
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:47,947
and...pfft.
There went my meal ticket.

816
00:40:47,982 --> 00:40:50,016
You'd sell
your own daughter out

817
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,284
for a crawfish farm?

818
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:53,052
Fuck crawfish, man.

819
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:56,523
I'm up to my ears
in gambling debt.

820
00:40:56,557 --> 00:40:59,659
But you do
what you gotta do.

821
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:05,031
So you going
to give me my money,

822
00:41:05,065 --> 00:41:06,399
or do I send Hannah
to jail?

823
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,276
Get out of here
before you see my bad side.

824
00:41:17,511 --> 00:41:20,413
You might want to ask Hannah
about Arlene

825
00:41:20,447 --> 00:41:24,617
before you come
to a final decision.

826
00:41:24,652 --> 00:41:27,086
Then we'll talk numbers.

827
00:41:34,228 --> 00:41:37,030
What exactly
were you doing here?

828
00:41:37,064 --> 00:41:39,365
It was
a personal matter.

829
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,202
My girlfriend
works at the club.

830
00:41:42,236 --> 00:41:43,703
Jesus, Quinn.

831
00:41:43,737 --> 00:41:46,005
I came here to talk
to Novikov about Nadia.

832
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,208
The conversation
got heated.

833
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:50,009
He pulled out a gun
and shot me.

834
00:41:50,044 --> 00:41:52,712
I returned fire.
Self-defense.

835
00:41:52,746 --> 00:41:53,780
Plain and simple.

836
00:41:53,814 --> 00:41:54,981
Well, write up a report.

837
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:58,484
I want it on my desk
in the morning.

838
00:42:02,723 --> 00:42:06,292
There's a little problem
with your story.

839
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:09,996
There was a time lag between
the first shot and the second.

840
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,833
I want the truth.

841
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,671
I told you
the truth.

842
00:42:18,706 --> 00:42:20,840
I went down
when George shot me.

843
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:24,143
He started to beat
the shit out of Nadia.

844
00:42:24,178 --> 00:42:25,912
I reached
for my gun.

845
00:42:25,946 --> 00:42:29,716
He wheeled around,
ready to blow my head off,

846
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,818
and I took him out.

847
00:42:31,852 --> 00:42:35,355
That's what happened.

848
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:40,426
Okay.
Then we'll go with that.

849
00:42:40,461 --> 00:42:43,696
Minus Nadia.

850
00:42:50,604 --> 00:42:52,605
Hey.
Where's Dexter?

851
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,706
I don't know.

852
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:54,707
But I'd like
to point out the fact

853
00:42:54,742 --> 00:42:56,809
that I am here,
doing my duty.

854
00:42:56,844 --> 00:42:58,211
- What?
- Nothing.

855
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:03,549
I feel like
I'm going to be sick.

856
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:06,019
How can that be
my own father?

857
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:16,596
I'm sorry to have
to tell you all this,

858
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,232
but I needed to know
that he was telling the truth.

859
00:43:21,535 --> 00:43:23,236
Arlene Shram
is the only person

860
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,705
who can put me in jail.

861
00:43:27,308 --> 00:43:31,044
She saw me put poison
in that counselor's food.

862
00:43:31,078 --> 00:43:32,912
I'm going to have
to pay him.

863
00:43:32,947 --> 00:43:34,080
That's not going
to solve anything.

864
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:35,248
He's just going
to come back.

865
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:38,084
Well, I don't see
any other option.

866
00:43:39,954 --> 00:43:41,788
When other people
have threatened you,

867
00:43:41,822 --> 00:43:44,590
you've found
other options.

868
00:43:48,662 --> 00:43:52,932
I can't.
He's my father.

869
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:02,875
I'm going
to call my bank.

870
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,244
I know
what you're thinking.

871
00:44:05,279 --> 00:44:09,248
I'm not thinking
anything.

872
00:44:09,283 --> 00:44:14,654
Clint McKay
doesn't meet the code.

873
00:44:14,688 --> 00:44:17,390
But Joseph Jensen does.

874
00:44:20,427 --> 00:44:28,401
?

875
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:26,793
It's not
as much fun

876
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:28,728
when you're not wearing
your suit, is it?

877
00:45:28,762 --> 00:45:31,731
Who-who are you?
I can't see you.

878
00:45:31,765 --> 00:45:34,801
Maybe I'm a phantom.

879
00:45:34,835 --> 00:45:37,303
Then again,
maybe not.

880
00:45:37,337 --> 00:45:38,938
A phantom
can't hurt you.

881
00:45:38,972 --> 00:45:42,108
Oh, God.
Please don't.

882
00:45:42,142 --> 00:45:44,410
- Who's Bobby?
- Let me go.

883
00:45:44,445 --> 00:45:46,512
Stop whining.

884
00:45:46,547 --> 00:45:48,981
Who's Bobby?

885
00:45:49,016 --> 00:45:53,920
Bobby Hamilton,
my best friend when I was 12.

886
00:45:53,954 --> 00:45:55,955
That's when you set
your first fire.

887
00:45:55,989 --> 00:45:59,225
I didn't set it.
Bobby did.

888
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:01,360
It was all his idea.

889
00:46:01,395 --> 00:46:03,496
But then he died,
and I got caught.

890
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:06,299
They sent me to the nuthouse,
like I was crazy.

891
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:08,367
It's all because of Bobby.
Fucking asshole.

892
00:46:08,402 --> 00:46:10,837
So does he still talk
to you?

893
00:46:10,871 --> 00:46:13,339
Is Bobby the one telling you
to set these fires?

894
00:46:13,373 --> 00:46:15,108
No,
that would make me crazy,

895
00:46:15,142 --> 00:46:16,542
and I'm not
fucking crazy!

896
00:46:16,577 --> 00:46:19,078
But I only hurt people
because of Bobby.

897
00:46:19,113 --> 00:46:21,781
No, you're the one
who's setting those fires.

898
00:46:21,815 --> 00:46:23,783
You're the one
who's burning people alive.

899
00:46:23,817 --> 00:46:25,118
You can't blame it
on something

900
00:46:25,152 --> 00:46:27,587
that happened to you
when you were a kid.

901
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:28,754
You're not
a kid anymore.

902
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:34,360
It's time for you
to take responsibility.

903
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:43,536
Fuck.

904
00:46:46,573 --> 00:46:51,210
?

905
00:46:51,245 --> 00:46:55,014
The caller said
they smelled kerosene.

906
00:46:55,048 --> 00:46:58,184
Looks like we have
the right place.

907
00:47:11,198 --> 00:47:14,934
Holy shit.

908
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:17,203
That's Joe Jensen.
I interviewed this guy.

909
00:47:17,237 --> 00:47:20,106
Dumb fuck must have
passed out from the fumes.

910
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,774
He's still alive.

911
00:47:21,808 --> 00:47:23,943
I guess
we found our phantom.

912
00:47:23,977 --> 00:47:27,513
Who'd have thought
it would be so easy?

913
00:47:27,548 --> 00:47:28,548
Yeah.

914
00:47:28,582 --> 00:47:31,551
Guys, come on down.

915
00:47:40,294 --> 00:47:41,594
Got your call.

916
00:47:41,628 --> 00:47:43,729
Glad you came
to your senses.

917
00:47:43,764 --> 00:47:44,730
You got my money?

918
00:47:44,765 --> 00:47:46,732
Yeah.
It's right back here.

919
00:47:50,404 --> 00:47:52,572
What's
with all the plastic?

920
00:47:57,344 --> 00:47:59,512
You'll find out soon.

921
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:10,489
?

922
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:20,199
What the hell?

923
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:21,701
I realize
this isn't the best way

924
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:26,439
to make a good impression
on your girlfriend's father.

925
00:48:30,177 --> 00:48:32,445
But I can't allow you
to hurt Hannah.

926
00:48:32,479 --> 00:48:34,413
Oh, please.

927
00:48:34,448 --> 00:48:37,283
I won't talk to the cops.
I'll leave town.

928
00:48:37,317 --> 00:48:40,253
I promise, I'll never come
near Hannah again.

929
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:43,522
I wish
I could believe you.

930
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:45,825
Actually, I don't, 'cause then,
I couldn't kill you.

931
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:47,727
Oh, please,
you don't have to do this.

932
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:49,362
That's what I'm realizing.

933
00:48:49,396 --> 00:48:52,698
I don't have to.

934
00:48:52,733 --> 00:48:56,469
But I want to.

935
00:48:56,503 --> 00:48:58,004
Even though
you don't meet my code,

936
00:48:58,038 --> 00:49:02,008
I really,
really want to.

937
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:06,812
Because, unlike you,
I care about Hannah.

938
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:13,753
You got the devil
inside you, boy.

939
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:18,024
No, I think
it's just me.

940
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:35,141
Sink or swim, daddy.

941
00:49:46,453 --> 00:49:47,586
Hey, Deb.

942
00:49:47,621 --> 00:49:50,589
We arrested the phantom,
thanks to you.

943
00:49:50,624 --> 00:49:52,525
Now I know
why you weren't at the Fox Hole.

944
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:53,926
Consider it a gift.

945
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,928
Bullshit.
You want something in return.

946
00:49:55,962 --> 00:49:59,265
And I'm guessing it's for me
to lay off your girlfriend.

947
00:49:59,299 --> 00:50:00,700
Well,
now that you mention it.

948
00:50:00,734 --> 00:50:03,169
Forget it.

949
00:50:03,203 --> 00:50:06,539
I always give in to you.

950
00:50:06,573 --> 00:50:09,675
But not anymore.

951
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,243
I understand.

952
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:24,390
I got the money
for my dad.

953
00:50:24,424 --> 00:50:26,459
I left him a message.

954
00:50:26,493 --> 00:50:29,395
He should be here soon.

955
00:50:31,565 --> 00:50:34,200
- He won't be coming.
- How do you know?

956
00:50:39,606 --> 00:50:42,508
I had a talk
with him.

957
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:43,809
I made it clear

958
00:50:43,844 --> 00:50:49,348
that I wouldn't allow him
to hurt you anymore.

959
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:53,953
And I think
he understood.

960
00:50:53,987 --> 00:50:55,988
So he's gone?

961
00:50:56,022 --> 00:50:58,457
He won't be
bothering you again.

962
00:51:05,999 --> 00:51:08,000
Thank you.

963
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,837
The dark passenger
has been with me

964
00:51:11,872 --> 00:51:12,972
ever since
I can remember,

965
00:51:13,006 --> 00:51:17,610
pulling the strings,
running the show.

966
00:51:17,644 --> 00:51:20,713
But as it turns out,
I'm no puppet.

967
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:22,515
And you should know,
you were right.

968
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:24,316
About what?

969
00:51:24,351 --> 00:51:29,755
The dark...rider.

970
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:35,428
He doesn't exist.

971
00:51:41,868 --> 00:51:43,269
Turns out,
maybe you understand me

972
00:51:43,303 --> 00:51:47,973
a little better
than I understand myself.

973
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:52,411
I love you.

974
00:52:01,321 --> 00:52:02,955
I think
I love you too.

975
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:26,879
Hey.
I need your help.

976
00:52:26,913 --> 00:52:29,381
We need to find a woman
named Arlene Shram.

977
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:31,183
Sure.
Who's that?

978
00:52:31,218 --> 00:52:33,552
According to a message
I got last night

979
00:52:33,587 --> 00:52:35,921
from Hannah McKay's father,

980
00:52:35,956 --> 00:52:39,325
she's a witness
to a murder.
