4
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:48,139
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

5
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,641
Our primary suspect

6
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:51,976
is Sergeant James Doakes.

7
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,411
Doakes?

8
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:55,914
If Doakes really wasn't
the Bay Harbor Butcher,

9
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:58,483
the best thing to do is to look
into Doakes's final days.

10
00:01:58,517 --> 00:02:01,653
We should start with the cabin
in the Everglades

11
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:04,389
where Doakes died.

12
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:06,457
I was renting the place
to Santos Jimenez.

13
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:07,759
Jimenez.

14
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:09,561
He was one
of the three men responsible

15
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:11,229
for killing Dexter Morgan's
biological mother.

16
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:15,600
What if Dexter
is the real Bay Harbor Butcher?

17
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:17,969
If somebody's gonna talk
to Dexter, it's gonna be me.

18
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:20,939
Tell your boyfriend
who you belong to.

19
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:27,445
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Go. Go. Now.

20
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,614
He died
in my apartment.

21
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:31,683
Figured it would kick in
while Price was on the road.

22
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:33,117
A convenient auto accident.

23
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:35,053
How'd you do it?

24
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:36,921
Price liked to chew
on his pens.

25
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,223
The last one
had a little something on it.

26
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:40,625
She is a killer.

27
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:43,661
You will never be safe
with her.

28
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,430
When Hannah
got out of juvie,

29
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:48,566
she killed a counselor
at a halfway house.

30
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,935
She fed him rat poison.

31
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,137
Her roommate, a little gal
named Arlene Shram,

32
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,540
saw her do it.

33
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:58,576
He won't be bothering you
again.

34
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,011
I love you.

35
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:02,814
I think
I love you too.

36
00:03:04,883 --> 00:03:07,185
We need to find a woman
named Arlene Shram.

37
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:09,235
Sure.
Who's that?

38
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:11,504
According to a message
I got last night

39
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:13,839
from Hannah McKay's father,

40
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:15,441
she's a witness
to a murder.

41
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:25,150
I've never thought
about the future.

42
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:31,724
About growing old.

43
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,535
Maybe because the future
has never been kind

44
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,003
to people like me.

45
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:09,061
Or their loved ones.

46
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:10,496
Bye, Dad.

47
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,865
Bye, Harrison.

48
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:22,975
But suddenly my future
seems very possible.

49
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:33,919
And growing old
is not only a possibility.

50
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:36,589
It seems appealing.

51
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:53,405
Hello?

52
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,074
Am I speaking
with Dexter Morgan?

53
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:56,342
Yeah, that's right.

54
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:58,043
This is Dade County
Department of Corrections.

55
00:04:58,078 --> 00:04:59,912
Hector Estrada...
Wait. What?

56
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:01,580
- Is having a parole hearing.
- When?

57
00:05:01,615 --> 00:05:03,248
- This morning
at 10:00 a.m.

58
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:04,817
I know this is sudden.

59
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:08,020
Okay, thank you
for letting me know.

60
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:09,888
You're welcome, sir.

61
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,193
That was the Department
of Corrections.

62
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:16,595
Hector Estrada is up
for parole.

63
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,998
He thinks there's a good chance
he'll get it.

64
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:20,399
Estrada?

65
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:22,201
Remember, I told you
about my mother

66
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:23,902
and how she died?

67
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:26,605
Oh, God.

68
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,875
Was he--was he one of the men
that killed her?

69
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:33,412
He was the leader.
He gave the order.

70
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:35,047
What about the others?

71
00:05:38,551 --> 00:05:41,620
Dead.

72
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:43,922
Estrada is the last survivor.

73
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:48,260
I'm sure you'll have something
to say about that.

74
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:53,465
Look at it this way.

75
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,068
Maybe it's the universe
giving you a Christmas present.

76
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:01,040
No one but you
would see it that way.

77
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:09,081
Maybe killing Estrada will close
this chapter of my life...

78
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:14,420
and open me up
to a future with Hannah.

79
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:16,655
The panel has reviewed

80
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,590
all the pertinent data
in this matter.

81
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:22,428
We find that the prisoner meets
the requirements for parole

82
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:26,965
under the compassionate release
statute 463.

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,200
Have you read the statute?

84
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:30,469
Do you understand
your obligations?

85
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:34,673
I understand
what's expected of me.

86
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,242
I won't screw up.

87
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:39,878
At this time we invite
any victims present

88
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:44,717
to enter a statement either for
or against the board's decision.

89
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:47,986
I have no objection.

90
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:51,123
Nadia, it's me again.

91
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:52,825
This is my fifth message.

92
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:55,027
Just want to know
where you are.

93
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:56,295
Give me a call.

94
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,597
Did you get bad news?

95
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:01,133
Just trying
to find Nadia.

96
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:02,434
Hey.
Taking a survey.

97
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:04,803
Secret Santa this year
or no secret Santa?

98
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:08,607
I got enough presents
to buy, man.

99
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:10,275
Man, the Christmas spirit
around here

100
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,010
sucks big reindeer dicks.

101
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:13,612
Deb.

102
00:07:13,646 --> 00:07:16,181
I found Arlene Shram.

103
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:18,851
- Oh, fucking amazing.
- She's living out in Hialeah.

104
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:20,219
Two drug arrests
since juvie.

105
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:22,721
Has two kids
from different fathers.

106
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:24,490
Temporarily lost custody

107
00:07:24,524 --> 00:07:28,460
a year ago
due to her drug abuse.

108
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:29,728
Good to know.

109
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:30,729
We'll have to
go after her hard.

110
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:31,830
I might have to threaten
to take away

111
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:33,832
her mother of the year trophy.

112
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:36,401
Any luck in locating
Hannah's father?

113
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:37,636
No.
Zero.

114
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,837
He dropped the dime
on his daughter

115
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:40,205
and then skipped tn
like it was nothing.

116
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,608
Well, he's a drifter.
He could be anywhere.

117
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:44,943
Listen, um...

118
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:47,980
maybe we should let your brother
know what we're doing.

119
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:50,716
I mean, we're investigating
his girlfriend.

120
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,718
I already told Dexter that
if I found anything on Hannah,

121
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:54,486
that I'd act on it.

122
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:55,754
I still don't feel right
about this.

123
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:57,489
And I'm telling you
that it's my call.

124
00:07:57,524 --> 00:08:01,326
Okay?

125
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:03,829
Matthews made his choices.

126
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:06,598
Now he spends Christmas alone
with his boat.

127
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,367
How close was I
to the same fate?

128
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:10,836
Oh, hand me
one of those zip ties

129
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,604
on the table there,
will you?

130
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:20,546
Thanks.

131
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,149
Fucking Christmas lights.

132
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:27,019
Every year I put 'em up,

133
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:29,555
and every year I wonder
why I bothered.

134
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:31,857
You said you wanted
to see me.

135
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:34,526
Yeah.
Yeah, thanks for coming out.

136
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:38,297
Sit.

137
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:40,299
I wanted to give you
a heads up on this idea

138
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,835
that Captain LaGuerta's
got into her head.

139
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:43,969
What?

140
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:46,471
The Bay Harbor Butcher.

141
00:08:46,506 --> 00:08:49,641
Maria's convinced
that Doakes was innocent

142
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:53,979
and that the real killer
is still at large.

143
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:58,283
Actually, she thinks
it might be you.

144
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:01,687
Me?

145
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:03,255
I know.

146
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:06,024
Personally, I think she's had
one too many "mosquitos,"

147
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:08,260
or whatever they call
that goddamn drink.

148
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:12,497
But anyway,
here we are.

149
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:15,133
What makes her think
I'm the Bay Harbor Butcher?

150
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:16,702
She knows
your life story,

151
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:20,939
your childhood, what you saw
in that cargo container.

152
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:26,879
Most people...
that'd screw 'em up for life.

153
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:29,648
I mean, your brother went
through the same thing you did,

154
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:31,583
and look what happened to him.

155
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:37,055
He saw your mother dismembered
before his eyes,

156
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,926
and he went on
to dismember his own victims.

157
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,797
Drink?

158
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:48,033
No.

159
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:51,503
The Bay Harbor Butcher
also dismembered his victims.

160
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:55,674
Of course, your brother
wasn't the butcher.

161
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,710
The murders continued
after his death.

162
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:02,514
But it's weird, huh?

163
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,318
Another thing that's weird--

164
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:08,954
that cabin where Doakes died.

165
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:10,455
What about it?

166
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,892
Was rented
to a man named Jimenez.

167
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,094
He was one of the men
who killed your mother.

168
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:20,399
I mean,
what are the odds?

169
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:23,802
He's interrogating me.

170
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:29,207
You knew my father.
You've known me my whole life.

171
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:31,810
Do you think
I'm the Bay Harbor Butcher?

172
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:36,448
Of course not.

173
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:39,217
But if I don't ask
these questions,

174
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:42,321
Maria will.

175
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:45,991
You know, I always had
a bad feeling about Doakes.

176
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:51,029
He obviously didn't like me
too much

177
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:52,965
from the get-go.

178
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:57,002
Hmm.
Not exactly a secret.

179
00:10:57,036 --> 00:10:59,371
But then that whole Bay Harbor
Butcher case came along,

180
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:04,743
and something happened that I've
never told anyone about.

181
00:11:04,777 --> 00:11:07,612
- What?
- I saw Doakes on his boat.

182
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,915
Doakes had a boat?

183
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:10,916
Yeah.

184
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,150
I figured he used it

185
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:14,987
to dispose
of his victims.

186
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:19,191
He kept it
at the same marina as mine.

187
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:20,826
I moved my boat
to get away from him.

188
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,427
Why didn't you
ever come forward?

189
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:23,795
'Cause I didn't know
what he'd do to me

190
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,231
or my sister.

191
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:31,069
Yeah.

192
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:34,606
Doakes was
a pretty formidable guy.

193
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,641
Yeah.

194
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:39,845
I can imagine how scared
you must have been.

195
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:44,583
Sorry to put you
through all this, Dexter.

196
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:48,053
I'll talk to Maria.

197
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:50,822
Get her to move on.

198
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:52,758
No hard feelings?

199
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:55,027
None.

200
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:00,866
I've given them a boat
to search for.

201
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,267
Now I just have to make sure

202
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:04,636
there's something
for them to find.

203
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,305
Hey, don't splash your sister!

204
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,541
- Oh!
- I'm not gonna tell you again.

205
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:12,911
Sorry. They are nonstop.

206
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:15,147
No, I have a nephew
their age,

207
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:18,316
so I can relate.

208
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:21,520
Traded one vice
for another.

209
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:24,356
At least they can't take
your kids away for tobacco.

210
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,393
First Christmas clean and sober,
and it won't be the last.

211
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:30,896
Knock on wood.

212
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,697
Just want to keep
looking forward, you know?

213
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:35,233
That's kind of why I'm here,
Arlene.

214
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:38,804
To keep you looking forward.

215
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:40,172
To keep you out of jail,
actually.

216
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:42,307
Why would I be going
to jail?

217
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:45,377
As an accessory to murder.

218
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:47,913
He was a counselor
at a halfway house

219
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:49,514
where you resided
about ten years ago.

220
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:52,651
Someone spiked his coffee
with rat poison.

221
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:54,853
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

222
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:57,222
I'm not after you.
I'm after Hannah McKay.

223
00:12:57,256 --> 00:12:59,057
She was your roommate
at the time of the murder.

224
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:00,192
And I know
it was her idea,

225
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:01,493
but you had some part in it.

226
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:03,762
You either helped
or you kept quiet.

227
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:04,963
What do you want from me?

228
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:06,832
I want to know
exactly what happened.

229
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:09,868
And in return I will promise you
immunity from prosecution,

230
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:11,336
I will keep you out of jail,

231
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,572
and I'll make sure
that your kids have their mother

232
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:15,874
to put presents
under the tree.

233
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,780
I'd like some time
to think about this.

234
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:25,517
Okay, do that.

235
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:27,586
And play with your kids.

236
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,954
'Cause, depending
on what you decide,

237
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:32,357
you might not get to do that
for a really long time.

238
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:38,230
?

239
00:13:38,264 --> 00:13:39,865
Turn this way now.

240
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,601
Do you remember
the first and last time

241
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:44,736
dad took us to see Santa?

242
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,373
You yanked his beard,
and I asked for a gun.

243
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,210
Where the fuck are you,
the North Pole?

244
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:53,778
You haven't said anything
since we've been here.

245
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:56,314
What is it?

246
00:13:56,349 --> 00:13:58,250
You sure you want to know?

247
00:13:58,284 --> 00:14:00,418
Oh, Jesus.

248
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:02,087
Tell me.

249
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:05,490
LaGuerta's still looking
into the Bay Harbor Butcher.

250
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:06,791
Shit.

251
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:08,994
I talked to Matthews.

252
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:10,862
She's pulled him
into the investigation.

253
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:11,997
What?

254
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:15,066
It gets worse.

255
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:17,002
They think it's me.

256
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:20,305
You weren't gonna
fucking tell me?

257
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,274
Do they have anything?

258
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:26,011
I don't know.

259
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:29,915
I need to put them off this
once and for all.

260
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:31,283
How?

261
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:32,918
Give them definitive proof

262
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,553
that Doakes was the butcher.

263
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:36,721
It'll mean planting evidence.

264
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:41,793
You can't do that,
not with those two on your case.

265
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:44,429
I'll just have
to be very careful.

266
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:53,605
Now were you a good boy?

267
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,440
So what do you want
for Christmas?

268
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:57,943
Fuck it.
It's too risky for you.

269
00:14:57,977 --> 00:15:00,145
I'll do it.
Deb, no.

270
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:02,347
I'm not gonna let Harrison
grow up without a father.

271
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:03,648
I don't want
to argue about it.

272
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:06,718
I just want this to be the end
once and for all.

273
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:08,987
Hey, guys.

274
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:16,228
Hey.

275
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:20,565
Ready?
Say cheese, everyone.

276
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,169
Cheese.

277
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:26,538
I'm sorry, but I just
don't think Dexter Morgan

278
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:28,873
has anything to do
with the Bay Harbor Butcher.

279
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,108
You're letting
your personal feelings

280
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:32,711
for the Morgans completely cloud
your judgment.

281
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:34,913
And I think you're letting
whatever you had going

282
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:38,149
with Doakes make you blind
to his guilt.

283
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:39,818
I've heard of people
fucking their brains out,

284
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:41,186
Maria, but God almighty.

285
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,322
Well, that's low
even for you, Tom.

286
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:46,691
Look, let's just follow up
on this boat.

287
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:48,793
Look, if James had owned
a boat,

288
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:50,028
I would have known.

289
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:51,263
Well, call it
a wild guess,

290
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:53,198
but if he was using it
to dump his victims

291
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:55,400
into the ocean,
he probably would have tried

292
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:57,535
to keep its existence
a secret.

293
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,685
I swear, I never told anyone
I saw you poison that man.

294
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:18,723
I don't get how that stanky
detective could know about it.

295
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:21,393
Must have been my dad.

296
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:23,795
Why would he do that?

297
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:25,363
He needed money,
and I wouldn't give it to him.

298
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:28,266
You know my dad.

299
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:31,770
Yeah, unfortunately.

300
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:34,272
I can't go to jail, Hannah.

301
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:36,808
Losing my kids again?
I couldn't take it.

302
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:39,444
I'm not gonna let that happen.

303
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:41,880
Hey, look at me.

304
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:43,615
When that fucking counselor
was putting his hands on us

305
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:47,385
and I shut him down for good,
you backed me up.

306
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,121
We always stuck together.

307
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:52,891
That's not gonna change now,
is it?

308
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:58,630
But that detective's
gonna come back.

309
00:16:58,664 --> 00:17:00,298
She's not gonna let up.

310
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,835
I'm gonna figure
something out.

311
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:06,705
You just have
to stay strong, okay?

312
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:16,748
Not this one.

313
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:19,084
This one looks like Doakes.

314
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:31,329
Did you have to get
the biggest tree on the lot?

315
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:32,897
Well, anything smaller
than this

316
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:37,402
looks like
a Charlie Brown tree.

317
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:38,636
By the way, you still doing
Christmas day

318
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:40,605
with Debra and Harrison?

319
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:42,674
Yeah.
You can join us.

320
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:46,344
Not sure if Debra and me
in the same room

321
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:48,446
would be very Christmasy.

322
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:59,424
Okay.

323
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,093
Maybe we could start
a new tradition.

324
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:05,663
Christmas Eve this year

325
00:18:05,698 --> 00:18:08,099
and next year,
the year after that.

326
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:11,102
I like that.
Except there is one problem.

327
00:18:11,137 --> 00:18:12,504
What?

328
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:14,672
I haven't got you
a Christmas present yet.

329
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:17,809
I don't really
need anything.

330
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:19,978
Suit yourself.

331
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:21,379
I guess I'm just gonna have
to go out

332
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:24,949
and buy you
a pair of socks.

333
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:36,921
Hold up.
Hey. Hey.

334
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:38,890
That's not the walk
of a dying man.

335
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:41,926
I guess freedom
was the tonic he needed.

336
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:45,163
But I'll soon change that.

337
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,001
- Jenna.
- Hey, Quinn.

338
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:52,403
I'm looking for Nadia.
Do you know where she is?

339
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:55,039
Hey, pal,
find your own.

340
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:57,208
I'm sorry.
Does your wife know you're here?

341
00:19:57,243 --> 00:19:59,811
No.
So shut the fuck up.

342
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:01,412
Nadia's in Vegas.

343
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:03,381
Vegas?
What are you talking about?

344
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:04,682
She moved there to work.

345
00:20:04,717 --> 00:20:07,185
Got a job
in one of the casinos.

346
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:10,088
- When?
- Couple days ago.

347
00:20:10,122 --> 00:20:13,191
She left you a note.
It's in my locker.

348
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:14,859
I probably shouldn't he
read it.

349
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:16,227
What did it say?

350
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:19,163
That she's sorry
but that she needed a new start.

351
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:22,033
Staying here
was too hard for her.

352
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:23,968
She was really broken up.

353
00:20:26,238 --> 00:20:28,006
That all?

354
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,642
Oh, that you really
mean a lot to her

355
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:33,745
and she'll never forget
what you did for her.

356
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:37,282
I'll be done in a few minutes,
and I can go get it.

357
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:39,150
Thanks.

358
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:46,824
Last Christmas,
I was down in the keys.

359
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:49,894
This Christmas--
your garage.

360
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:51,763
No one's forcing you
to be here, Tom.

361
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:54,299
Oh, I'm too afraid
to leave you alone.

362
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,334
You might decide
I'm the Bay Harbor Butcher

363
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:58,970
and haul me in.

364
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:01,472
What is it?
Take a look.

365
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:05,877
It's a tackle box.

366
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:20,358
These are
deep-sea fishing lures.

367
00:21:20,392 --> 00:21:22,727
Meaning?

368
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:26,598
Meaning they're the kind
you need a boat to use.

369
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,659
Jeez, what a mess.

370
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:57,762
Well, it's been empty
for years.

371
00:21:57,796 --> 00:21:59,397
Doakes probably
scrapped his boat

372
00:21:59,431 --> 00:22:01,866
once we were closing in
on him.

373
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,068
We don't know
Doakes used this place.

374
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:08,039
You're jumping
to conclusions.

375
00:22:08,073 --> 00:22:12,443
This address came
from the tackle box...

376
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:15,880
Which came from the cabin
where Doakes died.

377
00:22:15,914 --> 00:22:18,182
This isn't jumping
to a conclusion.

378
00:22:18,217 --> 00:22:20,418
This conclusion's
hanging from your ass.

379
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:41,773
That private
forensics team of yours...

380
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:44,008
Yeah.
What about 'em?

381
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:46,444
Get 'em out here.

382
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:53,785
I think we just struck oil.

383
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,258
The blood's too degraded
to analyze,

384
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:03,094
but we found one print
on the hilt.

385
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:04,996
It's a match
for James Doakes.

386
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:09,834
You're certain?

387
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:12,670
No question, Captain.

388
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:15,006
Well, that sews it up.

389
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,043
Tom.

390
00:23:19,078 --> 00:23:22,346
This evidence could have
been planted.

391
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:25,416
Dexter is a forensics expert

392
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:26,884
and he has the skills--

393
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:30,621
- Maria, it's over.
The fat lady isn't singing.

394
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:32,457
Her song is done.
She's getting dry-humped

395
00:23:32,491 --> 00:23:35,359
in her dressing room.
Jesus Christ, Tom!

396
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:38,796
What is wrong with you?

397
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:41,799
Maria, why can't you
let this go?

398
00:23:46,438 --> 00:23:49,240
I guess
because I feel

399
00:23:49,274 --> 00:23:51,642
I owe it to James
to clear his name.

400
00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:55,613
Why?
Because you two were a couple?

401
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:57,982
Because he was innocent.

402
00:23:58,016 --> 00:24:00,885
You're not an investigator,
Maria.

403
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:03,087
Your talent's
in playing the game,

404
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:05,389
and you play a great one.

405
00:24:05,424 --> 00:24:07,592
Hell, you beat me.

406
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:10,061
But either way...

407
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:12,230
I'm done here.

408
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:15,767
Now, I expect you to live up
to your end of the bargain.

409
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:18,636
40-year pay scale
on my pension.

410
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:24,742
I remember, Tom.

411
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:27,111
Don't worry.
You'll get what's coming to you.

412
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:31,048
I expect to.

413
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,317
<i>Feliz navidad,</i> Maria.

414
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:50,535
What the hell
are you doing here?

415
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:52,503
Don't tell me
we're fucking neighbors now.

416
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:55,840
I'm not here to fight with you
or trade insults.

417
00:24:55,874 --> 00:24:57,241
That's a good thing,

418
00:24:57,276 --> 00:25:00,545
'cause you probably wouldn't
last one round.

419
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:05,516
Uh, I came here to talk
to you about Dexter.

420
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:07,518
Dexter.

421
00:25:07,553 --> 00:25:09,520
If you care about him
as much as I do,

422
00:25:09,555 --> 00:25:11,122
you'll listen to what
I have to say.

423
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:13,090
Just hear me out.
That's all I ask.

424
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,226
I'm all ears.

425
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,728
Dexter is happy, and...

426
00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:19,530
I know him well enough
to understand

427
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:22,533
that this is
a pretty big deal.

428
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:24,535
He's been through
a lot of trouble

429
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,371
and a lot of pain.

430
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:30,241
I can't deny that.

431
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:32,810
I think for the first time
in a really long time,

432
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:36,848
he's actually looking forward
to the future.

433
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:39,550
He talks about it.

434
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:43,454
About me and him together.

435
00:25:45,257 --> 00:25:49,093
And I think that Dexter
could be a whole lot happier

436
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:53,130
if he knew that you and I
could find some common ground.

437
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:55,633
- For Dexter's sake.
- Yeah.

438
00:25:57,236 --> 00:25:59,203
Hmm.

439
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:07,845
He really does seem to like
having you around.

440
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,881
I love him.

441
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:11,983
And I know that you do too.

442
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:13,818
Yeah, you bet I do.

443
00:26:13,852 --> 00:26:16,120
Can't we work out
our issues?

444
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:23,060
I think we can.

445
00:26:29,034 --> 00:26:32,737
It's because I love Dexter

446
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:35,206
that I'm willing to do
whatever it takes

447
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,174
to protect him from you.

448
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:39,176
I'm not gonna give up

449
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:41,946
until your murdering ass
is behind bars for good.

450
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,049
That's how we're gonna
work out our issues.

451
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:48,185
But, hey...

452
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,323
Thanks for stopping by.

453
00:26:52,357 --> 00:26:53,791
Okay.

454
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:08,973
- Son of a bitch.
- You got a dead one.

455
00:27:10,742 --> 00:27:12,977
Yeah.

456
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:14,345
Well, it's gonna have
to stay dead.

457
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:16,614
There's only so much
a man can do.

458
00:27:16,648 --> 00:27:19,250
What brings you around?

459
00:27:19,284 --> 00:27:21,218
Merry Christmas.

460
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:23,955
I noticed you were on empty.

461
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:27,091
Thanks.

462
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,760
I was also thinking about
the last conversation we had.

463
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:31,529
I owe you an apology.

464
00:27:31,563 --> 00:27:35,066
I should have come forward
with my suspicion about Doakes.

465
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,368
More people would be alive.

466
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:38,903
No, if anyone
should apologize, it's me.

467
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:40,271
I was stupid.

468
00:27:40,305 --> 00:27:42,807
I should never have even
entertained Maria's crazy theory

469
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:45,109
about you being
the Bay Harbor Butcher.

470
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:47,511
You think she'll ever
accept the truth?

471
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:50,581
She already has.
We found Doakes's boathouse.

472
00:27:50,615 --> 00:27:52,149
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

473
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:53,551
What's even more amazing

474
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:55,886
is what we found
hidden inside it.

475
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:58,322
I won't go into details
except to say

476
00:27:58,357 --> 00:28:00,825
that it leaves no doubt
as to Doakes's guilt.

477
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:02,259
Believe me,

478
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:04,862
you won't have to worry
about LaGuerta anymore.

479
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:08,132
Well...

480
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,735
I gotta say that's
about the best Christmas present

481
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:13,371
I could have imagined.
You and me both.

482
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:14,972
Have a good Christmas
with your boy.

483
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:17,541
We will.

484
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:22,613
Christmas just got a lot less
merry for Hector Estrada.

485
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:25,716
My late-lamented dark passenger
would be very pleased.

486
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:28,953
If I can break this last strand
from my past,

487
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:31,088
do I get the future I want?

488
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:32,790
Yep.

489
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:34,558
I just went
to see Matthews again.

490
00:28:34,593 --> 00:28:37,161
They're calling off
the investigation.

491
00:28:37,195 --> 00:28:39,063
You sure?

492
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:41,899
Yeah. They bought it.
Everything.

493
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:44,735
Well, let's hope
they stay bought.

494
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,737
Thanks, Deb.

495
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:57,415
You Hector Estrada?

496
00:28:57,449 --> 00:28:59,650
- I know you?
- You do now.

497
00:28:59,684 --> 00:29:02,753
I'm Steve Gaskill.

498
00:29:02,788 --> 00:29:04,622
Come on, man.
You're a legend.

499
00:29:04,656 --> 00:29:06,157
You're gonna be a stain
on my shoe

500
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:08,426
if you don't crawl back
to where you came from.

501
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,294
Look, I know I'm probably
way outta line here,

502
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:12,430
but I really gotta tell you
about my situation.

503
00:29:12,464 --> 00:29:15,032
I have this contact in Honduras,
an old army buddy.

504
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:18,035
He sends me a crate of Sativa
every other month.

505
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,304
I've been trying
to lay it off where I can,

506
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:22,039
you know, college campuses
and whatnot,

507
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:23,607
but keeps piling up.

508
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:25,209
It's just too much
for me to move.

509
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:26,610
How much
are we talking about?

510
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:28,512
Enough to make you
shit your pants.

511
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:30,681
Anyway, I've been trying
to find a way

512
00:29:30,715 --> 00:29:32,249
into the Hispanic market.

513
00:29:32,284 --> 00:29:34,418
Here you are.
It's kismet.

514
00:29:34,453 --> 00:29:36,320
Kiss who?

515
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:39,190
It's, uh, good luck...
For both of us.

516
00:29:39,224 --> 00:29:41,358
I can show you the stuff.

517
00:29:41,393 --> 00:29:42,860
Let me know
if you're interested.

518
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:44,595
Maybe we can
work something out.

519
00:29:44,629 --> 00:29:46,897
First, let me hear you say
you're not a cop.

520
00:29:46,932 --> 00:29:48,799
I'm not a cop, man.

521
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:50,768
Jeez, we know a lot
of the same people--

522
00:29:50,802 --> 00:29:52,503
Tuerto, Pepe Chao.

523
00:29:52,537 --> 00:29:54,071
I've sold plenty
of shit to them.

524
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:55,806
Fuck!

525
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:58,609
Long time since I've dealt
with those guys.

526
00:30:02,247 --> 00:30:04,014
Where and when?

527
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:06,984
35 Quayside Road.
Tonight. 10:00.

528
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:10,821
Unless you got something else
to do on Christmas Eve.

529
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:12,656
I'll see you then.

530
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:19,597
- Yep.
- Dex, it's angel.

531
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:21,532
Debra's at St. Joseph's
in Hialeah.

532
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:22,900
She's been
in a car accident.

533
00:30:22,934 --> 00:30:25,503
I'll meet you
at the hospital.

534
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,614
Dex.

535
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:37,915
How is she?

536
00:30:37,949 --> 00:30:39,517
She's fine.

537
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:41,919
Her wrist is broken,
and there's lots of bruising,

538
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:43,621
but she'll be out
by tomorrow.

539
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:45,089
What happened?

540
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:47,725
Apparently, she blacked out
or something behind the wheel.

541
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:52,396
Does Debra have a prescription
for antianxiety medication?

542
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,064
I mean, not that there's
a problem.

543
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:56,767
Most people do.
Yeah, she does. Why?

544
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:59,537
The doctor said there was
a lot of that in her system,

545
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:02,339
almost three times
the normal dose.

546
00:31:02,374 --> 00:31:05,342
Now, maybe she lost track
on how much she took.

547
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:07,244
You know.
It happens.

548
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,214
Well, why is she here
in Hialeah?

549
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:11,682
Where was she going?

550
00:31:11,716 --> 00:31:13,851
Um...

551
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:16,020
Debra drove out here
for an interview,

552
00:31:16,054 --> 00:31:18,455
a second interview with a woman
named Arlene Shram.

553
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,992
Now, look, Dex, maybe I should
have told you this before now,

554
00:31:22,027 --> 00:31:23,928
but...

555
00:31:23,962 --> 00:31:25,563
Deb got a tip

556
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:28,098
that this woman,
Arlene Shram,

557
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:31,302
was a possible witness
to a murder...

558
00:31:31,336 --> 00:31:33,938
A murder committed
by Hannah McKay.

559
00:31:35,407 --> 00:31:36,941
Yes, you should have
told me.

560
00:31:36,975 --> 00:31:39,043
Debra has a bug up her ass
with this girl.

561
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:42,713
Maybe that's why she took
all those antianxiety pills.

562
00:31:42,747 --> 00:31:46,750
Because she's convinced that her
brother is dating a killer.

563
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:53,090
I don't know what happened.

564
00:31:53,124 --> 00:31:55,960
I was tired.
I was driving.

565
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:58,295
I kept getting sleepier
and sleepier,

566
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:01,632
and I don't know,
I must have...

567
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,133
Closed my eyes for a second?

568
00:32:03,168 --> 00:32:04,902
But the next thing I knew,
I was...

569
00:32:04,936 --> 00:32:07,605
Hanging upside down
in a ditch.

570
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:09,907
Hanging by my seatbelt.

571
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:15,212
This is the most fucked-est
Christmas ever.

572
00:32:15,247 --> 00:32:17,448
And were gonna spend it
with Arlene Shram.

573
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:21,485
Hannah told you.

574
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,421
Hannah knew?

575
00:32:24,456 --> 00:32:27,024
She was at my house
yesterday

576
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:30,227
asking me to back off.

577
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:32,630
Arlene must have called her
after I left her house--

578
00:32:32,664 --> 00:32:35,933
Hannah was at your house
yesterday?

579
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:37,968
Yes.

580
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:44,608
And now I'm here.

581
00:32:44,643 --> 00:32:47,011
Fucking hell, Dexter.

582
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:48,912
She didn't poison you.

583
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:52,182
Well, I sure as shit didn't
swallow a handful of pills.

584
00:32:52,217 --> 00:32:54,285
The doctor said
that it's possible

585
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:56,654
the drugs built up
in your system.

586
00:32:56,688 --> 00:33:00,658
I took one.

587
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:04,428
One. Last night.

588
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:07,798
That drug has a short
half-life.

589
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:12,036
Gotta hand it to her.
That's a really good plan.

590
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,005
Making it look like
I accidentally took

591
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,107
too much of a prescription
that I have?

592
00:33:17,142 --> 00:33:19,510
It's not a hard drug to get.

593
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:21,512
How would she even know
that you were on it?

594
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:24,982
- You must have mentioned it.
- I never did. No.

595
00:33:25,016 --> 00:33:26,650
That's the thing about people

596
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:30,154
that poison people, Dexter--
they're really fucking sneaky.

597
00:33:30,188 --> 00:33:32,556
So...

598
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,124
She, what, poisoned you

599
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,726
while she was at your house
last night?

600
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,028
I didn't let her inside
my house last night.

601
00:33:38,063 --> 00:33:39,663
- Deb--
- I went for a run.

602
00:33:39,698 --> 00:33:42,599
Maybe she broke in
after I left or something.

603
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:46,603
She broke into your house
and did what?

604
00:33:49,874 --> 00:33:51,575
I don't know how she did it.

605
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:53,377
- Because she didn't.
- Fuck.

606
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:55,312
This is exactly what happened
to Sal Price.

607
00:33:55,347 --> 00:33:57,648
As soon as he got close to
knowing the truth about Hannah,

608
00:33:57,682 --> 00:33:59,616
she killed him.
There's no proof

609
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:01,385
that she killed Sal Price,

610
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:03,654
and there's certainly no proof
that she poisoned you.

611
00:34:03,688 --> 00:34:06,357
Well, maybe we need
to find the proof.

612
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:15,165
I think there's another
explanation for what happened.

613
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,267
You took more of those pills

614
00:34:17,302 --> 00:34:18,635
than you think you did.

615
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,671
You've been under
a lot of stress, Deb.

616
00:34:20,705 --> 00:34:23,674
No shit, Sherlock.

617
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,177
So you took one
and you lost track.

618
00:34:27,212 --> 00:34:28,545
You took another.

619
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,514
And another--
it's possible.

620
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:32,516
It happens.

621
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,219
You have to admit that.
Right?

622
00:34:39,124 --> 00:34:40,958
Deb's more right
than she knows

623
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:42,993
about what happened
to Sal Price.

624
00:34:43,027 --> 00:34:46,397
But Hannah wouldn't
do that to Debra.

625
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:48,265
Would she?

626
00:34:54,472 --> 00:34:58,275
I make my living at crime
scenes, proving what happened.

627
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:04,348
But now can I prove
what didn't happen?

628
00:35:04,382 --> 00:35:07,217
Prove that Hannah
didn't poison Debra?

629
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:37,915
Is this proof
that Hannah was here?

630
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:43,620
Did she break in?

631
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:54,898
Or did she simply walk through
an open door?

632
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:58,936
Or did this fall off me?
Did I track this in just now?

633
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,404
The drug works quickly.

634
00:36:00,438 --> 00:36:04,308
Deb would have passed out
minutes after ingesting it.

635
00:36:06,444 --> 00:36:07,845
Sorry for your loss.

636
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:10,481
No. My sister's
doing fine.

637
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:14,818
Yeah. Can't say the same
thing for this poor baby.

638
00:36:14,853 --> 00:36:17,855
You'll have to go in
through the passenger side.

639
00:36:47,652 --> 00:36:49,152
I'll see what the lab
has to say

640
00:36:49,187 --> 00:36:51,655
about what's in this bottle.

641
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:55,158
Hannah didn't poison Debra.

642
00:36:55,193 --> 00:36:58,662
All I want for Christmas
is for that to be true.

643
00:37:03,835 --> 00:37:05,335
Merry Christmas Eve.

644
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,505
We're having a <i>noche buena</i>
at the restaurant later.

645
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,508
Auri will be there.
You should come by.

646
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:14,811
Uh, thank you but, uh...

647
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:16,680
I'm not up for it.

648
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:19,716
Holidays, family, cheer...

649
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:22,386
They're keeping Debra
overnight at the hospital.

650
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,820
I thought you
should know that.

651
00:37:23,855 --> 00:37:24,988
I know.

652
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:30,894
You wanna tell me
the real reason you're here?

653
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:36,733
I been thinking about
what's next for me

654
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:38,835
after all this.
Yeah?

655
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,371
I'm enjoying the restaurant,
even with all the headaches.

656
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:45,442
It's real.

657
00:37:45,476 --> 00:37:47,744
Straightforward.

658
00:37:47,779 --> 00:37:50,781
You open up,
you feed people,

659
00:37:50,815 --> 00:37:52,683
you clean up,

660
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:54,952
you close up,
and you go home.

661
00:37:54,986 --> 00:37:56,954
That's it.
That's your day.

662
00:37:56,988 --> 00:37:59,957
You don't carry it with you.

663
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:02,893
- Not like this job?
- No.

664
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:06,797
And up until,
I don't know...

665
00:38:06,831 --> 00:38:08,031
Mike's death maybe,

666
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:11,902
it never got to me.

667
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:15,372
It's time, isn't it?

668
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:19,242
You ever think about
what's next?

669
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:22,512
Sometimes.

670
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:25,816
I've been looking back
a little too, you know,

671
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:30,253
wondering about some
choices I've made...

672
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:32,255
Wishing I'd made
different ones.

673
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,325
Wha-are you, uh...
talking about me?

674
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,227
Are you talking about you,
about us?

675
00:38:37,261 --> 00:38:39,730
You--you--are you wishing
that it would have worked out?

676
00:38:39,764 --> 00:38:41,264
No.

677
00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:43,000
No.

678
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:45,435
Okay. Just checking.

679
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:49,606
So...when are you retiring?

680
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:52,109
Thought about putting
my papers in on the first.

681
00:38:55,747 --> 00:38:59,049
Happy New Year.

682
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,618
- Let's hope.
- Mm-hmm.

683
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:07,424
Dexter.
Hey.

684
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:09,826
I was worried about you.

685
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:15,532
Oh, look who's here!

686
00:39:15,566 --> 00:39:18,301
- Daddy's home.
- Come here, bud.

687
00:39:18,336 --> 00:39:21,872
Yeah.

688
00:39:21,906 --> 00:39:23,340
Thanks for staying over
tonight.

689
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:24,875
My pleasure.

690
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:27,110
Ever since
I've gone vegetarian,

691
00:39:27,145 --> 00:39:29,312
the idea of watching my brother
roast a whole pig

692
00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:31,682
grosses me out.

693
00:39:31,716 --> 00:39:34,184
Besides,
you guys are family too.

694
00:39:34,218 --> 00:39:36,453
Yeah. So are you.

695
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:39,556
- How's Debra?
- Yeah, how's she doing?

696
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,658
She's fine.
She should be out tomorrow.

697
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:43,827
I'm glad to hear that.

698
00:39:43,861 --> 00:39:46,663
Well, I hope you're hungry,
Dexter.

699
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:01,144
Look at her.
So beautiful.

700
00:40:11,355 --> 00:40:15,592
But can you ever fully trust
a poisoner?

701
00:40:19,697 --> 00:40:22,532
Mmm...

702
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:25,736
Okay, Dexter?

703
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,704
Dexter.

704
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:30,107
Earth to Dexter.

705
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:32,609
I think your food coma's
hitting way early.

706
00:40:32,643 --> 00:40:34,811
- I think you're right.
- What do you want?

707
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:37,781
Uh, a little bit
of everything.

708
00:40:39,217 --> 00:40:41,585
Christmas is a time
of expectation.

709
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,386
If you're good,
a red-suited fat man

710
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:46,223
will break into your house
and leave you presents.

711
00:40:46,257 --> 00:40:49,960
But Santa Claus doesn't exist.

712
00:40:49,994 --> 00:40:53,930
The most wonderful time
of the year celebrates a lie.

713
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,071
Is the future I imagine
with Hannah

714
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:04,541
nothing more than a vision
dancing in my head?

715
00:41:19,123 --> 00:41:22,926
It's funny how we started off
in Santa's holiday adventure

716
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,427
and here we are,

717
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:27,430
Christmas Eve together.

718
00:41:27,465 --> 00:41:30,233
A place I never thought
I'd be with anyone...again.

719
00:41:30,268 --> 00:41:32,569
Much less you.

720
00:41:35,473 --> 00:41:37,974
Thanks.

721
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:40,277
I'm not saying this
quite right.

722
00:41:40,311 --> 00:41:42,946
Um...

723
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,182
All the men
that I've been with--

724
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,018
there was a lot of...

725
00:41:48,052 --> 00:41:50,620
running away.

726
00:41:50,655 --> 00:41:53,490
But when I'm with you,

727
00:41:53,524 --> 00:41:55,926
I don't wanna go anywhere.

728
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:05,502
Stay with me tonight.

729
00:42:05,536 --> 00:42:09,439
No, I can't.
I have somewhere to be.

730
00:42:09,473 --> 00:42:11,975
Debra?

731
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:19,516
Estrada?

732
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,653
Good for you.

733
00:42:23,688 --> 00:42:26,489
I know he's somebody that you've
wanted for a long time.

734
00:42:26,524 --> 00:42:29,893
Someone I thought
I'd never get.

735
00:42:29,927 --> 00:42:33,830
I imagine that will be
deeply satisfying.

736
00:42:42,006 --> 00:42:44,374
When Deb had her accident...

737
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:47,878
She was heading
to Arlene Shram's house.

738
00:42:54,452 --> 00:42:55,886
She was hoping Arlene
would give her a statement

739
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,890
that would let her
arrest you.

740
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:03,760
But Deb never made it there.

741
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:06,663
She blacked out
behind the wheel.

742
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:14,337
Does that sound familiar?

743
00:43:14,372 --> 00:43:16,539
- Familiar?
- Sal Price.

744
00:43:16,574 --> 00:43:18,541
It's what you hoped
would happen to him

745
00:43:18,576 --> 00:43:20,677
before you poisoned him.

746
00:43:23,714 --> 00:43:28,218
Are you--

747
00:43:28,252 --> 00:43:30,020
do you think that I had
something to do

748
00:43:30,054 --> 00:43:34,057
with Debra's accident?

749
00:43:34,091 --> 00:43:35,525
Did you?

750
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:40,497
I can't believe you would
even think something like that.

751
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,135
Say something.
I know you will always do

752
00:43:45,169 --> 00:43:47,270
whatever it takes
to protect yourself.

753
00:43:47,305 --> 00:43:49,005
That does not include trying
to poison your sister.

754
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,573
You yourself told me
Arlene saw you

755
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:52,742
poison that counselor's
coffee.

756
00:43:52,777 --> 00:43:54,244
And I can't tell you
how many times

757
00:43:54,278 --> 00:43:56,346
I saw Arlene shoot up.

758
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,181
I was nervous about
what she could do to me,

759
00:43:58,215 --> 00:44:02,218
but then I went to see her
and...she's a mess

760
00:44:02,253 --> 00:44:04,220
that any second-year law student
could discredit.

761
00:44:04,255 --> 00:44:06,523
She's not a threat to me.

762
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,202
But Deb is.

763
00:44:19,236 --> 00:44:20,937
Do you really think
that I would be that stupid

764
00:44:20,972 --> 00:44:25,575
to try and poison
the lieutenant of homicide?

765
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:28,912
And to think that
you wouldn't figure it out?

766
00:44:28,946 --> 00:44:32,615
Wouldn't exactly bring us
closer together, would it?

767
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,656
You know I love you, right?

768
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,092
Yes.

769
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:45,395
Do you love me?

770
00:44:45,429 --> 00:44:48,732
Yes.

771
00:44:50,034 --> 00:44:52,936
I don't know
if I believe you.

772
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:56,439
You were at her house
last night.

773
00:44:56,474 --> 00:44:58,942
I thought that if she knew
how much I cared about you,

774
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:00,777
then she would
back down a little.

775
00:45:00,811 --> 00:45:04,681
But she never will.

776
00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:06,649
What happens next week
when Deb has a heart attack?

777
00:45:06,684 --> 00:45:08,084
Do you hear yourself?

778
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:10,420
If anything
ever happens to Deb,

779
00:45:10,454 --> 00:45:11,888
I'm gonna wonder if you had
something to do with it.

780
00:45:11,922 --> 00:45:14,357
Well, that's your problem--
your lack of trust.

781
00:45:14,392 --> 00:45:17,127
Your inability to trust.

782
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:19,863
God, it's like...
It's like you have something

783
00:45:19,897 --> 00:45:23,967
deep down inside of you that you
think is undeserving of love.

784
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:27,037
- Don't turn this back on me.
- You're the one accusing me.

785
00:45:27,071 --> 00:45:30,240
I ju-- I know what
you're capable of!

786
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,983
Okay, I'm not sure
quite how to say this, but...

787
00:45:43,254 --> 00:45:47,524
I've never made a mistake.

788
00:45:47,558 --> 00:45:50,760
If I had poisoned Debra,
then she would be dead,

789
00:45:50,795 --> 00:45:53,663
and if you know me the way
that you say that you do,

790
00:45:53,697 --> 00:45:55,965
then you know
that that's true.

791
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:03,440
Maybe it all was
just an accident.

792
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:07,811
I know it must have been
really scary

793
00:46:07,845 --> 00:46:09,946
to see her in the hospital
like that.

794
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,849
It was.

795
00:46:12,883 --> 00:46:15,318
And it's understandable
that you would try

796
00:46:15,352 --> 00:46:19,456
to make sense of a situation
that doesn't make sense,

797
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:23,226
but you're doing that at the
expense of this relationship.

798
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:26,029
I'm not trying to.
I--

799
00:46:26,063 --> 00:46:28,231
I don't want to lose you.

800
00:46:28,265 --> 00:46:31,267
I'm sure about you.

801
00:46:31,302 --> 00:46:33,937
I'm 100% sure,

802
00:46:33,971 --> 00:46:37,540
but you need to be able
to say the same thing about me.

803
00:46:37,575 --> 00:46:40,477
I know.

804
00:46:42,046 --> 00:46:45,181
We could have it all.

805
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,223
I think you need to figure out
what it is that you want.

806
00:46:53,257 --> 00:46:56,459
And what type of future
you want to have.

807
00:47:53,317 --> 00:47:55,318
It's right in here.

808
00:47:58,222 --> 00:48:00,156
What the fuck is this?
Huh?

809
00:48:00,191 --> 00:48:02,492
Where's the stuff?

810
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:17,373
Estrada!
Estrada.

811
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:22,278
Estrada, it's time.

812
00:48:24,515 --> 00:48:27,150
I guess the Department of
Corrections kept that for you.

813
00:48:27,184 --> 00:48:30,053
That was very thoughtful.

814
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:34,657
You've changed a lot
in the past 40 years.

815
00:48:34,692 --> 00:48:38,294
So have I.

816
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:40,897
Three men murdered my mother.

817
00:48:40,931 --> 00:48:44,534
Juan Pablo Aliso
was shot in another deal.

818
00:48:44,568 --> 00:48:46,436
Santos Jimenez.
You remember him.

819
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:50,206
He testified against you.

820
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:54,177
I cut him into six roughly equal
pieces with a chain saw...

821
00:48:54,211 --> 00:48:56,446
Just like he did my mother.

822
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,648
Just like I'm gonna
do to you.

823
00:48:58,682 --> 00:49:01,551
Holy fuck!
You're Dickie Moser!

824
00:49:01,585 --> 00:49:04,254
Dexter...Moser.

825
00:49:11,061 --> 00:49:13,896
I am Dexter Moser...

826
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:16,199
And I'm gonna kill you.

827
00:49:16,233 --> 00:49:18,067
Is that what all this
is about?

828
00:49:18,102 --> 00:49:22,205
I was three years old when you
left me in that container.

829
00:49:24,008 --> 00:49:27,043
Who am I gonna be
when you're dead?

830
00:49:27,077 --> 00:49:31,581
Still some fucking freak,
probably.

831
00:49:31,615 --> 00:49:33,583
We'll see.

832
00:49:40,924 --> 00:49:45,495
Ha. You're working
with her, aren't you?

833
00:49:45,529 --> 00:49:47,930
What?

834
00:49:47,965 --> 00:49:50,133
That fucking cop bitch,

835
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:52,035
the one who got me out.

836
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:54,604
Oh, yeah, they said
that there was a big push

837
00:49:54,638 --> 00:49:58,808
for my release
from the captain of Miami Metro.

838
00:49:58,842 --> 00:50:01,511
LaGuerta?

839
00:50:01,545 --> 00:50:04,013
She fucking set me up.

840
00:50:04,048 --> 00:50:07,283
You're not the one
who was set up.

841
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:09,352
Officer.

842
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:10,987
We followed him to here,
but we lost him.

843
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:12,488
Until we heard the gunshot.

844
00:50:12,523 --> 00:50:14,657
That's when we called you.

845
00:50:14,692 --> 00:50:16,159
All right.
Anything else since?

846
00:50:16,193 --> 00:50:18,161
- No, ma'am.
- Show me where.

847
00:50:44,788 --> 00:50:47,457
What the fuck
is going on in this place?

848
00:50:47,491 --> 00:50:49,625
Keep looking for Estrada
and anyone else with him.

849
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,661
Estrada's not alone.

850
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:04,807
Don't make a fucking sound.

851
00:51:14,084 --> 00:51:16,486
Around this side.

852
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,187
Around the back.
Which side?

853
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:33,102
It wasn't the universe
giving me a gift.

854
00:51:33,137 --> 00:51:35,371
It was LaGuerta.

855
00:51:55,426 --> 00:51:57,927
I can make sure at least
one member of the Morgan family

856
00:51:57,961 --> 00:52:00,196
has a good Christmas.

857
00:52:08,238 --> 00:52:11,007
Yes.
Dexter, it's Sergio.

858
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:13,109
You told me to call you when
I ran that water you brought in.

859
00:52:13,143 --> 00:52:15,778
I know it's early.
It's okay. What'd you find?

860
00:52:15,813 --> 00:52:17,680
That water's like
40% Alprazolam.

861
00:52:17,714 --> 00:52:19,849
That's an antianxiety drug.

862
00:52:19,883 --> 00:52:22,318
Someone must have really wanted
to knock themselves out.

863
00:52:22,352 --> 00:52:26,255
But this time of year,
who can blame 'em?

864
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:28,357
- Thanks.
- You got it.

865
00:52:30,894 --> 00:52:32,795
It was no accident.

866
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,131
Hannah dissolved the pills
into Deb's water

867
00:52:35,165 --> 00:52:38,434
so that she'd pass out
behind the wheel.

868
00:52:38,469 --> 00:52:42,839
A problem
in Hannah's life solved.

869
00:52:42,873 --> 00:52:46,309
Hannah poisoned Debra.

870
00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:49,912
It's not the future
I had wanted with Hannah...

871
00:52:49,947 --> 00:52:52,815
but maybe it's what I deserve.

872
00:53:05,128 --> 00:53:09,031
You barely said two words
on the ride home.

873
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:17,406
I have something for you.

874
00:53:17,441 --> 00:53:19,575
A present?

875
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:22,144
A new car, I hope.

876
00:53:24,114 --> 00:53:26,415
I guess it's a present.

877
00:53:28,151 --> 00:53:32,455
It's Sal Price's pen.

878
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:33,856
If you test it,

879
00:53:33,891 --> 00:53:37,126
you'll find traces
of aconite on the end...

880
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,862
and Hannah's prints.

881
00:53:42,432 --> 00:53:44,400
So that's how she did it.

882
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:55,411
I found it the next morning.
I kept it out of evidence.

883
00:53:57,748 --> 00:54:00,616
I can't believe
you're gonna turn her in.

884
00:54:04,187 --> 00:54:07,056
As long as she's free,
you're not safe.

885
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,362
Dex, I know how hard
this must be for you.

886
00:54:31,982 --> 00:54:34,450
You're here.

887
00:54:38,755 --> 00:54:41,791
Does that mean
that you know what you want?

888
00:54:41,825 --> 00:54:44,760
Yes.

889
00:54:48,198 --> 00:54:50,399
Hannah...

890
00:54:50,434 --> 00:54:52,768
You have to kiss me,
or it's bad luck.

891
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:08,951
What's the matter?

892
00:55:08,986 --> 00:55:10,987
I'm sorry.

893
00:55:11,021 --> 00:55:14,123
You're sorry--

894
00:55:21,131 --> 00:55:23,165
Hannah McKay,
you're under arrest

895
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,801
for the murder of Sal Price.

896
00:55:36,713 --> 00:55:39,015
You should have killed me.

897
00:55:57,367 --> 00:56:00,836
I should know better
than to count on the future.

898
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:12,214
All you can ever believe in
is now...

899
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:15,017
This moment.

900
00:56:18,321 --> 00:56:22,525
Because in a blink...
Everything can change.

901
00:56:23,275 --> 00:56:28,275
