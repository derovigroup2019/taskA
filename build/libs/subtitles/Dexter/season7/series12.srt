00:00:20,183 --> 00:01:43,323
?

5
00:01:46,094 --> 00:01:48,195
Previously on <i>Dexter.</i>

6
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:51,832
Dexter, what the fuck?

7
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:54,068
Maybe we should
just get rid of the body.

8
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:56,370
We can make it
look like a suicide.

9
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:57,905
How do we do that?

10
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,040
Gasoline.

11
00:01:59,074 --> 00:02:00,107
There's a station nearby.

12
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:03,144
I'll go get
a couple gallons.

13
00:02:07,723 --> 00:02:10,324
If Doakes really wasn't
the Bay Harbor Butcher,

14
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:12,994
the best thing to do
is to look into his final days.

15
00:02:13,028 --> 00:02:15,263
We should start
with the cabin in the Everglades

16
00:02:15,297 --> 00:02:18,466
where Doakes died.

17
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,402
Maria's convinced
that Doakes was innocent

18
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:23,271
and that the real killer
might be you.

19
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:27,041
Me?

20
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:30,044
Do what you gotta do.

21
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:35,083
That was the Department
of Corrections.

22
00:02:35,117 --> 00:02:38,820
Hector Estrada is up for parole.
Estrada?

23
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:40,488
Remember I told you about
my mother and how she died?

24
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:45,727
Was he one of the men
that killed her?

25
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:47,695
He was the leader.
He gave the order.

26
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,498
Maybe it's the universe
giving you a Christmas present.

27
00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:53,201
No one but you
would see it that way.

28
00:02:53,235 --> 00:02:54,736
Estrada!

29
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,038
You're working with her,
aren't you?

30
00:02:57,072 --> 00:02:59,407
That fucking cop bitch.

31
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:00,708
The one that got me out.

32
00:03:00,743 --> 00:03:01,709
LaGuerta?

33
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:02,910
She fucking set me up.

34
00:03:02,945 --> 00:03:04,879
You're not the one
who was set up.

35
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:14,455
Debra's at St. Joseph's
in Hialeah.

36
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,656
She's been
in a car accident.

37
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:17,091
Well, I sure as shit
didn't swallow

38
00:03:17,126 --> 00:03:18,593
a handful of pills.

39
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:20,762
She what,
poisoned you

40
00:03:20,796 --> 00:03:21,963
while she was
at your house last night?

41
00:03:21,997 --> 00:03:23,297
We need to find the proof.

42
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:26,000
Hannah dissolved
the pills into Deb's water

43
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:28,369
so that she'd pass out
behind the wheel.

44
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:30,805
Sal price's pen.

45
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:34,609
If you test it, you'll find
traces of aconite on the end.

46
00:03:34,643 --> 00:03:36,477
I can't believe
you're gonna turn her in.

47
00:03:36,512 --> 00:03:39,046
As long as she's free,
you're not safe.

48
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:42,049
You should have killed me.

49
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,834
You look like
you got some sun.

50
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:37,371
The boat.

51
00:04:37,405 --> 00:04:39,373
They treating you well?

52
00:04:39,407 --> 00:04:43,110
I get
ten minutes outside.

53
00:04:43,144 --> 00:04:45,212
My cellmate seems nice.

54
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:47,514
She robbed a liquor store
so she could buy some meth.

55
00:04:47,549 --> 00:04:48,549
Look, you have
every right to--

56
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,718
- You said that you loved me.
- I do.

57
00:04:50,752 --> 00:04:54,722
- Then why am I here?
- You poisoned Debra.

58
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:03,731
Because she was
trying to keep us apart.

59
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:09,002
And what
was I supposed to do?

60
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:12,072
I don't know.

61
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:13,907
But I know you could have
just broken up with me.

62
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:17,745
And completely free you up
to kill Deb? No.

63
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:21,448
I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life behind bars.

64
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:24,451
- You left me no choice.
- You had a choice.

65
00:05:24,486 --> 00:05:26,387
You were supposed
to choose me.

66
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:31,592
- She's my sister.
- Oh, Jesus.

67
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:34,561
I never stood a chance.

68
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:42,102
Don't.

69
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:50,677
Why are you even here?

70
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:54,448
I had to see you.

71
00:05:54,482 --> 00:05:57,384
If you're worried I'm gonna
tell people what you are,

72
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,219
then don't worry.

73
00:05:59,254 --> 00:06:02,923
Your secret is safe with me.

74
00:06:02,957 --> 00:06:04,425
Is it?

75
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:08,429
I would never
do that to you.

76
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:13,667
I came here
because I wanted--

77
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:18,305
I needed you to know...

78
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:19,440
If there was another--

79
00:06:19,474 --> 00:06:24,678
any way
to keep Deb safe,

80
00:06:24,712 --> 00:06:27,681
I would have found it.

81
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:39,493
I miss you so much.

82
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:42,496
I miss you too.

83
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:49,636
You're the only person
in the world

84
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:52,639
I don't have to hide
anything from.

85
00:06:55,844 --> 00:06:59,847
I don't know
what I'm gonna do without you.

86
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:02,850
Dexter,
it's not too late.

87
00:07:05,787 --> 00:07:09,089
The only thing they have on me
is that fucking pen.

88
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:12,226
If the pen disappears,
so can we.

89
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,095
We can go some place
that your sister can't find us.

90
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:19,032
We can go to Argentina
and be together always.

91
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:21,902
I can never trust you.

92
00:07:21,936 --> 00:07:23,604
But, you just--

93
00:07:23,638 --> 00:07:27,641
And you know
you can never trust me.

94
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:33,947
We both knew
it would come to this.

95
00:07:33,982 --> 00:07:37,117
One of us dead
or behind bars.

96
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:39,586
Yeah.

97
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:43,590
Except I always thought
it would be you.

98
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,826
Sorry.

99
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,829
Yeah, me too.

100
00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:18,258
Goodbye, Dexter.

101
00:08:34,642 --> 00:08:37,110
I tried to kill Hannah,
but couldn't.

102
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:42,783
I wanna hate her for what she
did to Deb, but can't.

103
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:44,284
Hello?

104
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:46,653
An inmate from the Miami-Dade
Sheriff's Department

105
00:08:46,688 --> 00:08:49,189
is trying to contact you
via collect call.

106
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:50,424
Do you accept the charges?

107
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,793
- Uh, yeah.
- Connecting.

108
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:54,962
Arlene, thank God.

109
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:56,363
Hannah, what is it?
What's wrong?

110
00:08:56,397 --> 00:08:58,865
I can't do this.
I can't spend my life in here.

111
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,203
I need you to help me.
I need this to be over.

112
00:09:03,237 --> 00:09:04,705
No, you're stronger
than that.

113
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:06,139
You haven't even
had your trial.

114
00:09:06,174 --> 00:09:07,574
I--I can come visit you.

115
00:09:07,609 --> 00:09:09,276
Arlene, you owe me.

116
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,411
I took care of the counselor
for the both of us.

117
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:12,679
And now I need
your help, okay?

118
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:15,649
I can't live like this.

119
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:23,023
Tell me what to do.

120
00:09:23,057 --> 00:09:27,561
I don't know who's worse,
you or him.

121
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:30,097
It is toy-mageddon
every time I walk in here.

122
00:09:30,131 --> 00:09:33,667
He can't make up his mind
which one he likes the best.

123
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:36,837
He's a boy.
He wants them all.

124
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:38,438
I can clean this stuff up.

125
00:09:38,473 --> 00:09:39,873
Go, get ready for work.

126
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:42,042
I got it.

127
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:43,644
All right, Harrison.

128
00:09:43,678 --> 00:09:46,647
We're gonna need to let Jamie
pick some things up,

129
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:49,249
but that doesn't mean
you can't play with Thomas.

130
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:52,052
I want Hannah.

131
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:56,523
Sweetie, uh,
Hannah had to go away,

132
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:58,325
but that doesn't mean
that she doesn't miss you

133
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:01,261
very, very much. Okay?

134
00:10:03,831 --> 00:10:06,500
Here, let's see if we can
get Thomas to talk.

135
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,604
Captain?

136
00:10:10,638 --> 00:10:11,805
Dexter.

137
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,808
What are you doing here?

138
00:10:17,111 --> 00:10:20,747
It might be best if you take
Harrison to another room.

139
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:24,918
Because?

140
00:10:24,952 --> 00:10:26,687
Because I'm placing you
under arrest

141
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:29,556
for the murder
of Hector Estrada.

142
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,626
Dexter?

143
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,594
Maria, this has to be
some sort of mistake.

144
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:36,863
- I wish it was.
- Who the hell's Hector Estrada?

145
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:37,998
I need you to stay back.

146
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:39,866
- You get your hands off of me.
- Stay back.

147
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:41,635
Jamie, just take Harrison
to his room.

148
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:42,803
Please.
It's okay.

149
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:45,839
I'm calling Deb.

150
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,413
Dexter Morgan.

151
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:56,783
You have the right
to remain silent.

152
00:10:56,818 --> 00:10:59,252
Anything you say or do

153
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:01,088
can be used against you
in a court of law.

154
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:03,190
You have the right
to an attorney.

155
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:04,825
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

156
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:08,095
one will be
provided for you.

157
00:11:15,403 --> 00:11:17,604
What the hell's going on?

158
00:11:17,638 --> 00:11:20,674
Jesus.
LaGuerta arrested Morgan.

159
00:11:23,144 --> 00:11:24,878
Maria, what are you doing?

160
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:26,379
Out of my way, Angel.

161
00:11:26,414 --> 00:11:27,814
Why is Dexter in handcuffs?

162
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:30,450
I have proof
he's the Bay Harbor Butcher.

163
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:32,452
Doakes
is the Bay Harbor Butcher.

164
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:33,553
Have you lost your mind?

165
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:34,688
Dexter, what is this?

166
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:37,290
- I don't know.
- What the fuck?

167
00:11:37,325 --> 00:11:39,493
She thinks that your brother's
the Bay Harbor Butcher.

168
00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:42,462
How is that even possible?
It's not.

169
00:11:42,497 --> 00:11:44,664
Williams, take those things off
his fucking wrists right now.

170
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:47,234
- Leave those.
- Maria, what are you doing?

171
00:11:47,268 --> 00:11:49,369
Stand down, Lieutenant.

172
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:51,404
Dexter's my prisoner.
You're family.

173
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,306
You need to recuse yourself.

174
00:11:53,341 --> 00:11:55,976
Let's go.

175
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,012
- Angel.
- I'm on it.

176
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:09,256
Just so we're clear then...

177
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,260
Your official statement is that
you went fishing last night

178
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:15,562
and then went straight home
to be with your son.

179
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,798
I didn't kill
Hector Estrada.

180
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:20,634
No.

181
00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:22,836
You didn't cut his body
into pieces

182
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,839
and put it into bags,
take it on your boat,

183
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:27,440
and then throw it
into the ocean?

184
00:12:27,475 --> 00:12:29,109
Why would I do that?

185
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:30,944
Because Hector Estrada
butchered your mother

186
00:12:30,978 --> 00:12:32,579
in front of you.

187
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:36,116
So how about you start
telling me the truth?

188
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,352
I'm not
the Bay Harbor Butcher.

189
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:41,388
He's answered
all of your questions.

190
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:46,393
You've got nothing here, Maria.
Not all my questions.

191
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:50,664
These are from
my phone last night.

192
00:12:50,698 --> 00:12:54,434
And that's you carrying plastic
garbage bags onto your boat.

193
00:12:54,468 --> 00:12:57,137
It was ice to keep
any fish I caught cold.

194
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:59,973
My cooler broke.

195
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:02,642
But earlier today you said
you didn't catch anything.

196
00:13:02,677 --> 00:13:06,680
What was in the bag?

197
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:10,283
It was a shirt with
Hector Estrada's blood on it,

198
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:12,185
and his wallet.

199
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,920
You killed him.

200
00:13:13,955 --> 00:13:16,857
You killed him like you killed
all your other victims.

201
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:20,994
Admit it--
you're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

202
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:21,995
Dexter, don't say
another word.

203
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:24,197
That's enough, Sergeant.

204
00:13:24,232 --> 00:13:26,333
I was throwing away
my dinner.

205
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:29,536
It was a bag from Franco's.
You can check.

206
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,871
Angel, you gotta believe me.

207
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:33,139
You framed Doakes.

208
00:13:33,174 --> 00:13:37,010
After I defended you
against him.

209
00:13:37,044 --> 00:13:39,980
You betrayed me,
this department,

210
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:41,414
everybody around you.

211
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:42,816
Is that
what this is about?

212
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,853
Your desperate need to believe
the James Doakes you knew,

213
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:49,856
or thought you knew,
wasn't a cold-blooded killer?

214
00:13:49,891 --> 00:13:52,893
You don't have the right
to speak his name.

215
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:56,529
You're so hurt.

216
00:13:56,564 --> 00:13:59,165
Angry, scared.

217
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,902
He's dead because of you.

218
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:03,904
You were his partner.

219
00:14:03,938 --> 00:14:06,506
And his Lieutenant...

220
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,376
his lover.

221
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,112
What if you couldn't see what
was right in front of your eyes?

222
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:14,281
What does
that say about you?

223
00:14:14,315 --> 00:14:19,619
I swear to God, Dexter,
I'm gonna nail you to the wall

224
00:14:19,654 --> 00:14:20,620
for what you've done.

225
00:14:20,655 --> 00:14:22,289
- Maria.
- To the wall!

226
00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:23,857
Maria, that's enough.

227
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:27,060
God damn it, Lieutenant.
You can't be in here.

228
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:28,295
Tell them
what you just told me.

229
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:30,196
I reran the blood
on the shirt

230
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:32,365
that Captain LaGuerta
discovered in the trash.

231
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,768
It's definitely
Hector Estrada's,

232
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:38,204
but after going over it,
I found an evidence number.

233
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:40,907
What
what evidence number?

234
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:42,275
The shirt you gave me
with Estrada's blood on it

235
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,644
is the shirt he was wearing
the day he was brought in,

236
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,212
back in '73.

237
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:47,914
Things got a little rough,

238
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:50,450
and the arresting officers
broke his nose.

239
00:14:50,484 --> 00:14:52,719
That's impossible.

240
00:14:52,753 --> 00:14:54,487
I checked inventory.

241
00:14:54,522 --> 00:14:56,723
The shirt's missing.

242
00:14:56,757 --> 00:14:58,391
What about his wallet?

243
00:14:58,426 --> 00:14:59,726
Please don't
kill the messenger.

244
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,828
There was a partial print.

245
00:15:01,862 --> 00:15:04,130
And it's yours.

246
00:15:04,165 --> 00:15:05,265
Were you trying
to frame my brother?

247
00:15:05,299 --> 00:15:06,800
Deb.

248
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:09,069
You son of a bitch.
You set me up.

249
00:15:09,103 --> 00:15:10,236
Maria.

250
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:12,839
- Can I go now?
- Yes, you can.

251
00:15:12,873 --> 00:15:15,608
He did this!

252
00:15:15,643 --> 00:15:17,811
He's the Bay Harbor Butcher!
He has to be.

253
00:15:17,845 --> 00:15:19,646
This witch hunt of yours
is fucking over.

254
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,648
And if you have a problem
with it, Captain,

255
00:15:21,682 --> 00:15:24,684
we can take it upstairs.

256
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:36,763
Captain.

257
00:15:36,797 --> 00:15:38,531
Everyone else
may have bought

258
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:41,034
your little victim routine
in there,

259
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:43,269
but we both know the truth.

260
00:15:43,304 --> 00:15:47,007
And the truth is
it's been a very long day.

261
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:50,477
You set me up,
just like you did James.

262
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:54,614
And I'm sure you've already
managed to kill Estrada,

263
00:15:54,648 --> 00:15:56,850
which leaves me no chance
to prove any of this.

264
00:15:56,884 --> 00:15:58,685
Congratulations.

265
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,853
You've won again.

266
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:04,324
I just wanna go home
and see my son.

267
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:08,294
James always knew there was
something wrong with you.

268
00:16:10,197 --> 00:16:12,999
Surprise, motherfucker.

269
00:16:13,034 --> 00:16:15,702
You got my reports?
Hot off the presses.

270
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:18,171
Headlines.

271
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:20,840
26 stab wounds.
The first pierced her heart.

272
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,977
Whoever did this--
was making a fucking point.

273
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:27,447
This is our third vic.
Any suspects?

274
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:30,316
Walter Munro.
Fucker's crazy.

275
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:31,985
Thinks he's some kind
of philosopher or some shit.

276
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:34,487
Always scribbling his fucked up
thoughts in his journals.

277
00:16:34,522 --> 00:16:36,456
Hmm, the victims
are all prostitutes.

278
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,158
The wounds suggest
the same weapon.

279
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:39,926
It is consistent
with a single killer.

280
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,562
The thing is, he's crazy,
but he's smart too.

281
00:16:42,596 --> 00:16:45,598
I can never get
anything on him.

282
00:16:48,736 --> 00:16:52,439
Hold up.

283
00:16:55,543 --> 00:16:57,410
Sup?

284
00:16:57,445 --> 00:17:02,582
What we...talked about.

285
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:04,851
Come on, Maria.

286
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:06,086
Don't you at least
wanna think about it?

287
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,056
I'm sorry, James.

288
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:15,128
Oh, shit, Morgan.

289
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:17,697
I didn't even know
you were there.

290
00:17:17,731 --> 00:17:20,700
You're, like, invisible.

291
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:26,940
If only I had
stayed invisible.

292
00:17:26,974 --> 00:17:29,676
Maria, wait up.

293
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,678
Angel.

294
00:17:31,712 --> 00:17:33,079
- Hey.
- I-I don't wanna hear it.

295
00:17:33,114 --> 00:17:36,182
I just checked with
Estrada's parole officer.

296
00:17:36,217 --> 00:17:38,918
You were behind
his release from prison?

297
00:17:38,953 --> 00:17:42,689
Somehow, Dexter figured out
I was watching him.

298
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:50,096
Everyone thinks that you're
trying to frame Dexter.

299
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:51,331
- I--
- Dexter.

300
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:52,699
I don't care
what everybody else thinks.

301
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,634
Well, you better
start caring.

302
00:17:54,668 --> 00:17:55,969
Do you want
to keep your job?

303
00:17:56,003 --> 00:17:58,238
Of course
I want to keep my job.

304
00:17:58,272 --> 00:17:59,272
Well then,
you better back off

305
00:17:59,306 --> 00:18:00,940
and drop this
whole crazy idea.

306
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:04,410
Angel, I--I need you
to be on my side.

307
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:07,580
I am on your side and
that's why I'm telling you this.

308
00:18:07,615 --> 00:18:10,550
But you have to stop.

309
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:20,660
Okay, it looks pretty bad,
doesn't it?

310
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:21,761
More than pretty bad.

311
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:23,163
And you're gonna
have to work

312
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:24,631
really hard to fix this.

313
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:26,933
But come on, Maria.

314
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:32,438
If anyone can work their way out
of a jam like this, it's you.

315
00:18:35,943 --> 00:18:40,980
Thanks for your
advice, Angel.

316
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:45,852
We need to talk.

317
00:18:45,886 --> 00:18:50,323
Harrison just went to sleep.

318
00:18:50,357 --> 00:18:53,293
I'm glad one of us
will sleep tonight.

319
00:18:56,397 --> 00:18:57,897
How about a heads up
the next time

320
00:18:57,932 --> 00:18:59,399
you're gonna
get yourself arrested?

321
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:01,801
Or make our Captain
look like a fucking lunatic.

322
00:19:01,835 --> 00:19:03,536
It worked, didn't it?

323
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:05,772
Everyone thinks
LaGuerta framed me.

324
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:07,874
She won't be able
to come after me anymore.

325
00:19:07,908 --> 00:19:10,143
And all it cost her
was her career.

326
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:13,279
How many careers
has LaGuerta destroyed?

327
00:19:13,314 --> 00:19:15,448
It still doesn't
make it right.

328
00:19:15,482 --> 00:19:19,419
Not that I even know
what that is anymore.

329
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,461
I wish it hadn't come to this,
but it was either her or me.

330
00:19:28,495 --> 00:19:30,163
She almost caught me
trying to kill Estrada

331
00:19:30,197 --> 00:19:31,864
in that shipping container
on the docks.

332
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:34,300
Whose fault was that?

333
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:35,835
LaGuerta's the one
who set me up.

334
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:37,604
So you repay the favor?

335
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:41,341
Would you prefer my normal
method of conflict resolution?

336
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,875
Not fucking funny.

337
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,744
Look, there is a problem
and I solved it

338
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:48,081
the best way I knew how.
And it's over.

339
00:19:48,115 --> 00:19:49,449
That's what you keep saying.

340
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:51,417
But what about Hannah?

341
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:53,486
What about her?

342
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,756
Well, I assume she knows
what you are.

343
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,957
Yeah, but--

344
00:19:57,992 --> 00:19:59,492
Well,
her arraignment's tomorrow.

345
00:19:59,526 --> 00:20:00,760
How do you know
she won't use that

346
00:20:00,794 --> 00:20:02,528
as a bargaining chip
to get a better deal?

347
00:20:02,563 --> 00:20:05,198
- She won't.
- How do you know that.

348
00:20:05,232 --> 00:20:09,435
'Cause she's
in love with me.

349
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:13,473
Pray to fuck
you're right.

350
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:19,912
Take tomorrow off,
all right?

351
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:23,916
At least until the dust settles
with this LaGuerta thing.

352
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:33,593
You know this isn't over.

353
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:36,896
Despite what LaGuerta thinks,
Estrada's still out there.

354
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,097
Yeah, I know.

355
00:20:38,132 --> 00:20:39,732
It's been six days
since I let him go.

356
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:41,301
I haven't found him yet.

357
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:43,836
If he resurfaces
and LaGuerta gets wind of it--

358
00:20:43,871 --> 00:20:45,171
She'll offer him a deal.

359
00:20:45,205 --> 00:20:47,106
Put him up
in some safe house.

360
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:49,042
And you're left
having to explain to the D.A.

361
00:20:49,076 --> 00:20:50,643
Why you came after him
with a chainsaw.

362
00:20:50,678 --> 00:20:53,846
I'll find him.

363
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:57,183
I'll do what I have to do.

364
00:20:57,217 --> 00:21:00,153
You sound like Hannah.

365
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:12,765
According to
Estrada's parole officer

366
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,034
this is the last known
address of his wife.

367
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:17,170
Hector has
nowhere else to turn.

368
00:21:17,204 --> 00:21:20,139
He's wanted
by the police, me...

369
00:21:26,146 --> 00:21:31,718
Mrs. Estrada, I'm Arthur Curry,
Hector's parole officer.

370
00:21:31,752 --> 00:21:32,852
Why are you here?

371
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:34,587
I haven't seen
Hector in years.

372
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:37,490
- Hey, honey, who's that?
- The neighbor.

373
00:21:37,524 --> 00:21:41,127
Please, don't come here again.

374
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:43,162
My Tony doesn't like it.

375
00:21:43,197 --> 00:21:44,764
Well, if you haven't
seen Hector,

376
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:47,800
why are you
still married to him?

377
00:21:47,835 --> 00:21:49,702
I'm Catholic.

378
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:52,238
Is it that guy again?

379
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:53,740
You sure
he hasn't been around?

380
00:21:53,774 --> 00:21:56,709
You should go.

381
00:22:04,852 --> 00:22:06,552
It's been 40 years,

382
00:22:06,587 --> 00:22:09,155
but Florencia
hasn't let go of Hector.

383
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:13,593
Sometimes it only take a moment
to reveal who we really are.

384
00:22:13,627 --> 00:22:15,561
Looks like you spun
a goddamn web.

385
00:22:15,596 --> 00:22:17,663
It's more like a puzzle.

386
00:22:17,698 --> 00:22:18,798
So connect the dots.

387
00:22:18,832 --> 00:22:20,666
Can you pin this
on Munro or not?

388
00:22:20,701 --> 00:22:22,268
The entry wounds
on the victim

389
00:22:22,302 --> 00:22:25,171
are consistent with the puncture
wounds on the previous victims.

390
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:27,807
Uh, she was standing
when she was attacked.

391
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:31,077
She stumbled,
her body turning.

392
00:22:31,111 --> 00:22:33,012
And the killer's
behind her now,

393
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:36,416
stabbing her
in the back repeatedly.

394
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,051
And then she's
down on all fours,

395
00:22:39,086 --> 00:22:43,022
crawling away until the killer
grabs her and flips her over.

396
00:22:43,056 --> 00:22:44,524
He's on top of her now.

397
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,027
He slices
her carotid artery.

398
00:22:48,061 --> 00:22:50,797
She's terrified.
Heart's racing.

399
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:52,665
It's releasing more blood

400
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:57,870
in thick arterial spurts
here and here and here.

401
00:22:59,807 --> 00:23:01,107
I've never seen someone
so excited

402
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:02,975
about a crime scene before.

403
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,944
You like this blood shit
a little too much.

404
00:23:04,978 --> 00:23:06,446
I'm just doing my job.

405
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,848
Then wipe that fucking smile
off your face

406
00:23:08,882 --> 00:23:13,352
and help me
find the creep who did this.

407
00:23:13,387 --> 00:23:15,721
I let my guard down.

408
00:23:15,756 --> 00:23:18,591
For an instant, my real life
bled into my fake life,

409
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:22,829
and Doakes caught his
first glimpse of the real me.

410
00:23:51,158 --> 00:23:53,459
Thanks for coming, Tom.

411
00:23:53,494 --> 00:23:54,760
Christ sakes, Maria.

412
00:23:54,795 --> 00:23:56,362
It's all over the station.

413
00:23:56,396 --> 00:23:57,463
You tried to frame Dexter.

414
00:23:57,498 --> 00:23:59,699
You know
that's not true.

415
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:02,935
Do I?

416
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,238
The commissioner's going
to open an investigation

417
00:24:05,272 --> 00:24:07,373
into your recent conduct.

418
00:24:07,407 --> 00:24:10,042
If called to testify
I'll be dragged into this mess

419
00:24:10,077 --> 00:24:12,111
and have no choice
but to tell the truth--

420
00:24:12,145 --> 00:24:14,313
that we found definitive proof
in that boathouse

421
00:24:14,348 --> 00:24:16,115
that Doakes was
the Bay Harbor Butcher,

422
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:19,218
and that despite me advising
you to cease and desist,

423
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:22,054
you continued
on this reckless course.

424
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:24,056
So what's your advice?

425
00:24:24,091 --> 00:24:25,791
Get on your knees
and start kissing anything

426
00:24:25,826 --> 00:24:27,693
that even remotely
resembles an ass.

427
00:24:27,728 --> 00:24:30,296
I'm serious, Tom.

428
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,732
I was hoping
for your support.

429
00:24:32,766 --> 00:24:35,334
And make myself
look as crazy as you?

430
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:39,305
People still
respect you here.

431
00:24:41,642 --> 00:24:44,277
I need someone
to have my back, Tom.

432
00:24:44,311 --> 00:24:47,380
And you could say
I had reasonable suspicion.

433
00:24:47,414 --> 00:24:48,381
You carried it too far.

434
00:24:48,415 --> 00:24:49,448
Well, then say that.

435
00:24:49,483 --> 00:24:51,884
Say that due to my
overzealous nature

436
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,754
as a police officer, I got
too caught up in the case.

437
00:24:54,788 --> 00:24:56,689
You got too caught up
being an idiot.

438
00:24:56,723 --> 00:24:59,559
I'm already down, Tom.

439
00:24:59,593 --> 00:25:02,595
Stop kicking.

440
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:11,203
My job is at stake.

441
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:15,942
Tom.

442
00:25:15,976 --> 00:25:18,678
All right.

443
00:25:18,712 --> 00:25:19,879
I'll see what I can do.

444
00:25:19,913 --> 00:25:22,582
Thank you.

445
00:25:22,616 --> 00:25:27,353
You just keep
your head low.

446
00:25:27,387 --> 00:25:29,288
And for God's sake,
start doing your job

447
00:25:29,323 --> 00:25:32,325
if you have any hope
of keeping it.

448
00:25:44,271 --> 00:25:47,740
Lieutenant.
What brings you here?

449
00:25:47,774 --> 00:25:50,977
I'm the arresting officer.

450
00:25:51,011 --> 00:25:52,812
How's the wrist?

451
00:25:52,846 --> 00:25:55,081
Stronger every day.

452
00:25:55,115 --> 00:25:57,717
How's facing life without
the possibility of parole?

453
00:25:57,751 --> 00:26:01,921
Last time I checked it's
innocent until proven guilty.

454
00:26:01,955 --> 00:26:03,422
Well, this is
your last chance.

455
00:26:03,457 --> 00:26:05,024
You can save yourself
a lot of time and trouble

456
00:26:05,058 --> 00:26:07,560
and confess
what you've done.

457
00:26:07,594 --> 00:26:08,728
I will if you will.

458
00:26:08,762 --> 00:26:10,997
My conscience is clear.

459
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:15,001
All that Xanax.

460
00:26:15,035 --> 00:26:17,703
My, how you must have trouble
sleeping at night.

461
00:26:17,738 --> 00:26:20,673
You don't know
shit about me.

462
00:26:20,707 --> 00:26:22,775
Can we have a minute?

463
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:23,976
Except that you're
the lieutenant of homicide

464
00:26:24,011 --> 00:26:25,778
and you wear
a big shiny badge,

465
00:26:25,812 --> 00:26:31,384
and yet you know exactly
what your brother is.

466
00:26:31,418 --> 00:26:33,719
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

467
00:26:33,754 --> 00:26:36,489
They wouldn't believe me
even if I did.

468
00:26:36,523 --> 00:26:39,058
But knowing that you
have to live with it

469
00:26:39,092 --> 00:26:42,061
is, um, punishment enough.

470
00:26:42,095 --> 00:26:44,397
Still, I'm curious.

471
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:49,502
How do you justify
arresting me and not him?

472
00:26:49,536 --> 00:26:51,203
Or is the law
just something

473
00:26:51,238 --> 00:26:54,040
that you make up
as you go along?

474
00:26:54,074 --> 00:26:56,776
Turning a blind eye
whenever you feel like it,

475
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,811
or whenever
Dexter is involved.

476
00:26:58,845 --> 00:27:01,147
Fuck...you.

477
00:27:01,181 --> 00:27:05,217
You are a liar and a killer.

478
00:27:05,252 --> 00:27:06,986
But not a hypocrite.

479
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,320
Ms. McKay, come on.

480
00:27:08,355 --> 00:27:11,323
Let's go.

481
00:27:13,493 --> 00:27:16,462
Hannah McKay, you are charged
with murder in the first degree

482
00:27:16,496 --> 00:27:18,464
in connection with the death
of Salvador Price.

483
00:27:18,498 --> 00:27:19,565
How do you plead?

484
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,667
My client pleads
not guilty, Your Honor.

485
00:27:21,702 --> 00:27:23,269
Ms. McKay,
you are hereby remanded

486
00:27:23,303 --> 00:27:26,038
to the state of Florida,
and bail is denied.

487
00:27:26,073 --> 00:27:28,441
No!

488
00:27:28,475 --> 00:27:30,376
Hannah.

489
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,377
I'm so sorry.

490
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:32,445
Listen to me.

491
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,180
It's gonna be fine, okay?

492
00:27:34,214 --> 00:27:36,449
Ma'am, you need
to step back, please.

493
00:27:36,483 --> 00:27:39,351
Thank you.
Good-bye.

494
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:48,861
Maria, just checking in.

495
00:27:48,895 --> 00:27:51,297
That's nice of you.

496
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:54,900
Seems everyone else
is avoiding me.

497
00:27:54,935 --> 00:27:56,368
You know how it is.

498
00:27:56,403 --> 00:27:58,204
Everyone is waiting
to see where this lands.

499
00:27:58,238 --> 00:28:00,072
I'm doing everything I can
to make sure

500
00:28:00,107 --> 00:28:02,141
it doesn't land
on my head.

501
00:28:02,175 --> 00:28:04,677
You need to show up
to my party.

502
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:08,114
I really don't think anyone
wants to see me there.

503
00:28:08,148 --> 00:28:11,517
Of course they do.

504
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:14,253
It's also an opportunity
for you to apologize to Dexter.

505
00:28:14,287 --> 00:28:16,122
A public act
of contrition.

506
00:28:16,156 --> 00:28:17,990
If you straighten it out
with him,

507
00:28:18,024 --> 00:28:19,725
he can tell
the people upstairs

508
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,495
that it was just
a misunderstanding.

509
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:24,530
Either way,
show up tonight.

510
00:28:24,564 --> 00:28:26,198
It's not just New Year's Eve.

511
00:28:26,233 --> 00:28:28,167
It's also
my retirement party.

512
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:29,435
Oh.

513
00:28:29,469 --> 00:28:32,138
It wouldn't feel right
without you.

514
00:28:32,172 --> 00:28:35,141
I'll be there.

515
00:28:48,522 --> 00:28:52,024
1,500 ccs, supercharged...

516
00:28:58,732 --> 00:29:03,536
Shit!
What the fuck?

517
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,404
Seward Memorial
Hospital, now!

518
00:29:05,438 --> 00:29:08,407
She's having
some sort of seizure.

519
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,280
She seems stable.

520
00:29:14,314 --> 00:29:18,284
We're bringing her into Seward
Memorial emergency right now.

521
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:25,357
We'd better contact
her next of kin.

522
00:29:25,392 --> 00:29:27,660
Hang on, sweetheart.

523
00:29:27,694 --> 00:29:31,697
Go ahead and get her an MRI,
make sure it's with contrast.

524
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:10,469
Let's hope
my hunch is right.

525
00:30:10,503 --> 00:30:12,605
That the pull
of a long-past romance

526
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:16,041
is enough to compel
Florencia to help Estrada.

527
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:19,912
You wanted to talk.

528
00:30:19,946 --> 00:30:23,716
Deb, come in
and have a seat.

529
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,652
What's up?

530
00:30:26,686 --> 00:30:28,787
You were right.

531
00:30:28,822 --> 00:30:32,124
- About?
- Me.

532
00:30:32,158 --> 00:30:36,362
I let my feelings
for Sergeant Doakes

533
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:38,497
affect my decision-making.

534
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:40,733
What I put
your brother through

535
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:46,372
was negligent
and unforgivable.

536
00:30:46,406 --> 00:30:50,843
And I'm sorry.

537
00:30:50,877 --> 00:30:54,713
If it's any consolation,
my career is gonna take a hit.

538
00:30:54,748 --> 00:30:58,350
Suspension,
probably worse.

539
00:30:58,385 --> 00:31:00,185
I hope not.

540
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,255
You don't have to say that.

541
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:07,493
Either way, in the event
I'm not around much longer,

542
00:31:07,527 --> 00:31:11,997
I wanna leave things
in some kind of order.

543
00:31:12,032 --> 00:31:15,634
I was trying so hard to prove
that the Bay Harbor Butcher

544
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:18,537
was still active,
I overlooked some loose ends

545
00:31:18,571 --> 00:31:20,239
on Travis Marshall's death.

546
00:31:20,273 --> 00:31:23,075
I was hoping you could
help me with the timeline.

547
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:25,277
Sure.

548
00:31:25,312 --> 00:31:29,281
Okay, according
to Dexter's statement,

549
00:31:29,316 --> 00:31:32,785
previous to the day we found
Travis Marshall's body

550
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:35,854
he was doing his final forensics
sweep on the church.

551
00:31:35,889 --> 00:31:38,657
- Yeah, that's right.
- Under your supervision.

552
00:31:38,692 --> 00:31:41,327
No...I mean,
yes, I sent him,

553
00:31:41,361 --> 00:31:42,695
but he was on his own.

554
00:31:42,729 --> 00:31:44,630
He doesn't need
someone to watch him.

555
00:31:44,664 --> 00:31:48,000
You didn't go to the church
that day or evening?

556
00:31:48,034 --> 00:31:50,102
No.

557
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:51,637
You sure?

558
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:54,640
Yes.

559
00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:03,849
When I was going through
the mail this morning,

560
00:32:03,883 --> 00:32:06,151
I got a package
from Mike Anderson's widow.

561
00:32:06,186 --> 00:32:09,688
And it seems that
before Mike died,

562
00:32:09,723 --> 00:32:11,924
he ordered security footage

563
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:13,892
from all gas stations
around the church.

564
00:32:13,927 --> 00:32:19,331
And...somehow this got lumped
into his personal belongings.

565
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:24,870
It recently
got sent to me, so...

566
00:32:24,904 --> 00:32:28,240
Can you see that?

567
00:32:28,274 --> 00:32:30,576
That's two blocks
from the church.

568
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,078
And there's a timestamp.

569
00:32:33,113 --> 00:32:37,249
It was 22 minutes before
the fire department got the call

570
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:42,054
on the burning church.

571
00:32:42,088 --> 00:32:45,057
What were you doing there,
Lieutenant?

572
00:32:47,293 --> 00:32:50,462
What it looks like.
I was getting gas.

573
00:32:50,497 --> 00:32:52,331
Then why lie about it?

574
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:55,801
I didn't lie.
I forgot.

575
00:32:55,835 --> 00:32:57,936
It was a crazy night.

576
00:32:57,971 --> 00:33:01,173
You were certain
about it a moment ago.

577
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:05,744
No I'm--I'm sorry.
I--

578
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:07,980
I took some food to Dexter
at the church,

579
00:33:08,014 --> 00:33:10,049
but I was only there for,
like, 30 seconds.

580
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:13,285
So I didn't think
that it was worth remembering.

581
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:16,755
- And then you got some gas.
- Yes.

582
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,992
That you put in a gas can?

583
00:33:20,026 --> 00:33:23,262
Yeah.

584
00:33:23,296 --> 00:33:24,963
Why in the world--

585
00:33:24,998 --> 00:33:26,865
Captain,
where is this going?

586
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,903
That's up to you,
Lieutenant.

587
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:35,007
Debra...

588
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:38,710
we've known each other
a long time.

589
00:33:38,745 --> 00:33:43,749
Is there something
you wanna get off your chest?

590
00:33:51,224 --> 00:33:54,159
Yes.

591
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:09,641
I think you've been under
a lot of stress.

592
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,249
You know what I think?

593
00:34:20,153 --> 00:34:24,690
I think I'm not the only one
who made a mistake

594
00:34:24,724 --> 00:34:28,727
trying to protect
someone they care about.

595
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:36,034
Is there anything else,
Captain?

596
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:38,270
Not for now.

597
00:34:38,304 --> 00:34:42,274
But this is just the start
of a much larger conversation.

598
00:34:44,611 --> 00:34:47,613
Count on it.

599
00:35:15,508 --> 00:35:17,543
Estrada.

600
00:35:19,746 --> 00:35:23,215
I guess some bonds
are unbreakable.

601
00:35:23,249 --> 00:35:27,186
We never leave behind
the ones we love.

602
00:35:37,063 --> 00:35:39,998
He could be there all day.

603
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:48,173
And you can keep that,
all right?

604
00:35:52,145 --> 00:35:55,080
Hey!

605
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:12,731
Hi, Deb.

606
00:36:12,765 --> 00:36:15,968
W--now?

607
00:36:16,002 --> 00:36:17,536
Okay.

608
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,472
Give me 15 minutes.

609
00:36:20,506 --> 00:36:22,107
She's still unconscious,
but the seizures have stopped

610
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:23,475
and we've got her stabilized.

611
00:36:23,509 --> 00:36:25,143
We're waiting for a doctor.

612
00:36:25,178 --> 00:36:26,645
We could use
your help over here.

613
00:36:38,024 --> 00:36:40,058
Okay.

614
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:42,861
LaGuerta knew
I was lying, Dex.

615
00:36:42,895 --> 00:36:47,266
Wait, wait,
let me think.

616
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,368
What?

617
00:36:49,402 --> 00:36:51,003
This is bad, Deb.

618
00:36:51,037 --> 00:36:53,538
I don't wanna
fucking hear you say that.

619
00:36:53,573 --> 00:36:55,807
You always say
that you can fix it.

620
00:36:55,842 --> 00:36:57,843
I will.

621
00:36:57,877 --> 00:37:01,813
Just don't know how yet.

622
00:37:01,848 --> 00:37:04,750
Look, it was dangerous enough
when she was focused just on me,

623
00:37:04,784 --> 00:37:06,184
but now that
she's pulled you into this,

624
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:08,320
well, it's worse.

625
00:37:08,354 --> 00:37:10,188
Tell me about it.

626
00:37:11,891 --> 00:37:13,892
I know I've said this
a hundred times--

627
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:16,128
But you're sorry
that I got involved in this.

628
00:37:16,162 --> 00:37:19,498
I am.

629
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:22,467
Are we really that fucked?

630
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,439
Look, all she knows
is that you bought some gas.

631
00:37:27,473 --> 00:37:29,174
That's not a crime.

632
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:31,877
Yeah, but buying gas
to burn down a church

633
00:37:31,911 --> 00:37:34,413
to cover up the fact that you
killed Travis Marshall is.

634
00:37:34,447 --> 00:37:35,814
And she knows that.

635
00:37:35,848 --> 00:37:38,050
But she can't prove it.

636
00:37:38,084 --> 00:37:40,319
Yet.

637
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:42,287
I need to know
what else she has,

638
00:37:42,322 --> 00:37:43,622
what her next move is.

639
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:47,225
If all she's got is that DVD,
I can handle this.

640
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,561
Is this ever gonna end?

641
00:37:49,595 --> 00:37:52,597
Yeah, it will.

642
00:37:55,735 --> 00:37:57,569
Just go back to work.

643
00:37:57,603 --> 00:38:00,939
Try and act normal.

644
00:38:00,973 --> 00:38:03,809
Normal?
What the fuck is normal?

645
00:38:03,843 --> 00:38:04,843
Just do the best you can.

646
00:38:04,844 --> 00:38:06,044
I'll deal with LaGuerta.

647
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,880
What the hell is that?

648
00:38:08,915 --> 00:38:11,850
Estrada.

649
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:27,579
Oh, shit.
Let's go!

650
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,301
This is Officer Armes
calling for backup.

651
00:38:29,335 --> 00:38:32,938
We need units
at Seward Memorial.

652
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,521
LaGuerta's house.

653
00:38:49,555 --> 00:38:52,991
What is it you're hoping
to find, Dexter?

654
00:38:53,025 --> 00:38:55,994
I don't know.

655
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,103
Not this.

656
00:39:05,138 --> 00:39:07,205
Warrants.

657
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,907
With a judge's signature...

658
00:39:08,941 --> 00:39:14,346
allowing LaGuerta to track
the GPS on my phone and Debra's

659
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,848
the night
the church burned down.

660
00:39:16,883 --> 00:39:19,017
Once this warrant
goes through,

661
00:39:19,051 --> 00:39:20,285
LaGuerta will
have a timeline

662
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:21,953
for the night
I killed Travis Marshall.

663
00:39:21,988 --> 00:39:24,456
She'll know that Debra
went to the church,

664
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,691
then the gas station.

665
00:39:26,726 --> 00:39:30,662
And then
back to the church...

666
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:34,499
Proving that we both were at
the church when it burned down,

667
00:39:34,534 --> 00:39:38,003
and proving that Deb
was my accomplice.

668
00:39:38,037 --> 00:39:40,505
I think it's time
to run, Dexter.

669
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,341
But Deb?
I can't leave her behind.

670
00:39:43,376 --> 00:39:45,177
Take her with you.

671
00:39:45,211 --> 00:39:47,379
Debra and Harrison--
just go.

672
00:39:47,413 --> 00:39:49,247
You knew one day
it would come to this.

673
00:39:49,282 --> 00:39:51,116
Deb could never
live like that.

674
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:55,420
That's always
been the plan, Dexter.

675
00:39:55,455 --> 00:39:57,155
That was before.

676
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,191
It's not just Deb.

677
00:39:59,225 --> 00:40:01,726
I don't wanna run either.

678
00:40:01,761 --> 00:40:03,328
Before?
Before what?

679
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:05,063
Before everything.

680
00:40:05,097 --> 00:40:07,432
Before I married Rita,
before I had a son,

681
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:10,569
before Deb knew who I was,
before I fell in love.

682
00:40:10,603 --> 00:40:12,083
What difference
does any of that make?

683
00:40:12,104 --> 00:40:14,873
Somewhere along the line,
the fake life that we created

684
00:40:14,907 --> 00:40:17,709
as a cover for me
to kill became real.

685
00:40:17,743 --> 00:40:21,513
It's not fake to me anymore.

686
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:24,616
I don't want to lose it.

687
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,685
I'm gonna stand my ground.

688
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:30,722
I don't see
any other options here, Dexter.

689
00:40:34,026 --> 00:40:37,762
But I do.

690
00:40:37,797 --> 00:40:39,798
No.

691
00:40:39,832 --> 00:40:43,034
Dexter, you have never done
a kill like this.

692
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:44,936
I'm about to.

693
00:40:44,971 --> 00:40:46,638
No.

694
00:40:46,672 --> 00:40:49,674
LaGuerta's an innocent.

695
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:51,810
She doesn't even begin
to meet the code.

696
00:40:51,844 --> 00:40:53,912
It's the only option.

697
00:40:53,946 --> 00:40:56,982
I can't let Deb go down
for what I've done.

698
00:40:57,016 --> 00:40:59,951
My God, Dexter.

699
00:41:03,523 --> 00:41:06,491
How did we end up here?

700
00:41:10,496 --> 00:41:14,266
Morning, Dex.

701
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,835
Gonna pick up some steaks
and beer tonight, yeah?

702
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:18,637
Sounds good.

703
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:20,205
Hey, Morgan,
the kind of doughnut you choose

704
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:23,975
says a lot about a man.

705
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,143
You might want
to avoid Doakes.

706
00:41:25,177 --> 00:41:26,177
He's in a bad mood.

707
00:41:26,212 --> 00:41:27,178
First the LT dumps him,

708
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:28,179
and now
his prostitute killer

709
00:41:28,214 --> 00:41:30,248
seems to have gone missing.

710
00:41:30,283 --> 00:41:34,286
- I love these.
- Thanks.

711
00:41:37,223 --> 00:41:38,456
Get one while they last.

712
00:41:38,491 --> 00:41:41,026
I don't want no fucking
doughnut, Morgan.

713
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,661
Sorry.

714
00:41:42,695 --> 00:41:47,098
Hell, it's not you,
it's LaGuerta.

715
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:51,102
I should have never gotten
involved with her to begin with.

716
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,307
Never jump the fence
if you're not willing

717
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:58,343
to face what's
on the other side.

718
00:41:58,377 --> 00:42:00,078
Where the fuck
did you hear that?

719
00:42:00,112 --> 00:42:05,250
A friend said it to me
in a moment of stress.

720
00:42:05,284 --> 00:42:09,287
Bullshit.
You don't have any friends.

721
00:42:12,058 --> 00:42:16,161
This is the journal of that
motherfucking hooker killer,

722
00:42:16,195 --> 00:42:18,129
Walter Munro.

723
00:42:18,164 --> 00:42:19,898
I took it from his place
a couple of weeks ago

724
00:42:19,932 --> 00:42:22,100
while serving a warrant.

725
00:42:22,134 --> 00:42:23,602
It's been locked up
in my drawer ever since.

726
00:42:23,636 --> 00:42:26,204
"Never jump the fence
if you're not willing

727
00:42:26,238 --> 00:42:30,408
to face what's
on the other side."

728
00:42:31,711 --> 00:42:33,078
That's a weird coincidence.

729
00:42:33,112 --> 00:42:34,079
Fuck coincidences.

730
00:42:34,113 --> 00:42:35,714
I don't believe in 'em.

731
00:42:35,748 --> 00:42:38,717
Anyway, I should--

732
00:42:38,751 --> 00:42:39,751
There's something off
about you, Morgan.

733
00:42:39,785 --> 00:42:41,653
I should have
seen it before.

734
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:45,290
The fake smile,
the doughnuts.

735
00:42:45,324 --> 00:42:47,425
You don't even walk
like a normal person.

736
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,660
You glide.

737
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:53,264
Like a...
fucking lizard on ice.

738
00:42:53,299 --> 00:42:54,499
It's all a fucking act.

739
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:56,635
And I ain't buying it.

740
00:42:56,669 --> 00:43:00,739
I think you're overreacting.

741
00:43:00,773 --> 00:43:04,309
You're hiding something.

742
00:43:04,343 --> 00:43:08,580
And one day I'm gonna
figure out what it is.

743
00:43:08,614 --> 00:43:12,550
You are one
creep motherfucker.

744
00:43:19,558 --> 00:43:22,661
It was a mistake to try
to act human in front of Doakes.

745
00:43:22,695 --> 00:43:27,599
All I did was reveal
how fake I was.

746
00:43:29,502 --> 00:43:31,169
Captain LaGuerta.

747
00:43:31,203 --> 00:43:32,971
Oye,
this is Hector Estrada.

748
00:43:33,005 --> 00:43:34,272
You're alive?

749
00:43:34,306 --> 00:43:35,540
I need your help.

750
00:43:35,574 --> 00:43:37,475
I'm back here
at the shipyard.

751
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:40,478
Same container.

752
00:43:51,457 --> 00:43:55,627
That's good.
Very convincing.

753
00:43:55,661 --> 00:43:57,028
You're gonna
let me go now, right?

754
00:43:57,063 --> 00:43:58,797
No.

755
00:43:58,831 --> 00:44:00,532
You said--

756
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:03,835
You think I'm a killer
and not a liar?

757
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:11,176
Now this is a kill
I've been looking forward to

758
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:12,877
for a long time.

759
00:44:12,912 --> 00:44:18,583
You're the one who started
this all, so many years ago.

760
00:44:18,617 --> 00:44:20,552
Should auld acquaintance
be forgot?

761
00:44:20,586 --> 00:44:23,555
- No, no, but--
- It's a rhetorical question.

762
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:27,592
Look, I'm sorry I killed
your mother, all right?

763
00:44:29,662 --> 00:44:32,063
Was it hard?

764
00:44:32,098 --> 00:44:35,533
Making the decision
to kill her?

765
00:44:35,568 --> 00:44:37,001
Yes.

766
00:44:37,036 --> 00:44:38,403
Yeah, man.

767
00:44:38,437 --> 00:44:40,972
It was the hardest decision
of my life.

768
00:44:41,006 --> 00:44:42,540
Look, I didn't wanna do it.

769
00:44:42,575 --> 00:44:44,342
You're lying.

770
00:44:44,376 --> 00:44:46,745
She was a snitch.

771
00:44:46,779 --> 00:44:48,279
It was a matter of survival.

772
00:44:48,314 --> 00:44:49,614
It was her or me.

773
00:44:49,648 --> 00:44:52,350
Come on,
this was 40 years ago.

774
00:44:52,384 --> 00:44:54,319
What are we still
talking about this?

775
00:44:54,353 --> 00:44:57,555
Well, when we finish talking,
I kill you.

776
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:01,726
Okay, okay.

777
00:45:01,761 --> 00:45:05,563
What else
do you want to know?

778
00:45:05,598 --> 00:45:08,800
Did it make you feel bad?

779
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:11,069
Look, I said I--

780
00:45:11,103 --> 00:45:14,706
it was her or me.

781
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,307
Survival of the fittest?

782
00:45:16,342 --> 00:45:18,443
Yeah, exactly.

783
00:45:18,477 --> 00:45:20,678
Killing you will be easy,

784
00:45:20,713 --> 00:45:23,148
but I have another kill
I have to do

785
00:45:23,182 --> 00:45:27,185
that's not so easy.

786
00:45:27,219 --> 00:45:30,221
So why are
you doing it, man?

787
00:45:30,256 --> 00:45:34,425
To protect myself.
And my sister.

788
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,695
Exactly.
Survival.

789
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,130
Right?

790
00:45:39,165 --> 00:45:40,899
The normal reasons.

791
00:45:40,933 --> 00:45:45,003
The normal reasons.

792
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:49,774
I've never killed
for normal reasons.

793
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:51,676
I used to think
I was special.

794
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,511
I'm a special
kind of killer,

795
00:45:53,546 --> 00:45:56,948
but tonight, I'm not.

796
00:45:56,982 --> 00:45:59,851
I hear you, bro.

797
00:45:59,885 --> 00:46:02,220
I hear you.

798
00:46:02,254 --> 00:46:04,989
So then what are you, man?

799
00:46:05,024 --> 00:46:07,992
What am I?

800
00:46:08,027 --> 00:46:13,031
I'm just a...
Creep motherfucker.

801
00:46:29,715 --> 00:46:35,320
?

802
00:46:35,354 --> 00:46:37,288
- Jamie.
- Hey, Deb.

803
00:46:37,323 --> 00:46:39,390
- Hey, have you seen Dex?
- No, he was supposed to be here

804
00:46:39,425 --> 00:46:41,259
to pick up Harrison.
The little guy was so tired,

805
00:46:41,293 --> 00:46:42,827
I put him down
in the back office.

806
00:46:42,862 --> 00:46:44,395
Well, if you see him
will you let him know

807
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:47,131
I'm looking for him?
Yeah, of course.

808
00:46:47,166 --> 00:46:48,967
Happy New Year.

809
00:46:49,001 --> 00:46:50,001
What?

810
00:46:50,035 --> 00:46:51,469
Fuck, sorry.

811
00:46:51,503 --> 00:46:55,840
Happy New Year.

812
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:58,910
Oh, slow down, cowboy.

813
00:46:58,944 --> 00:47:01,913
I'll share.

814
00:47:04,483 --> 00:47:07,185
I heard that you broke up
with your girlfriend.

815
00:47:07,219 --> 00:47:09,020
She dumped me.

816
00:47:09,054 --> 00:47:11,322
So are you gonna get
all sloppy drunk

817
00:47:11,357 --> 00:47:13,658
and make an ass of yourself
like you did

818
00:47:13,692 --> 00:47:16,895
when you broke up with Deb?
I was thinking about it.

819
00:47:16,929 --> 00:47:18,596
You gonna
hit on me again too?

820
00:47:20,499 --> 00:47:22,100
'Cause I'm just saying,
fair warning,

821
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:25,203
I do not need my brother
to protect me.

822
00:47:25,237 --> 00:47:27,472
And if you don't
show me respect,

823
00:47:27,506 --> 00:47:30,441
I will fuck you up

824
00:47:30,476 --> 00:47:33,177
and serve you balls
in a shot glass.

825
00:47:33,212 --> 00:47:37,181
How do you make that
sound so fucking sexy?

826
00:47:39,752 --> 00:47:41,219
- Everything good here?
- Just fine.

827
00:47:41,253 --> 00:47:43,421
- Yep.
- Good.

828
00:47:43,455 --> 00:47:46,457
Mmhmm.

829
00:47:49,962 --> 00:47:51,729
- Hey, Hermano.
- Hey.

830
00:47:51,764 --> 00:47:54,499
So how's it feel?

831
00:47:54,533 --> 00:47:55,867
Knowing you're putting away
your badge?

832
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:59,370
Honestly,
a little scary.

833
00:47:59,405 --> 00:48:00,905
All I've been is a cop.

834
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,408
I'm putting it
all behind me, you know?

835
00:48:03,442 --> 00:48:04,409
Unknown territory.

836
00:48:04,443 --> 00:48:06,277
That takes balls, man.

837
00:48:06,312 --> 00:48:08,880
Oh, hey,
it's almost time.

838
00:48:08,914 --> 00:48:11,382
Uh, where can I go
to change?

839
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:12,951
No, you're not gonna
put on a diaper

840
00:48:12,985 --> 00:48:14,018
and come out
as baby new year.

841
00:48:14,053 --> 00:48:15,186
That's--no.

842
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,256
- Try and stop me.
- No.

843
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:20,224
You're gonna scare people
is what you're gon--

844
00:48:20,259 --> 00:48:21,292
Great party, Angel.

845
00:48:21,327 --> 00:48:22,593
Thanks.
Is your brother here?

846
00:48:22,628 --> 00:48:24,362
I was just gonna ask you
the same thing.

847
00:48:24,396 --> 00:48:26,030
He said he was gonna be here.
Yeah, Maria too.

848
00:48:26,065 --> 00:48:27,365
Maybe after
what happened yesterday,

849
00:48:27,399 --> 00:48:28,700
they want
to avoid each other.

850
00:48:28,734 --> 00:48:29,834
Yeah. Maybe.

851
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:30,969
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna call

852
00:48:31,003 --> 00:48:33,237
and make sure he's okay.
Okay.

853
00:48:33,272 --> 00:48:35,606
Dispatch.

854
00:48:35,641 --> 00:48:37,375
Dispatch, this is
Lieutenant Debra Morgan.

855
00:48:37,409 --> 00:48:39,877
I was hoping to get a 20
on Captain LaGuerta's vehicle.

856
00:48:39,912 --> 00:48:41,412
I'll wait.

857
00:48:41,447 --> 00:48:43,881
Her vehicle is heading north
to the Miami port,

858
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:45,216
by the shipping yards.

859
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,517
The shipping yard?
Are you sure?

860
00:48:46,552 --> 00:48:50,488
- That's correct.
- Thank you.

861
00:48:56,328 --> 00:48:57,662
Dex, it's Deb.
Whatever you're thinking

862
00:48:57,696 --> 00:49:00,665
of doing,
please don't do it.

863
00:50:18,377 --> 00:50:22,013
So what's the plan?

864
00:50:22,047 --> 00:50:25,116
I gave LaGuerta
half a dose of M99

865
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,985
so it won't be found
in her system.

866
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:32,657
I'll use her gun to shoot
Estrada in his puncture wound.

867
00:50:32,691 --> 00:50:36,160
Destroying any evidence
that he was stabbed.

868
00:50:36,195 --> 00:50:38,863
And then?

869
00:50:38,897 --> 00:50:40,631
Tell me.

870
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:42,967
I'll use Estrada's gun
to shoot LaGuerta.

871
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:45,136
So it'll look
like they killed each other.

872
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,638
Yes.

873
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:50,708
Dexter.

874
00:50:50,742 --> 00:50:53,744
Where will this end?

875
00:51:11,964 --> 00:51:14,465
Shit, Dex,
what have you done?

876
00:51:26,745 --> 00:51:28,880
Deb?

877
00:51:28,914 --> 00:51:31,349
Oh, God.

878
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:32,850
Dexter.

879
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:36,988
You shouldn't be here.

880
00:51:37,022 --> 00:51:42,026
Why...shouldn't I be here?

881
00:51:43,162 --> 00:51:45,897
What are you doing?

882
00:51:45,931 --> 00:51:48,199
What needs to be done.

883
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:49,800
Are you gonna kill her?

884
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:52,403
You need to leave.

885
00:51:52,437 --> 00:51:55,039
I need to finish this.
Dexter, you can't.

886
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:56,874
I can.
And I will.

887
00:51:56,909 --> 00:51:58,075
No, fuck, Jesus.

888
00:51:58,110 --> 00:51:59,177
Dexter, you can't do this.

889
00:52:00,212 --> 00:52:01,445
It's the only solution.

890
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,647
The only way to end this.

891
00:52:02,681 --> 00:52:03,781
No, no, no,
I can't let you

892
00:52:03,815 --> 00:52:05,349
go through with this!

893
00:52:05,384 --> 00:52:08,352
Shoot him, Debra.

894
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:13,257
You have to end this.

895
00:52:13,292 --> 00:52:17,228
Shoot him.

896
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:18,696
Stop!

897
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:21,399
Do it, Debra.
Shoot him!

898
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:24,202
Do it!
Shoot him!

899
00:52:24,236 --> 00:52:27,872
This is not who you are.

900
00:52:27,906 --> 00:52:30,274
You're a good cop.

901
00:52:30,309 --> 00:52:31,275
You're a good person.

902
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,911
You're not like him.

903
00:52:33,946 --> 00:52:36,948
Put him down!

904
00:52:39,384 --> 00:52:42,286
It's true.
Everything she said.

905
00:52:42,321 --> 00:52:45,856
You're a good person.

906
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:48,859
It's okay.

907
00:52:55,801 --> 00:52:59,804
Do what you gotta do.

908
00:53:08,313 --> 00:53:11,315
Dex.

909
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:21,592
Oh, my God!

910
00:53:21,627 --> 00:53:26,597
Oh, my God!

911
00:53:59,765 --> 00:54:03,968
We all make rules
for ourselves.

912
00:54:04,002 --> 00:54:07,972
It's these rules that help
define who we are.

913
00:54:10,976 --> 00:54:15,212
So when we break those rules,
we risk losing ourselves

914
00:54:15,247 --> 00:54:17,248
and becoming
something unknown.

915
00:54:17,282 --> 00:54:20,451
Who is Deb now?

916
00:54:20,485 --> 00:54:22,720
Who am I?

917
00:54:22,754 --> 00:54:26,657
Is this a new beginning?

918
00:54:26,692 --> 00:54:30,628
Or the beginning of the end?

919
00:54:36,735 --> 00:54:40,371
?

920
00:54:40,405 --> 00:54:46,110
? should auld acquaintance
be forgot ?

921
00:54:46,144 --> 00:54:51,916
? and days
of auld lang syne ?

922
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:56,487
? for auld lang syne
my dear ?

923
00:54:57,734 --> 00:55:02,734
