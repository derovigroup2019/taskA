Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

6
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,871
She accepts both sides of me.

7
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:48,239
The whole Dexter.

8
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:50,174
How in the hell
does the most

9
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,742
crucial piece
of evidence against

10
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:54,311
Isaak Sirko just disappear?

11
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:55,412
I did what you wanted.

12
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:56,980
The evidence
against Sirko is gone.

13
00:01:57,014 --> 00:01:59,081
I want Nadia's passport.
She's done with you

14
00:01:59,116 --> 00:02:01,517
and your whole shitty
fucking organization.

15
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:03,052
That's not
gonna happen, Joey,

16
00:02:03,086 --> 00:02:05,420
so you think real hard
about your next move.

17
00:02:05,455 --> 00:02:07,723
I'm at a dead end
on Bay Harbor butcher.

18
00:02:07,757 --> 00:02:10,225
Everything we've done,
all the evidence,

19
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,027
it still points
to Sergeant Doakes.

20
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:16,264
At some point,
we have to face facts.

21
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:18,099
Harrison is only going
to Orlando

22
00:02:18,134 --> 00:02:20,168
for a few weeks, Dexter.

23
00:02:20,202 --> 00:02:21,502
He's gonna be fine.

24
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:24,071
All he'll want to do
is follow Cody around.

25
00:02:24,106 --> 00:02:26,607
Every time the shit
hits the fan, I go to him.

26
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:28,342
He's your safe place.

27
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:29,743
You're making it sound
like I want to

28
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:32,012
be with him or something.

29
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:33,914
Well, do you?

30
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:36,549
You didn't kill Viktor
out of vengeance.

31
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:39,852
I have a feeling that you're
a different kind of animal.

32
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:41,721
I can't even have
a drink with someone

33
00:02:41,755 --> 00:02:43,189
without them dying.
I'm sorry, Deb.

34
00:02:43,223 --> 00:02:44,890
I wish I could tell you
what happened.

35
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:46,058
I know what happened.

36
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:48,427
Hannah McKay.

37
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:50,829
Sal Price was writing
a book on you.

38
00:02:50,863 --> 00:02:52,230
You didn't like it,
so you poisoned him.

39
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:54,299
That's crazy.

40
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,434
Report's back on
the tox screen on Sal Price.

41
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,436
M.E. ran it twice.
Negative both times.

42
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,639
That fucking bitch is gonna
get away with it again.

43
00:03:02,673 --> 00:03:04,908
Hannah McKay
killed Sal Price

44
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:09,078
and she's gonna walk.

45
00:03:09,113 --> 00:03:11,213
I want you
to make it right.

46
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:13,148
Do what you do.

47
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:25,159
Was Deb's call
just a bad dream?

48
00:03:30,798 --> 00:03:33,066
Or does she really want me
to kill Hannah?

49
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,768
Morning.

50
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:39,405
- How did you sleep?
- Okay.

51
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,873
Special herbs
from my garden.

52
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:43,109
It's my secret ingredient.

53
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:49,882
How can I help?

54
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:54,821
Uh, you can dice.

55
00:04:01,995 --> 00:04:04,997
It's, uh, more my style.

56
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:24,751
I sometimes
lose track of time,

57
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:27,120
but your calendar
goes beyond that.

58
00:04:27,154 --> 00:04:31,527
Oh, it's not so much
a calendar, but a reminder.

59
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,998
That's the year
you took off with Wayne.

60
00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:37,534
It's not about Wayne.

61
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,404
It's Argentina.

62
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,974
What was so special
about Argentina?

63
00:04:42,008 --> 00:04:44,210
Nothing, really, I just--
I like the picture.

64
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:48,515
It looks like... nice.

65
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,052
Happy.
A home.

66
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,835
My sister,

67
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,370
who's also my lieutenant,

68
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:08,909
so I should probably
get to work soon.

69
00:05:08,943 --> 00:05:10,912
Your sister
is the lieutenant?

70
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:13,216
Yeah,
I didn't mention that.

71
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,253
No, you didn't.

72
00:05:21,193 --> 00:05:23,895
Is this crazy?

73
00:05:23,929 --> 00:05:26,065
"This"?

74
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:28,101
You and me,

75
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:31,571
just sitting here,
eating breakfast.

76
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:33,407
I always eat breakfast.

77
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:36,443
It's important.

78
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:41,882
I-I know
that we decided

79
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,685
to never
see each other again,

80
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,353
so I just want you
to know that

81
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,822
if last night was
a one-night thing for you,

82
00:05:48,856 --> 00:05:51,124
then I'm okay with that.

83
00:05:51,158 --> 00:05:54,828
Okay.

84
00:05:54,862 --> 00:05:57,263
But if you want
to never see each other again

85
00:05:57,298 --> 00:06:00,132
tomorrow night,
then I'm okay with that too.

86
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:03,902
Okay.

87
00:06:03,937 --> 00:06:06,471
You're very agreeable.

88
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:10,374
Yep.

89
00:06:12,477 --> 00:06:15,278
I need to find some way
to get her out of Debra's head,

90
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:18,014
even if I can't get her
out of mine.

91
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:29,792
Hey, come on in.

92
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:31,261
Do you want coffee?

93
00:06:31,295 --> 00:06:33,796
There's plenty.
I couldn't fucking sleep.

94
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:36,799
Sure.

95
00:06:45,776 --> 00:06:46,776
Deb?

96
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,045
Yeah?

97
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,048
What you said last night,
you didn't mean it.

98
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:55,618
Did you?

99
00:06:55,652 --> 00:06:58,989
Yeah, Dex, I meant it.

100
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,525
The good news is
I've already vetted her for you.

101
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:05,528
She's killed three people
that we know of.

102
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:07,831
That's not including
what she did with Wayne.

103
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:09,933
And Price had a tissue sample

104
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:11,935
and a lab report
on Beverly Grey

105
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,271
that proved she was poisoned
with aconite.

106
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:17,708
But, go figure, some asshole
broke into his apartment

107
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:19,810
and disappeared
all the files on Hannah.

108
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:21,278
Thank you very much.

109
00:07:21,312 --> 00:07:23,480
You're welcome.

110
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:25,582
You don't know
she killed Price.

111
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:27,284
You don't even know Price
was murdered.

112
00:07:27,318 --> 00:07:31,222
You want to know what
he was doing the day he died?

113
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:33,958
He was recording this.

114
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:35,359
Then she just

115
00:07:35,393 --> 00:07:39,897
kept screaming,
and there was so much blood.

116
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:43,901
What did you do?

117
00:07:43,936 --> 00:07:47,672
I stabbed her
until the screaming stopped.

118
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:52,577
Deb, she was 15.

119
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:53,745
You want more?

120
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,346
Let's talk about how
she didn't allow

121
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:58,950
her husband's body
to be embalmed.

122
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:03,622
She fits your code, Dex.

123
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:08,694
I'm not killing
Hannah McKay.

124
00:08:15,102 --> 00:08:19,105
You know how hard it was
for me to ask you that?

125
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:23,810
I have been going around
in my head in circles

126
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:25,479
trying to come up
with something,

127
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:27,314
with anything
that I can fucking use,

128
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:30,050
but I've got nothing.

129
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:31,218
Sal and I were so close.

130
00:08:31,253 --> 00:08:35,522
If that body
hadn't decomposed...

131
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,525
We'd fucking have her.
She'd be locked up.

132
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,628
He would be alive.

133
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:42,062
But he's dead,
and Hannah McKay

134
00:08:42,097 --> 00:08:43,631
is walking around,
free to kill again.

135
00:08:43,665 --> 00:08:45,932
And she will
fucking kill again, Dexter.

136
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:48,668
That's who she is.

137
00:08:48,703 --> 00:08:52,672
And I can't let that happen.
Not after Speltzer.

138
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:56,676
I wish
there was another way.

139
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,614
You're all I have left.

140
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,269
What's up?

141
00:09:22,303 --> 00:09:23,704
It's Astor.

142
00:09:23,738 --> 00:09:25,438
"Grandpa's kidney stones
are acting up again.

143
00:09:25,473 --> 00:09:27,073
"Grandma's taking him
to the doctor.

144
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,609
Hopefully it's not
too serious."

145
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:39,719
Deb, you told me you didn't want
to be a part of what I do.

146
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:40,920
That was before
I realized--

147
00:09:40,954 --> 00:09:42,355
You could hardly
live with yourself

148
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:44,390
when you lied
to Batista for me.

149
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:45,858
How do you think
you're gonna live with knowing

150
00:09:45,893 --> 00:09:47,993
that you're responsible
for a murder?

151
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:51,364
Don't tell me what
I can and can't handle.

152
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:52,932
Turns out there's
a fuck of a lot

153
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,768
that I can live with
these days.

154
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,337
No, you can't.

155
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:57,772
Ever since you found out,

156
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,073
you've been teetering
on the edge.

157
00:09:59,107 --> 00:10:00,307
You've covered up evidence,
you've lied--

158
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:01,843
For you!

159
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:03,911
Yeah, that's why I can't
let you take it any further.

160
00:10:03,945 --> 00:10:05,413
For your own good.
For my own-

161
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:07,848
oh, you--please do not
parent me, Dexter.

162
00:10:07,883 --> 00:10:09,650
You sound like dad.

163
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:12,020
Because that's probably
what he'd say.

164
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:14,589
This isn't who you are.

165
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:18,227
Deb, I care about you too much
to let you do something

166
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:21,096
you're gonna regret.

167
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,099
I'm sorry,
the answer is no.

168
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:31,641
Well I guess it's
your fucking decision, isn't it?

169
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:33,643
Even though everything
I just said is true,

170
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:38,381
it doesn't make me
any less of a liar.

171
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:07,909
Excellent.

172
00:11:07,944 --> 00:11:09,545
The police will follow Jurg
and your bodyguard

173
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:11,380
around all afternoon.

174
00:11:11,414 --> 00:11:12,648
And then what?

175
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:14,817
The cops are dicks,
but they're not morons.

176
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:16,952
They're gonna figure out
you're not in the car.

177
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:19,121
Eventually, sure.

178
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:23,158
But by then, I'll have
taken care of my business.

179
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:27,930
Business?
What business?

180
00:11:27,964 --> 00:11:32,601
This isn't about Dexter Morgan
again, is it?

181
00:11:32,636 --> 00:11:33,869
You're not thinking
straight here.

182
00:11:33,904 --> 00:11:35,804
He works for Miami Metro.

183
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,172
We take out
one more of theirs,

184
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:40,342
they shut this place down
for good.

185
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:42,711
We have inventory to move--

186
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:46,014
tonight.

187
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:49,383
Come on, man, just--
just let it go.

188
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:55,155
You can go home.

189
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,378
Deb's got 24hour police

190
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:19,046
surveillance on Isaak.

191
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:21,649
Which means I know where
he is at all times.

192
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:24,419
He's moved into Viktor's
apartment and hardly gone

193
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:27,522
anywhere other than the Fox Hole
and a few restaurants.

194
00:12:27,556 --> 00:12:30,058
Hey, Dexter.
The usual?

195
00:12:30,092 --> 00:12:33,027
Yeah, thanks.

196
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:34,729
Hey, do you have
any Boston cremes?

197
00:12:34,763 --> 00:12:36,497
It's my sister's favorite.

198
00:12:36,532 --> 00:12:38,132
Got some fresh ones
coming out now.

199
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:39,267
Take just a minute.

200
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,869
Thanks.

201
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:43,471
Is that your plan
to keep Debra from going over

202
00:12:43,506 --> 00:12:44,639
to the dark side?

203
00:12:44,673 --> 00:12:46,741
Give her a massive
sugar rush?

204
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:48,644
I don't exactly
have a plan yet.

205
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:51,680
I can think
of an obvious one.

206
00:12:51,715 --> 00:12:53,115
I'm not gonna
stop seeing Hannah

207
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:55,784
just because
she's a murderer...

208
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:58,120
and my sister
wants to kill her.

209
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:00,189
Do you hear
how that sounds?

210
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:20,376
- What the hell?
- I don't know.

211
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,279
Those fucking gang kids
are at it again.

212
00:13:23,313 --> 00:13:26,349
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I'm calling the police.

213
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:34,124
Looks like while you were
playing house with Hannah,

214
00:13:34,158 --> 00:13:35,725
Isaak found a way
to shake the police,

215
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,528
which likely means
he'll come after you again.

216
00:13:38,562 --> 00:13:41,531
Well, if he can get past
Miami Metro homicide, so can I.

217
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:42,799
Grandpa's gone to surgery.

218
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:44,001
Grandma says we have
to stay with you in Miami.

219
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:46,504
- Oh, shit.
- What?

220
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:47,638
The kids are coming.

221
00:13:47,673 --> 00:13:50,808
"Kids" as in plural?

222
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:52,276
Grandpa has to have surgery.

223
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:55,145
I need to send Jamie
to Orlando to pick them up.

224
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:05,357
It was Isaak, wasn't it?

225
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:07,092
How the fuck did he get away
from the cops?

226
00:14:07,127 --> 00:14:08,927
Does it matter?

227
00:14:08,962 --> 00:14:10,062
Did you see him?

228
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:11,396
Yeah.

229
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:13,299
Then you're a fucking witness.
I can arrest him.

230
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,433
You already
tried that once, Deb.

231
00:14:14,468 --> 00:14:16,702
It didn't work.

232
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:18,404
You really want
an investigation

233
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:21,106
into why Isaak Sirko
is trying to kill me?

234
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:23,142
So what the fuck
am I supposed to do?

235
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:25,310
Just let me handle it.

236
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:28,446
It's not like I have
much of a choice.

237
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,314
Just be careful, okay?

238
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:31,516
There's one other thing.

239
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,585
I got a call
from the kids' grandmother.

240
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:36,621
- Harrison okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

241
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:39,324
But Bill has to have
emergency surgery,

242
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:41,759
and Maura wants me
to watch Harrison

243
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:44,629
and Astor and Cody
for a few days.

244
00:14:44,663 --> 00:14:46,865
- Now is not a good time.
- I know, but what could I say?

245
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:48,733
Jamie's on her way
to pick them up.

246
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:50,168
Well they can't stay
at your fucking apartment.

247
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:53,305
Isaak probably has
his own key by now.

248
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,607
Any ideas?

249
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:02,181
Yeah, they can stay
at my place.

250
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:05,817
I'll get patrol cars
to cover my house, just in case.

251
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:09,121
How are you gonna
explain that to LaGuerta?

252
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:12,758
I'll tell her that I'm afraid
Isaak's gonna come after me

253
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:15,260
for his arrest.

254
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:18,029
Your house
isn't exactly kid-friendly.

255
00:15:18,063 --> 00:15:20,798
- What does that mean?
- Well, you have a gun.

256
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,066
I'll lock it up.

257
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,638
And the pay channels.
Cody's 12.

258
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:29,340
Okay, I'll lock up the remote.
Anything else?

259
00:15:29,374 --> 00:15:32,911
Anything in your kitchen
besides salsa and beer?

260
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:34,546
I think there was some cheese
when I moved in.

261
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,450
I'll have Jamie
stock the fridge.

262
00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:40,185
This is gonna be great.

263
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,255
I love kids.

264
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,994
I don't love kids in general,
but I love your kids.

265
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:51,365
And Astor and Cody,
it's been a long time.

266
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,666
I'll give you a heads-up
as soon as I know

267
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,402
when they're getting in.
Thanks.

268
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:57,271
Yeah.

269
00:15:57,305 --> 00:15:58,973
What's that?

270
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:01,342
I'm gonna pay Hannah McKay
a visit.

271
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:03,511
Why?

272
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,646
Just because you're
not gonna do what you do

273
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,651
doesn't mean she gets to live
happily fucking ever after.

274
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:12,052
I guess it was foolish
to think

275
00:16:12,086 --> 00:16:14,421
Deb would simply
walk away from this.

276
00:16:18,892 --> 00:16:19,992
Hey!

277
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:22,061
I heard about
your donut shop.

278
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:23,996
Oh, yeah.
Pretty scary.

279
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:26,132
Francisco thinks
it was gang-related.

280
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,668
Showdown between
the crullers and the fritters?

281
00:16:28,702 --> 00:16:30,770
Uh, Deb?

282
00:16:30,804 --> 00:16:33,273
If you need me,
I'll be on my cell phone.

283
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:34,641
Something up?

284
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:36,376
Just some business
on the other side of town.

285
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,510
Dexter.

286
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:39,512
Ladies.

287
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:42,983
If you get a chance,
stop by papa's after work today.

288
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:44,217
It's under new management.

289
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:46,686
Shut the fuck up.
You got the restaurant?

290
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,122
The landlord and I came
to an agreement with the lease.

291
00:16:49,156 --> 00:16:51,124
Call me papa.

292
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:52,291
No, I will not do that.

293
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:54,427
But I will stop by
for a drink later.

294
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:55,762
Dex, you're in?

295
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:57,196
No, I've got the kids
coming into town, so...

296
00:16:57,231 --> 00:17:01,401
It's a family place.
Bring 'em.

297
00:17:01,435 --> 00:17:04,437
Angel...

298
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:08,241
I'm really happy for you.

299
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:12,111
1 cubic yard
of cocoa mulch.

300
00:17:12,145 --> 00:17:14,814
25 pounds of--

301
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:18,050
uh, let me get back to you.

302
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:21,386
Lieutenant.

303
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:24,522
You, uh, in the market
for some orchids?

304
00:17:24,556 --> 00:17:27,792
I'm not buying anything
from you.

305
00:17:27,826 --> 00:17:28,926
Look, I think you have
the wrong idea--

306
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:31,362
Shut up.
I'm not interested in

307
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:35,232
anything you have to say,
'cause you're a fucking liar.

308
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:38,703
I know who you are.
I know what you are.

309
00:17:38,737 --> 00:17:40,037
Well, I think
you'd be surprised

310
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:42,907
at the things that
you don't know about me.

311
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:45,910
Sal Price
shared everything with me.

312
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:47,478
So you may think you're safer
because he's dead,

313
00:17:47,512 --> 00:17:49,780
but actually, it's worse.

314
00:17:49,814 --> 00:17:51,115
He was just a writer.
I'm a cop.

315
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:53,551
Whatever you're hiding,
I'm gonna find out.

316
00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:55,086
Sal Price
was a storyteller.

317
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,387
He wanted to sell books.

318
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:58,122
He didn't care
if they were true or not.

319
00:17:58,156 --> 00:18:00,257
You admitted to him
on tape

320
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:03,060
that you killed
with Wayne.

321
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:05,996
How convenient that he died
before he had a chance

322
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:07,464
to write about it.

323
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:08,732
Lieutenant,
what were you doing

324
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,902
when you were 15 years old?

325
00:18:11,936 --> 00:18:13,370
I'm guessing
you were probably

326
00:18:13,404 --> 00:18:15,439
on a soccer team
or something, right?

327
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:16,607
Me?

328
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:19,910
I was just some dumb farm girl
who was wakened

329
00:18:19,944 --> 00:18:21,611
in the middle of the night
by an older boy

330
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:26,883
that I had a crush on
who said, "let's go on a trip."

331
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:30,453
I was in over my head.

332
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:34,091
You knew exactly
what you were doing then.

333
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,093
You're in over your head now.

334
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:39,596
Well, I don't know why I care
so much about what you think,

335
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,966
but somehow I do,
so, I'm sorry.

336
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,136
You haven't even begun
to be sorry.

337
00:18:55,278 --> 00:18:58,080
I'm not suggesting
a coup here.

338
00:18:58,115 --> 00:19:01,016
More like a realignment.

339
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:04,721
I'd never do anything without
the support of the brotherhood,

340
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:08,124
but I feel like something
has to be done

341
00:19:08,158 --> 00:19:12,495
or this whole thing's
gonna explode in our faces.

342
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:16,900
Okay.

343
00:19:16,935 --> 00:19:19,136
Consider it done.

344
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:39,323
You want to stick around?
Watch your girl?

345
00:19:39,357 --> 00:19:40,491
Drinks on me.

346
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:42,092
I've got a better idea.

347
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:43,594
Why don't you
go fuck yourself?

348
00:19:43,628 --> 00:19:46,030
Ah, come on, Joey.

349
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:48,699
Nah, don't
"come on, Joey" me.

350
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:51,034
We had a deal,
and you fucked me over.

351
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:52,636
So we're done.

352
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,639
Look, I'm sorry I couldn't
get you Nadia's passport.

353
00:19:55,673 --> 00:19:57,674
I tried, man,
but the guys in Kiev,

354
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:59,977
they pull the strings.

355
00:20:00,011 --> 00:20:02,613
What I do have is some cash.

356
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:05,249
If you do
one more job for me,

357
00:20:05,283 --> 00:20:06,817
you can buy something
for Nadia.

358
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:09,720
See, I don't want
your fucking cash.

359
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:11,656
And if you take that
out on her,

360
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,092
I'll have I.C.E. down here
faster than you can count,

361
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:17,162
checking on the immigration
status of all your employees.

362
00:20:17,196 --> 00:20:18,363
So go fuck yourself.

363
00:20:18,398 --> 00:20:20,332
Bye.

364
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:22,334
Miami Metro believes
they know where Isaak is

365
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:24,135
at all times,
but obviously

366
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,172
I can't count on that.

367
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:31,877
Hope he enjoys his last meal.

368
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:34,846
When he gets home to Viktor's
apartment, I'll be waiting.

369
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:40,218
Hey, Jamie.

370
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:41,352
Hey, Dex.

371
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:42,687
We just made
a quick pit stop.

372
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:44,589
I warned Cody
about the Big Gulp,

373
00:20:44,623 --> 00:20:47,759
but we're about
three hours out

374
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:50,128
depending on traffic.
Great.

375
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:52,364
Why don't we meet at
your brother's new restaurant?

376
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:54,933
If he's got macaroni
and cheese, we'll be fine.

377
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:57,569
Apparently that's all
Harrison's willingly consumed

378
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,137
since he got to Orlando.

379
00:20:59,172 --> 00:21:00,505
It is his favorite.

380
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,340
God, Cody, we don't want
to have to stop again.

381
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,842
But I'm thirsty.

382
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:05,377
Can't we just leave
him by the side of the road?

383
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:06,578
No, Astor,

384
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:09,581
we can't just leave him
by the side of the road.

385
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,683
Sounds like you've got
your hands full.

386
00:21:11,718 --> 00:21:14,820
We'll see you
in Miami, Dexter.

387
00:21:14,854 --> 00:21:16,856
Drive safe.

388
00:21:33,908 --> 00:21:36,676
People always say
they'd like to die at home.

389
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,711
I'll leave his body here

390
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:44,116
and let the police blame it
on the Colombians.

391
00:21:53,928 --> 00:21:55,294
Who the hell are you?

392
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:57,497
I'm the building super.
I came to fix the faucet.

393
00:21:57,531 --> 00:22:01,734
I didn't know
anyone was home.

394
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:03,703
You're not the super.

395
00:22:03,738 --> 00:22:06,072
Sure I am.
Who are you?

396
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:08,942
I'm the Avon lady.

397
00:22:08,976 --> 00:22:10,677
Well, that's just silly.

398
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:12,745
You're here for
the same reason I am.

399
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,214
- Which is?
- To kill Sirko.

400
00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:17,417
Look, I don't know
who sent you here,

401
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:19,552
but I'm not going halvsies
with anyone.

402
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:20,554
This is my job.

403
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:36,971
We could have
just gone halvsies.

404
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:41,308
With all
the people who want

405
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:43,144
to kill Isaak,
why is it so hard

406
00:22:43,178 --> 00:22:47,315
to get him dead?

407
00:22:56,892 --> 00:22:58,827
Not this guy.

408
00:23:01,864 --> 00:23:04,866
This one either.

409
00:23:05,935 --> 00:23:08,336
Dexter Morgan.

410
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:10,439
This guy had a slip.

411
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:11,607
Had?

412
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,208
Meaning he doesn't
have one anymore?

413
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:15,410
No. He moved
a few years back.

414
00:23:15,445 --> 00:23:16,645
I remember it
because it was odd.

415
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:19,681
He had, uh, eight months
to go on his lease.

416
00:23:19,716 --> 00:23:22,384
When exactly did he move?

417
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:25,420
May, 2007.

418
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,191
Are you sure?

419
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:33,229
Yeah.

420
00:23:39,102 --> 00:23:41,303
You're getting heavier.
What did they feed you up there?

421
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,471
Mac and cheese.

422
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,773
And more mac and cheese.

423
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,375
You want to go play
on the beach after we eat?

424
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:48,777
Oh, I can take him now.

425
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:51,380
Astor and Cody were fighting
the entire drive down.

426
00:23:51,415 --> 00:23:53,482
I need a break.

427
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:57,319
- Mojitos on the house.
- All right.

428
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,588
For the grown-ups.

429
00:23:59,622 --> 00:24:00,789
Sodas for the kids.

430
00:24:00,823 --> 00:24:03,325
Sorry, I gotta keep
my liquor license.

431
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,060
Everything good here?

432
00:24:05,094 --> 00:24:07,295
It's perfect.
Thanks, Angel.

433
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,967
Perfect because it has
a built-in security system.

434
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:15,170
Dexter, check out
my <i>Angry Birds</i> score.

435
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,571
Dexter doesn't want to see
your <i>Angry Birds</i> score, Cody.

436
00:24:16,606 --> 00:24:19,140
Put it away.

437
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:20,575
I've missed you guys.

438
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,177
We missed you too.

439
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,312
So how's school?

440
00:24:23,346 --> 00:24:25,247
Is math
still kicking your ass?

441
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:26,915
Butt.

442
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:28,083
Kicking your butt.

443
00:24:28,117 --> 00:24:29,251
That's what I said.

444
00:24:29,285 --> 00:24:31,086
Is math still kicking your butt?

445
00:24:31,121 --> 00:24:34,556
I'm a year ahead in math now,
and I'm taking A.P. Bio.

446
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:36,592
Impressive.

447
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:38,961
She passed out when
they dissected the fetal pig.

448
00:24:38,995 --> 00:24:42,498
Can we not talk about
fetal pigs at dinner?

449
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:45,534
God, Cody, can we not
get through one dinner

450
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:48,003
without you doing something
completely disgusting?

451
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:50,305
Can you stop acting
like miss perfect?

452
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,840
You can't even make it
through a weekend

453
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:54,176
without smoking pot.

454
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,211
Oh, my God.
You know how many cops are here?

455
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,479
You want to get arrested?

456
00:24:57,513 --> 00:25:00,482
God, what is wrong
with you?

457
00:25:02,318 --> 00:25:05,287
Guess I should go talk to her.

458
00:25:05,321 --> 00:25:09,357
I'll be your backup.

459
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:17,232
I don't do it
a lot, I swear.

460
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:20,469
Just when I get
really stressed out.

461
00:25:20,503 --> 00:25:22,572
You want to tell me
what's going on?

462
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:23,840
It's just pot.

463
00:25:23,874 --> 00:25:26,943
In some states,
it's not even against the law.

464
00:25:26,977 --> 00:25:30,147
It's always against the law
for someone your age,

465
00:25:30,181 --> 00:25:32,683
which is for your own good,
by the way.

466
00:25:32,717 --> 00:25:34,251
Thanks for the public
service announcement.

467
00:25:34,285 --> 00:25:35,386
Dexter's right.

468
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,620
Sometimes the things
that seem

469
00:25:36,655 --> 00:25:37,855
like a good idea
in the moment

470
00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:41,859
are the things you'll
end up regretting later.

471
00:25:43,162 --> 00:25:46,230
Astor...

472
00:25:46,265 --> 00:25:49,500
I know how...

473
00:25:49,534 --> 00:25:53,404
certain vices can be used
to relieve stress.

474
00:25:56,508 --> 00:26:00,078
But sometimes those vices
can cause more problems

475
00:26:00,112 --> 00:26:02,080
than the original stress.

476
00:26:02,114 --> 00:26:06,651
Okay, I get it, pot is evil.
Are we done?

477
00:26:06,686 --> 00:26:09,688
We...sure, we're done.

478
00:26:25,006 --> 00:26:26,507
Kids are all asleep
in your room.

479
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,909
I put Harrison on your bed.
I hope that's okay.

480
00:26:28,943 --> 00:26:31,512
Yeah, sure.

481
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:33,915
He doesn't wet the bed,
does he?

482
00:26:33,949 --> 00:26:35,049
Not always.

483
00:26:35,084 --> 00:26:37,385
You owe me.

484
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:39,820
Jamie will be here first thing
in the morning.

485
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:42,256
Hey, Dex.

486
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:44,925
Um...

487
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,162
Maybe you were right...

488
00:26:48,196 --> 00:26:50,999
about Hannah.

489
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:52,267
I mean, don't get me wrong.

490
00:26:52,301 --> 00:26:57,372
If anyone deserves
what you do, she does, but...

491
00:26:57,406 --> 00:26:58,640
It must have been hard
to resist,

492
00:26:58,674 --> 00:27:00,375
and I know
you did it for me.

493
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:04,178
So...
thanks for caring.

494
00:27:06,314 --> 00:27:10,317
You don't have to thank me.

495
00:27:13,054 --> 00:27:16,022
Thanks for taking
everyone in.

496
00:27:16,057 --> 00:27:20,160
My home is their home.

497
00:27:20,194 --> 00:27:21,427
My family.

498
00:27:21,462 --> 00:27:23,930
All that's left of it is here,
under one roof.

499
00:27:23,964 --> 00:27:26,299
It should feel like home.

500
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:30,636
So why do I want so badly
to be somewhere else?

501
00:27:39,346 --> 00:27:40,613
Look who's not here again.

502
00:27:40,647 --> 00:27:43,382
Is this a bad time?

503
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:45,251
Fortunately,
you've managed to catch me

504
00:27:45,285 --> 00:27:48,855
in between gentleman callers.

505
00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:50,790
Well, I guess
it's my lucky night.

506
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:52,592
What brings you by?

507
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:55,528
Or is this your version
of a Booty call?

508
00:27:55,563 --> 00:27:57,530
What's a Booty call?

509
00:27:57,564 --> 00:27:59,365
Seriously?

510
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,768
Actually, I just stopped by
because I'm gonna be busy

511
00:28:01,802 --> 00:28:02,969
for the next few days.

512
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:04,571
So you came by to see me

513
00:28:04,605 --> 00:28:06,873
because you can't see me?

514
00:28:06,908 --> 00:28:09,509
Something like that.

515
00:28:09,544 --> 00:28:12,312
So what's got you so busy?

516
00:28:12,347 --> 00:28:17,884
Nothing, I just--uh...

517
00:28:17,918 --> 00:28:20,854
The head of the Koshka
Brotherhood wants to kill me.

518
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:27,861
You're not kidding.

519
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:30,497
Well I don't know what
a Koshka Brotherhood is,

520
00:28:30,531 --> 00:28:31,665
but it sounds bad.

521
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:34,401
It's kind of a...

522
00:28:34,435 --> 00:28:37,838
Ukrainian Mafia.
Wow.

523
00:28:37,872 --> 00:28:40,040
What did you do
to piss them off?

524
00:28:40,074 --> 00:28:42,910
Not them.
Just Isaak Sirko.

525
00:28:42,944 --> 00:28:45,746
He has this personal vendetta
against me.

526
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,915
Why?

527
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,685
I killed
one of his key guys.

528
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:53,554
Oh.
Well, it happens.

529
00:28:54,756 --> 00:28:59,226
So what do you know
about this Isaak Sirko?

530
00:28:59,261 --> 00:29:00,861
I know that he wants
to kill me,

531
00:29:00,896 --> 00:29:02,963
and that I need
to kill him first,

532
00:29:02,998 --> 00:29:06,600
and that it's harder
than I thought it would be.

533
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:10,170
Well, you want my advice?

534
00:29:10,204 --> 00:29:12,405
Uh, sure.

535
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,673
You spent a lot of time

536
00:29:13,707 --> 00:29:17,377
finding out all about me
before you--

537
00:29:17,411 --> 00:29:19,612
Before I tried to kill you.

538
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:21,948
Right.

539
00:29:21,982 --> 00:29:23,082
This is different.

540
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:25,718
I had to make sure
that you fit my code.

541
00:29:25,753 --> 00:29:27,854
I already know Isaak's a killer.

542
00:29:27,888 --> 00:29:29,255
Well, still, it seems like
you have a system,

543
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:31,358
and it's working for you,
right?

544
00:29:31,392 --> 00:29:32,859
Most of the time.

545
00:29:32,894 --> 00:29:35,929
Well, so why don't you try
the same thing on this guy?

546
00:29:35,963 --> 00:29:41,034
Figure out who he is, and why
he really wants to kill you.

547
00:29:41,069 --> 00:29:44,571
Here.

548
00:29:44,605 --> 00:29:47,607
Take my van.
He might know your car.

549
00:29:47,642 --> 00:29:50,544
Besides, it'll give you
a decent excuse to come by

550
00:29:50,578 --> 00:29:54,581
and not see me again.

551
00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:08,962
I have never been able
to talk to anyone

552
00:30:08,997 --> 00:30:13,167
about my kills before.

553
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:15,636
Not like this.

554
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:20,774
No judgment,
no fear, no panic.

555
00:30:20,808 --> 00:30:24,478
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

556
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,948
But I'm kind of tired
of talking.

557
00:30:27,983 --> 00:30:30,317
Maybe I can show you
what a Booty call is.

558
00:30:30,351 --> 00:30:34,054
Mm.

559
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:43,598
Come on, Joey.
It's not that bad.

560
00:30:43,632 --> 00:30:45,834
I only have to work for George
for two more years,

561
00:30:45,868 --> 00:30:47,301
and then I'll have my freedom.

562
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:49,703
You believe that?

563
00:30:49,738 --> 00:30:52,105
He likes his dancers young.

564
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:56,143
There are always more girls
who want to come here.

565
00:30:57,345 --> 00:30:59,813
I'm sorry I let you down.

566
00:30:59,848 --> 00:31:04,385
Just promise me you'll never
do anything for them again.

567
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:08,422
Not even for me.

568
00:31:08,457 --> 00:31:11,159
I promise.

569
00:31:11,193 --> 00:31:14,096
Okay.
I'm gonna take a shower.

570
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,132
Okay.

571
00:31:37,788 --> 00:31:41,791
How'd I know I'd find
your horny ass here?

572
00:31:42,793 --> 00:31:46,596
I got something to show you.

573
00:31:46,631 --> 00:31:48,398
I'm not interested.

574
00:31:48,432 --> 00:31:51,601
Oh, I think you might be.

575
00:31:51,635 --> 00:31:52,769
But Isaak Sirko,

576
00:31:52,803 --> 00:31:54,904
he wants you to lose
the blood evidence

577
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:57,073
linking him
to the Colombian murders.

578
00:31:58,776 --> 00:32:01,511
Let me skip to the good part.

579
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:05,849
If I do this,
Nadia's a free woman.

580
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:09,886
You give me her fucking
passport, understand?

581
00:32:09,921 --> 00:32:12,489
Deal.
And I'll do you one better.

582
00:32:12,523 --> 00:32:14,358
You can even keep the cash.

583
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:17,694
Now do we
understand each other?

584
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:21,264
If I go down,
you're going down with me.

585
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:26,102
It won't exactly ruin
my reputation.

586
00:32:26,137 --> 00:32:28,004
I got the Koshka Brotherhood
behind me.

587
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:30,407
You saw how long
Sirko stayed behind bars.

588
00:32:30,441 --> 00:32:32,242
Who's gonna save your ass?

589
00:32:32,277 --> 00:32:34,778
Miami Metro?

590
00:32:34,813 --> 00:32:35,979
What do you want?

591
00:32:36,013 --> 00:32:39,216
Same kind of shit
you used to do for us.

592
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,517
You know, we have some product
that needs to move.

593
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:43,620
I need a cop around
to make sure nothing goes wrong.

594
00:32:43,655 --> 00:32:45,155
If you help us,
you make some money.

595
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:48,993
And if you don't, that recording
goes on the fucking cloud.

596
00:32:49,027 --> 00:32:51,361
I'm sorry to twist
your arm, buddy,

597
00:32:51,396 --> 00:32:54,465
but you really left me
no choice.

598
00:32:54,499 --> 00:32:55,733
I'll see you tonight.

599
00:33:06,544 --> 00:33:08,478
No one else here.

600
00:33:08,513 --> 00:33:11,782
Not anymore, anyway.

601
00:33:11,816 --> 00:33:13,116
Do you recognize him?

602
00:33:13,151 --> 00:33:14,918
He's one of George's men.

603
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:17,220
Sent here to kill me.

604
00:33:17,254 --> 00:33:19,389
George wouldn't make a move
without getting approval

605
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:22,392
from the boys in Kiev.

606
00:33:22,426 --> 00:33:23,593
So much for brotherhood.

607
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:24,728
This can be fixed.

608
00:33:24,762 --> 00:33:26,763
We can go home, we can call--
no.

609
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:30,133
I'm a dead man there.

610
00:33:30,168 --> 00:33:33,203
You've already gone
above and beyond

611
00:33:33,237 --> 00:33:34,771
the call of duty, Jurg.

612
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,708
Your loyalty
could get you killed.

613
00:33:37,742 --> 00:33:43,180
Where you go, I go.

614
00:33:43,214 --> 00:33:45,515
My offshore accounts
should last some time.

615
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:49,385
But I won't have access
to the corporate accounts.

616
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:51,620
Bloody hell!

617
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,555
Then there's this.

618
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,424
We're gonna need
another place to stay.

619
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:58,660
Who do you think
killed him?

620
00:33:58,695 --> 00:34:02,398
Well that's a job
for the police, isn't it?

621
00:34:02,432 --> 00:34:05,200
Why don't you go and give
our friends downstairs a call.

622
00:34:15,978 --> 00:34:20,114
Looks like
the gang's all here.

623
00:34:22,717 --> 00:34:24,184
So you have no idea

624
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:25,753
what he was doing
in your apartment?

625
00:34:25,787 --> 00:34:27,988
Not a clue.

626
00:34:28,023 --> 00:34:30,357
But I'm sure your trusty
blood spatter analyst

627
00:34:30,392 --> 00:34:31,892
could figure it out.

628
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:34,261
Mr. Sirko,
the gun that we found

629
00:34:34,296 --> 00:34:37,431
would suggest that he came here
to kill someone.

630
00:34:37,465 --> 00:34:39,599
And since you live here,

631
00:34:39,634 --> 00:34:42,702
that someone
may very well be you.

632
00:34:42,737 --> 00:34:44,838
What a frightening thought.

633
00:34:44,872 --> 00:34:47,307
Then perhaps I need
some sort of police escort.

634
00:34:47,341 --> 00:34:50,210
Oh, I already have that.

635
00:34:50,244 --> 00:34:51,478
Well we'll have to confirm
with the M.E.,

636
00:34:51,512 --> 00:34:54,014
but judging by the lividity
and state of rigor,

637
00:34:54,048 --> 00:34:55,882
I'd estimate
the time of death

638
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:57,884
as sometime
yesterday afternoon.

639
00:34:57,919 --> 00:35:02,422
Let me see now,
where was I yesterday afternoon?

640
00:35:02,456 --> 00:35:05,592
Perhaps these kind officers
could refresh my memory.

641
00:35:05,626 --> 00:35:07,727
Unis tailed him all day.

642
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:08,995
He wasn't here.

643
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:11,564
Seems I have an alibi.

644
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,932
I hope they're trustworthy.

645
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:14,567
Dex, what have you got?

646
00:35:14,602 --> 00:35:17,103
Yes, please, Dex,
tell us your theory.

647
00:35:17,138 --> 00:35:19,772
I'm so curious.

648
00:35:19,807 --> 00:35:23,777
Well, judging by the photo
found in the victim's pocket,

649
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:26,513
he way lying in wait
for Mr. Sirko.

650
00:35:26,547 --> 00:35:28,948
Here you go.

651
00:35:28,983 --> 00:35:31,517
These scuff marks indicate
a struggle.

652
00:35:31,552 --> 00:35:34,787
They fell to the floor.

653
00:35:34,821 --> 00:35:38,291
And the killer cut
his carotid artery

654
00:35:38,325 --> 00:35:42,995
with one swipe
of a very sharp knife.

655
00:35:43,029 --> 00:35:44,229
My, my.

656
00:35:44,264 --> 00:35:45,631
You couldn't have described
that better

657
00:35:45,665 --> 00:35:49,135
if you'd been there yourself.

658
00:35:49,169 --> 00:35:51,570
Thanks.

659
00:35:51,605 --> 00:35:53,239
Hey, Vince, I have plans
with the kids today.

660
00:35:53,273 --> 00:35:55,241
You think you can
finish this up?

661
00:35:55,275 --> 00:35:56,909
Fine. But one of these days,
I'm gonna track down

662
00:35:56,943 --> 00:35:59,111
some of my kids so that
I can skip out on work.

663
00:35:59,145 --> 00:36:01,647
Thanks.

664
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:03,515
Vince is gonna take it
from here.

665
00:36:03,549 --> 00:36:05,950
Keep him occupied
as long as you can.

666
00:36:05,985 --> 00:36:07,685
Kill ya later, Isaak.

667
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,087
Yeah!

668
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:11,422
Oh, that's gonna be
really good.

669
00:36:11,457 --> 00:36:14,258
See, get it all up in there.

670
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:15,959
Yeah!

671
00:36:15,994 --> 00:36:18,696
That's a strong castle,
mister.

672
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:22,500
You're doing so good.

673
00:36:22,534 --> 00:36:24,035
Want that?

674
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:26,771
He did it all himself.

675
00:36:26,805 --> 00:36:30,375
- That's pretty awesome.
- Yummy.

676
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:31,542
You know what,
I think you need

677
00:36:31,577 --> 00:36:34,779
a little bit more sunscreen,
Harrison.

678
00:36:34,814 --> 00:36:37,215
Hey, buddy, you know what
this place needs?

679
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:38,783
A moat!

680
00:36:38,817 --> 00:36:42,820
Keep the bad guys out.

681
00:36:46,658 --> 00:36:49,526
Oh.

682
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:53,530
I'll be back in a minute.

683
00:36:53,565 --> 00:36:56,567
Can I have some
of that leg?

684
00:37:05,378 --> 00:37:07,813
I miss the beach.

685
00:37:07,848 --> 00:37:10,216
It reminds me of mom.

686
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,687
Yeah, she used to take
you guys here all the time.

687
00:37:13,721 --> 00:37:15,688
Atlanta doesn't feel
like home,

688
00:37:15,722 --> 00:37:17,056
but here doesn't either.

689
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:21,026
It's like there's no place
I actually belong.

690
00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:24,296
You know what I mean?

691
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:27,333
Actually, yeah, I do.

692
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:31,036
If my grandparents
find out about the pot,

693
00:37:31,071 --> 00:37:33,272
they'll think I'm just turning
into my dad or something.

694
00:37:33,307 --> 00:37:34,941
I feel like they're
just waiting for that

695
00:37:34,975 --> 00:37:37,309
to happen anyways.

696
00:37:40,647 --> 00:37:44,384
You know, when I was younger,
someone told me who I was,

697
00:37:44,418 --> 00:37:49,924
and I pretty much took
his word for it.

698
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:55,429
If I'd taken the time
to decide for myself,

699
00:37:55,463 --> 00:37:57,865
I would have
turned out different.

700
00:37:57,899 --> 00:38:00,134
Different how?

701
00:38:00,168 --> 00:38:04,138
I don't really know,
but I kind of wish I did.

702
00:38:05,974 --> 00:38:09,510
For the record,
you didn't turn out so bad.

703
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:20,322
For the record, the pot
will stay off the record.

704
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,601
Just give me a sec.

705
00:38:35,337 --> 00:38:36,438
Hey, Hannah.

706
00:38:36,472 --> 00:38:39,007
Hey. I'm sorry
to bother you,

707
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:41,509
but I accidentally left
my greenhouse keys in the van.

708
00:38:41,544 --> 00:38:43,878
I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

709
00:38:43,913 --> 00:38:46,348
I could bring them by
in a few hours.

710
00:38:46,382 --> 00:38:50,920
Just tell me where you are
and I'll swing by.

711
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:52,989
Hobie Beach.
Tower one.

712
00:38:53,023 --> 00:38:56,659
Okay, great.
I'll call you when I get there.

713
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:13,808
- Is this the one?
- Yeah, thanks.

714
00:39:13,842 --> 00:39:16,744
So, what are you
doing out here?

715
00:39:16,778 --> 00:39:19,046
Hey, Dexter!

716
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,483
Look!

717
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:24,685
Oh, right.

718
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:25,819
Of course.

719
00:39:25,854 --> 00:39:27,555
I should've seen
that one coming.

720
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:31,125
No, she's not, um--

721
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,960
She's my nanny.

722
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:36,197
Your nanny?

723
00:39:36,231 --> 00:39:40,168
Yeah, that little guy
is my son.

724
00:39:40,202 --> 00:39:43,571
Harrison.
He's three.

725
00:39:43,606 --> 00:39:45,540
I told you about his mother,

726
00:39:45,575 --> 00:39:47,509
how she passed away.

727
00:39:47,543 --> 00:39:50,045
The other two
are Astor and Cody.

728
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,446
They're my stepkids.

729
00:39:51,481 --> 00:39:54,749
They live in Orlando
with their grandparents.

730
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:57,919
Harrison lives with me...

731
00:39:57,954 --> 00:40:01,690
most of the time.

732
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:06,496
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

733
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,531
You didn't trust me,
or you were afraid it would

734
00:40:08,565 --> 00:40:11,501
push me away?

735
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:15,438
Maybe a little of both.

736
00:40:15,473 --> 00:40:19,476
Well I'd love
to meet them sometime.

737
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:22,846
You're lucky, Dexter.

738
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,347
Lucky?

739
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:25,948
No matter where I go,

740
00:40:25,983 --> 00:40:30,220
I'm Hannah McKay,
the spree killer's girlfriend.

741
00:40:30,254 --> 00:40:32,522
Nobody has a clue
who you are.

742
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:38,194
You get to have this
normal life, with kids and...

743
00:40:40,831 --> 00:40:43,932
Is that something you want?

744
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:46,001
It was, once upon a time.

745
00:40:46,035 --> 00:40:48,738
Wayne and I talked about
having ten of them.

746
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:52,208
Can you imagine what a train
wreck that would have been?

747
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:54,010
Then when I
got married to Jake,

748
00:40:54,044 --> 00:40:55,879
I thought, "this is how it's
supposed to be," you know?

749
00:40:55,913 --> 00:40:59,916
But when that whole thing
went to shit,

750
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:04,987
I just figured it wasn't really
in the cards for me.

751
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:07,289
That's what
I used to think too.

752
00:41:07,324 --> 00:41:09,826
Dex! Get over here!

753
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,428
Well, I won't intrude.

754
00:41:12,463 --> 00:41:14,931
Enjoy your time with them.

755
00:41:14,965 --> 00:41:16,733
Okay.

756
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,020
Hey.

757
00:41:36,054 --> 00:41:38,589
Everyone asleep?

758
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:41,325
Yeah, finally.

759
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,227
Dexter, you did not
tell me that bedtime

760
00:41:43,262 --> 00:41:45,696
is, like,
this two hour process.

761
00:41:45,731 --> 00:41:47,097
And that reading
those Dr. Seuss books

762
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:48,866
out loud
is really fucking hard.

763
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,303
Sorry I missed that.

764
00:41:52,338 --> 00:41:54,139
Teenagers are great, though.
You just tell them what to do.

765
00:41:54,173 --> 00:41:56,408
I mean, my house
has never looked so clean.

766
00:41:56,442 --> 00:41:59,544
I love families.

767
00:42:00,746 --> 00:42:03,848
Does Hannah fit into
my family somewhere?

768
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:15,861
What's that doing here?

769
00:42:18,197 --> 00:42:19,797
Oh, I borrowed
a car from a friend

770
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:23,133
so Isaak
wouldn't recognize me.

771
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:27,171
Does that friend
happen to be Hannah McKay?

772
00:42:30,609 --> 00:42:32,576
I was going to--

773
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:35,512
Oh, my God.

774
00:42:40,151 --> 00:42:44,355
Are you fucking her?

775
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:45,689
Deb, I can explain.

776
00:42:45,724 --> 00:42:50,394
I know what fucking is.
No explanation necessary.

777
00:42:50,429 --> 00:42:53,765
Is that why
you wouldn't kill her?

778
00:42:53,799 --> 00:42:56,268
Partially.

779
00:43:00,941 --> 00:43:05,178
I am the biggest asshole
on the planet.

780
00:43:05,212 --> 00:43:07,514
All that bullshit about
you caring about me too much

781
00:43:07,549 --> 00:43:09,049
to let me do something
I would regret?

782
00:43:09,084 --> 00:43:11,118
I fucking bought it.

783
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:14,255
Deb, everything
I said was true.

784
00:43:19,728 --> 00:43:21,896
Okay, yes,
I didn't kill Hannah

785
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,297
because I have feelings
for her,

786
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:24,632
but that doesn't make
what I said to you

787
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:27,601
any less true.
Feelings?

788
00:43:27,636 --> 00:43:30,871
Are you in love with her?

789
00:43:30,906 --> 00:43:33,274
I don't know.

790
00:43:33,308 --> 00:43:36,944
Is it because
she's a serial killer?

791
00:43:36,979 --> 00:43:39,847
Does that turn you on
or something?

792
00:43:39,882 --> 00:43:41,616
What--what do you all do?

793
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:42,650
Do you sit around
and talk about

794
00:43:42,684 --> 00:43:47,288
who you're gonna
take out next?

795
00:43:47,323 --> 00:43:51,159
Oh, my God.

796
00:43:51,193 --> 00:43:54,028
Price?

797
00:43:54,063 --> 00:43:56,397
Did you fucking
help her with Price?

798
00:43:56,432 --> 00:43:57,965
No!

799
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,168
I don't even know
why I fucking ask you, Dexter.

800
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:02,237
Every time I think
I know exactly who you are,

801
00:44:02,271 --> 00:44:04,472
you tell me something worse.

802
00:44:04,506 --> 00:44:06,007
Being with Hannah
is worse than being a killer?

803
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:08,409
Yes!

804
00:44:08,444 --> 00:44:12,447
No. I don't--

805
00:44:15,918 --> 00:44:17,652
I know you're not
gonna stop killing.

806
00:44:17,686 --> 00:44:22,357
I mean, you've made that
very clear.

807
00:44:22,391 --> 00:44:25,326
But you can stop seeing her.

808
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,229
I don't want
to stop seeing her.

809
00:44:28,263 --> 00:44:31,131
Look what happened
to her husband, Dexter.

810
00:44:31,165 --> 00:44:33,767
She doesn't have
the best track record with men.

811
00:44:33,801 --> 00:44:36,569
I don't even want to talk about
the fucking body trail

812
00:44:36,604 --> 00:44:38,605
that you've left
in your love life.

813
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:41,642
I'm not asking
your permission, Deb.

814
00:44:41,676 --> 00:44:44,545
So you don't care
what it does to me?

815
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:46,714
I don't want to hurt you.

816
00:44:46,748 --> 00:44:49,550
Well, guess what?
You did.

817
00:44:49,585 --> 00:44:52,253
You picked the one way
that you could hurt me

818
00:44:52,288 --> 00:44:55,057
worse than you could ever
fucking understand.

819
00:44:55,091 --> 00:44:58,260
Wha

820
00:44:58,294 --> 00:45:00,162
You told me you accepted
me being a killer.

821
00:45:00,196 --> 00:45:01,797
I feel like if you love me,
you'll accept this.

822
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:02,998
If I love you?

823
00:45:03,032 --> 00:45:04,400
<i>If</i> I love you!

824
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:05,801
I went to the church
that night

825
00:45:05,835 --> 00:45:07,036
that you killed
Travis Marshall

826
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:11,040
to tell you that
I'm <i>in</i> love with you!

827
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,850
You're...

828
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,251
In love with me?

829
00:45:22,285 --> 00:45:26,222
Fuck!
Oh, my God.

830
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:31,793
<i>Was.</i>

831
00:45:31,828 --> 00:45:33,895
I don't even know
if I fucking <i>like</i> you.

832
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:36,865
This is--

833
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,868
oh, forget it.

834
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,009
What do you mean
you're in love with me?

835
00:45:53,248 --> 00:45:55,449
I didn't--
I didn't mean to say that.

836
00:45:55,484 --> 00:46:00,054
I don't--

837
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:01,823
I know it's weird,
and it's gross,

838
00:46:01,857 --> 00:46:06,294
and it's fucked up, but--

839
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:10,165
And I know you don't
feel the same.

840
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:13,135
I don't even know
if feel the same.

841
00:46:13,169 --> 00:46:15,404
I mean, it's one thing to be
in love with your brother,

842
00:46:15,438 --> 00:46:17,439
but it is
a whole 'nother level

843
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:18,641
to be in love
with your brother

844
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:21,978
who's a goddamn fucking
serial killer.

845
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,550
You're a serial killer,

846
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:31,788
and I'm more fucked
up than you are!

847
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:46,168
Well, aren't you going
to say anything?

848
00:46:53,242 --> 00:46:55,643
I'm sorry.

849
00:47:02,084 --> 00:47:04,786
I don't know what to say.

850
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:08,823
Oh, God, you never do.

851
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,295
Will you please just go?

852
00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:14,563
I really--
I can't look at you.

853
00:47:29,212 --> 00:47:30,379
What are you gonna do,

854
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,114
just keep following Isaak
around all night?

855
00:47:32,148 --> 00:47:33,749
I can really use
a kill tonight.

856
00:47:33,783 --> 00:47:35,484
After what just happened
with your sister?

857
00:47:35,518 --> 00:47:37,720
She's not--

858
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:40,289
she's not in love with me.
That's insane.

859
00:47:40,323 --> 00:47:41,657
You have to admit,
it explains a lot.

860
00:47:41,691 --> 00:47:43,659
Why she didn't arrest you.

861
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,894
Why she keeps believing
all your lies.

862
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,029
Why she's willing to give up

863
00:47:47,063 --> 00:47:49,365
everything she believes in,
for you.

864
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:50,533
What am I supposed to do?

865
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,869
I can't feel
what Deb wants me to feel.

866
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,704
You don't even know
how she wants you to feel.

867
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:55,972
You just left.

868
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:58,074
She asked me to leave.

869
00:47:58,109 --> 00:48:00,543
Dexter...

870
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:02,312
Calm down.

871
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:05,215
Oh, well, you know
what I do to calm myself.

872
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:14,157
Where is Isaak going?

873
00:48:14,192 --> 00:48:17,194
Looks like a bar.

874
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:25,670
I'll give him half a dose.

875
00:48:25,704 --> 00:48:28,006
I'll walk out the back
so the police don't see me.

876
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,243
I'll look like a friend walking
his drunk buddy to his car.

877
00:48:31,277 --> 00:48:33,745
He could be leading you
into a trap.

878
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:37,583
Not to mention, the police
are only 100 feet away.

879
00:48:48,995 --> 00:48:55,567
? ?

880
00:48:57,837 --> 00:48:59,771
What a pleasant surprise.

881
00:48:59,806 --> 00:49:02,140
We both know
you can't kill me here.

882
00:49:02,175 --> 00:49:04,576
Oh, I can.

883
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:07,245
But I won't.

884
00:49:07,279 --> 00:49:08,946
Has to be some vestige
of civility left,

885
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:10,614
even in this corner
of the world.

886
00:49:10,649 --> 00:49:13,984
You call shooting at me
in a donut shop "civil"?

887
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:15,652
Afraid I was short
on time and opportunity.

888
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:16,820
Barman!

889
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:19,389
Can I have a beer for my friend,
Dexter Morgan.

890
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:22,893
Now we can both relax.

891
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:25,062
Unlike most places
on the planet,

892
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:29,700
everyone's welcome here.

893
00:49:38,644 --> 00:49:40,211
You thought your enemies
wouldn't follow you

894
00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:42,246
into a gay bar?

895
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,517
No.

896
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:49,988
I thought I'd feel comfortable
in a gay bar.

897
00:49:53,226 --> 00:49:55,694
Ironic, isn't it?

898
00:49:55,728 --> 00:49:56,995
I always feared
the brotherhood

899
00:49:57,029 --> 00:49:59,431
would learn my secret
and turn against me.

900
00:49:59,465 --> 00:50:01,499
And now they've turned
against me anyway

901
00:50:01,534 --> 00:50:03,168
and none the wiser about this.

902
00:50:03,202 --> 00:50:04,636
Incidentally,
I will have to thank you

903
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,337
for slitting
that assassin's throat.

904
00:50:06,372 --> 00:50:07,872
You might have saved my life.

905
00:50:07,907 --> 00:50:13,111
But you must explain to me
your aversion to guns sometime.

906
00:50:13,145 --> 00:50:15,413
It's complicated.

907
00:50:15,447 --> 00:50:19,383
I can imagine it is.

908
00:50:21,553 --> 00:50:24,588
You should cut your losses,
Isaak.

909
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:29,259
Go back to Kiev.

910
00:50:29,293 --> 00:50:31,794
There's nothing waiting for me
back in Kiev,

911
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,296
except for a large,
well-staffed house;

912
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:35,498
an attractive secretary

913
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:38,268
who occasionally pretends
we're an item

914
00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:41,271
to keep the rumors
from circulating.

915
00:50:45,176 --> 00:50:47,344
The one thing that made
my life worth living in Kiev,

916
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:51,515
you tossed in the ocean
a few weeks back.

917
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:52,683
You and Viktor were--

918
00:50:52,718 --> 00:50:56,721
Lovers.
More than that.

919
00:50:59,024 --> 00:51:01,726
You--you took from me
the one thing

920
00:51:01,761 --> 00:51:06,498
that money and power
can't bring back.

921
00:51:06,532 --> 00:51:08,733
And now, thanks to you,

922
00:51:08,767 --> 00:51:12,637
most of the luxuries
are gone too.

923
00:51:12,671 --> 00:51:13,872
Not because of me.

924
00:51:13,906 --> 00:51:16,007
Because of this vendetta
you're holding on to.

925
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:20,377
And what did you do to the man
who murdered your spouse?

926
00:51:20,412 --> 00:51:23,047
Nothing you wouldn't
have done.

927
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:28,152
Nothing I wouldn't do
a thousand times over again.

928
00:51:28,187 --> 00:51:29,687
Did it help?

929
00:51:29,722 --> 00:51:33,725
She's still dead.

930
00:51:35,761 --> 00:51:38,229
I can see that Viktor
meant a great deal to you,

931
00:51:38,263 --> 00:51:39,563
but he was a killer,

932
00:51:39,598 --> 00:51:42,300
and he got what he deserved.

933
00:51:42,334 --> 00:51:43,668
My wife was innocent.

934
00:51:45,304 --> 00:51:48,639
And if she weren't,
you'd feel the same.

935
00:51:50,175 --> 00:51:52,710
That's how love is.

936
00:51:52,744 --> 00:51:56,113
It's a powerful weapon.

937
00:51:56,147 --> 00:52:00,117
It can work for us
or against us, can't it?

938
00:52:02,387 --> 00:52:05,389
I don't understand
much about love.

939
00:52:05,424 --> 00:52:08,759
Well, that's because
you're a scientist.

940
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:11,128
Love defies reason.

941
00:52:11,163 --> 00:52:15,066
Nothing defies reason.

942
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:18,536
Logically, Viktor and I
shouldn't have been together.

943
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,972
I mean, aside from
the obvious social stigma,

944
00:52:21,006 --> 00:52:24,508
Viktor was impulsive,
foolhardy even.

945
00:52:24,543 --> 00:52:28,446
Always out to prove something.

946
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,948
I suppose the heart
knows something

947
00:52:30,983 --> 00:52:33,951
that we just don't know.

948
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:40,225
Or maybe the heart
is just wrong.

949
00:52:40,259 --> 00:52:41,893
Oh, I doubt that.

950
00:52:41,927 --> 00:52:44,629
Love can be inconvenient,

951
00:52:44,663 --> 00:52:46,698
perhaps inappropriate.

952
00:52:46,732 --> 00:52:49,534
It can be dangerous.

953
00:52:49,568 --> 00:52:53,805
Make us do things
we wouldn't dream of doing.

954
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:59,544
But wrong?

955
00:52:59,578 --> 00:53:02,514
That just depends on

956
00:53:02,548 --> 00:53:05,384
where we end up,
doesn't it?

957
00:53:10,257 --> 00:53:11,624
We don't have to do this.

958
00:53:11,658 --> 00:53:14,260
I <i>do</i> have to do this.

959
00:53:14,295 --> 00:53:18,097
And then what?

960
00:53:18,131 --> 00:53:19,364
Then?

961
00:53:19,399 --> 00:53:23,035
Well, I hadn't
really thought about it.

962
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:25,437
I suppose I'll take my funds
and find some little attractive

963
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:26,704
corner of the world,

964
00:53:26,739 --> 00:53:32,376
and while away my days
in comfort and anonymity.

965
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,810
Argentina.

966
00:53:33,845 --> 00:53:35,645
Actually, I was
thinking more like Micronesia,

967
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,449
but each to their own.

968
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:43,119
We're outsiders, you and I.

969
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:45,655
On the periphery.

970
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:48,024
Watching everybody else.

971
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:53,596
Pretending we're just like them,
but knowing we're not.

972
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,331
Best we can hope for
is to find a place

973
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:57,533
where we don't
have to pretend.

974
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:04,908
It's a shame, really.

975
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:06,176
Under different circumstances,

976
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:10,347
I think we could have been
great friends.

977
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,162
Till next time.

978
00:54:35,742 --> 00:54:39,578
Everyone wants
an Argentina.

979
00:54:39,613 --> 00:54:43,615
A place where the slate
is wiped clean.

980
00:54:46,218 --> 00:54:49,688
Isaak, I'm at
the airport in Miami.

981
00:54:49,722 --> 00:54:54,292
I'll be home soon.

982
00:54:54,326 --> 00:54:57,795
Isaak, I'm at
the airport in Miami.

983
00:54:57,829 --> 00:55:02,633
I'll be home soon.

984
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:03,767
But the truth is,

985
00:55:03,802 --> 00:55:07,805
Argentina ...
is just Argentina.

986
00:55:22,054 --> 00:55:24,355
No matter where we go,
we take ourselves

987
00:55:24,389 --> 00:55:28,392
and our damage with us.

988
00:55:38,036 --> 00:55:40,104
So is home
the place we run to,

989
00:55:40,138 --> 00:55:44,107
or is it the place
we run from...

990
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:53,315
Only to hide out in places
where we're accepted,

991
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,785
unconditionally.

992
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:59,822
Places that feel
more like home to us...

993
00:56:18,907 --> 00:56:22,540
Because we can finally be
who we are.
