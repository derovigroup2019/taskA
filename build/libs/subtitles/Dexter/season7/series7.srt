00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:51,260
Previously
on <i>Dexter...</i>

5
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:53,529
This blood is
from a defensive wound.

6
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:55,597
So you got arrested,
there'll be a trial,

7
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:57,733
you'll go to prison
for a long time.

8
00:01:57,768 --> 00:01:59,735
Does that mean
this is over?

9
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:01,370
No.

10
00:02:01,404 --> 00:02:03,171
These men
are dangerous.

11
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,040
You should not get involved
with the Koshka brotherhood.

12
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:07,241
Don't be scared.

13
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:09,310
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

14
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:10,544
Where's Nadia?

15
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:12,746
Isaak Sirko wants you
to lose the blood evidence

16
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:14,748
linking him
to the Colombian murders.

17
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:17,451
If I do this,
Nadia is a free woman.

18
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:18,785
Deal.

19
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,520
What was Price
doing here?

20
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:22,923
He heard we dug up
more Wayne Randall victims,

21
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,992
he asked if he could see
the case files.

22
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:26,427
I fudged
the blood report.

23
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:28,195
My guy said
the void pattern on this body

24
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,865
indicates a killer
much smaller than Wayne Randall.

25
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:33,433
Smaller,
like Hannah McKay?

26
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:35,469
And I think
she kept right on killing.

27
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:36,937
If that's true,
we're totally fucked.

28
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:39,072
We gave her immunity.

29
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:41,141
So how'd he die--
your husband?

30
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:43,177
Uh
heart attack.

31
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:45,646
I know she killed
her husband, I can feel it.

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,714
Aconite.

33
00:02:46,748 --> 00:02:48,649
Ingesting it
causes heart attack.

34
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:56,658
Do what you gotta do.

35
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:04,866
Dexter--

36
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:20,449
- chemistry.

37
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:23,652
I've heard
some people have it.

38
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:27,288
An attraction that can't be
quantified or explained.

39
00:03:27,323 --> 00:03:30,625
Is that the reason
behind this...

40
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,260
Loss of control?

41
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:35,062
Maybe the desire
to get Hannah on my table

42
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:39,833
was just a way to deny
the effect she has on me.

43
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:42,035
So now what?

44
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:55,115
How do you like it?

45
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:56,583
Not much.

46
00:03:56,617 --> 00:04:00,787
You do this to all the girls
that you go out with?

47
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:02,289
Wrap them up in plastic?

48
00:04:02,323 --> 00:04:05,192
I don't actually
go out.

49
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:07,494
So then, what?
This whole date thing was just

50
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:10,530
a way to get me alone
so you can kill me?

51
00:04:15,737 --> 00:04:18,105
Why?

52
00:04:19,941 --> 00:04:23,544
It's what I do.

53
00:04:23,578 --> 00:04:26,114
You kill people.

54
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:30,084
Bad people.

55
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:34,555
So you think I'm bad.

56
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,125
You

57
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,761
you fit
the general description.

58
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:42,764
You have no idea.

59
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:09,325
You know, I didn't plan
to spend the whole evening

60
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,628
talking about
Hannah McKay.

61
00:05:11,662 --> 00:05:13,897
Well, what do you want
to talk about?

62
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:16,065
The economy?

63
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,167
I don't know.

64
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:20,203
What kind of music
you like?

65
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,405
Um...

66
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,307
A jailhouse door
slamming shut.

67
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:27,676
That's my idea of music.

68
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:31,380
I don't know
what's driving me crazier,

69
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,482
Hannah McKay getting away
with a shitload of murder,

70
00:05:33,517 --> 00:05:36,152
or you chewing
on that straw.

71
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:38,921
Old habits die hard.

72
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:40,956
You know, it's gonna be
a real downer for your book

73
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,825
if Hannah gets away.

74
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:44,860
Now that you mention it,
people who buy true crime stuff

75
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:48,463
tend to like it
when the bad guy gets caught.

76
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:50,298
Well, maybe I can help you
rewrite the ending.

77
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,633
So now
you're an editor.

78
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:56,271
I'm thinking about
Hannah's husband.

79
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:58,807
40-year-olds don't just
drop dead of a heart attack.

80
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:00,375
Maybe I could
have the body exhumed,

81
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:01,409
and we could test it
for aconite.

82
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,744
It's been ten years.

83
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,714
But if it's there,
the tox screen will find it.

84
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:07,115
And the hard part
is getting permission.

85
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,317
Hannah's
the next of kin,

86
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,118
and I doubt
she's gonna sign off on it.

87
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:11,653
She's not the only
next of kin.

88
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:13,989
Hannah's husband
had a sister.

89
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:15,891
Well, aren't you
a goddamn know-it-all.

90
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:20,095
It's not
my only virtue.

91
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,499
That remains
to be seen.

92
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,239
Thank you
for dinner.

93
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,120
We should
do it again.

94
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,589
Yeah, why not?

95
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:55,865
I'll check my notes
on the sister

96
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:58,902
and get back to you.

97
00:07:19,123 --> 00:07:20,590
Chemistry deals
with the reactions

98
00:07:20,624 --> 00:07:24,161
between elementary
forms of matter.

99
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:27,432
Separate the elements,
and you negate the reaction.

100
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:28,466
This can't happen again.

101
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:29,768
Which part?

102
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:30,903
The horse tranquilizer?

103
00:07:30,937 --> 00:07:31,971
The sex part.

104
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:33,606
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

105
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,074
W

106
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:36,208
why?

107
00:07:36,243 --> 00:07:39,245
We both know
it wouldn't end well.

108
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:42,081
Just tell me something.
What?

109
00:07:42,115 --> 00:07:43,349
You're not gonna
try and kill me again, right?

110
00:07:43,383 --> 00:07:44,817
Because I feel like
I have the right to know.

111
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:47,186
No. If I was, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

112
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:51,591
Let's just think of it
as a misunderstanding.

113
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,060
One way to put it.

114
00:07:55,094 --> 00:07:57,796
You know, you don't really
seem that shaken up.

115
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,032
You know, for someone
who thought she was gonna die.

116
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:02,734
Yeah, you're right,
I suppose I should be

117
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:07,339
a little more
freaked out.

118
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:09,374
Maybe I never
really believed that

119
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:11,376
you were gonna do it.

120
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:21,486
Boy, did he pick
the wrong car.

121
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:39,570
Oh don't, don't.

122
00:08:49,582 --> 00:08:51,283
It was an interesting night.

123
00:08:51,317 --> 00:08:53,852
That's one way
to put it.

124
00:08:57,991 --> 00:08:59,358
You know, you never
really asked me

125
00:08:59,392 --> 00:09:02,027
why I kill people.

126
00:09:03,963 --> 00:09:06,765
I don't need to.

127
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:33,228
Price.

128
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:34,529
The man thrives on stories,

129
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:38,033
and I've just given him
a great twist.

130
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:39,768
If he writes
about Hannah and me

131
00:09:39,803 --> 00:09:41,437
my career is a memory.

132
00:09:41,471 --> 00:09:45,241
Clouds parted,
and much was revealed.

133
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:46,242
And that would be?

134
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:47,377
Now I know
why the blood work

135
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:50,080
on the Wayne Randall spree
was so spotty.

136
00:09:50,115 --> 00:09:51,715
You were
protecting someone.

137
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,883
As far
as Price knows,

138
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:54,885
I'm an innocent lab geek
in over his head.

139
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:57,321
How long have you
been seeing her?

140
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:59,723
What do you want
to keep quiet?

141
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:01,859
It's not in my nature
to keep quiet about anything.

142
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,527
You can't write
about this.

143
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,030
It's nothing personal.
I'm just doing my job.

144
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,131
You'll destroy my job.

145
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,501
Sorry.
No way around that.

146
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:13,105
You could always
go on the record,

147
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:14,473
help me
get my facts straight.

148
00:10:14,507 --> 00:10:19,344
I love writing about crimes
from the inside.

149
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:20,812
What if I give you
something better?

150
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:24,817
What better than "lab tech
seduced by femme fatale?"

151
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:27,253
I was the last one
to speak with Wayne Randall.

152
00:10:27,287 --> 00:10:30,155
I could tell you
what his last words were.

153
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,124
How he really felt
about Hannah.

154
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,625
How do I know
you wouldn't be

155
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,927
making something up
to save your ass?

156
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:37,362
I wouldn't be,

157
00:10:37,397 --> 00:10:38,997
but you'd have to judge
for yourself.

158
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:43,002
Either way,
I'd be on the record.

159
00:10:43,036 --> 00:10:45,204
I'll give it
some thought.

160
00:10:45,238 --> 00:10:48,340
In the meantime, I'll keep quiet
about you and Hannah McKay.

161
00:10:48,374 --> 00:10:51,143
Show of good faith.

162
00:10:51,177 --> 00:10:52,678
Between you and me,

163
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:56,615
I'd watch what I eat
around her.

164
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:59,618
I'll be in touch.

165
00:11:08,828 --> 00:11:12,397
As if I needed another reason
to stay away from Hannah.

166
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:14,733
At least I've bought myself
some time.

167
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:21,139
This a good time?

168
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:24,342
Yes.

169
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:26,377
My theory
on the barrel girl killers

170
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:28,245
went nowhere.

171
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,746
I'm on a dead end
on bay harbor butcher.

172
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,314
- Shit.
- I was thinking

173
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:32,649
we could brainstorm.

174
00:11:32,683 --> 00:11:34,951
I keep wondering
if we haven't missed something.

175
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,587
You know,
some angle, or--

176
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:41,090
- you know, maybe
we haven't missed anything.

177
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,892
- What do you mean?
- I mean, maybe

178
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:44,361
we've been sidetracked

179
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:46,830
by our feelings
about Sergeant Doakes.

180
00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:49,099
I think
we've been objective.

181
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:51,702
Well, I guess I'm just
not sure, you know?

182
00:11:51,736 --> 00:11:53,638
I know what it's like
to hold on

183
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,172
to an idea of someone,
you know?

184
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:57,341
To refuse to believe
that they have a dark side,

185
00:11:57,376 --> 00:12:01,112
but everything we've done,
all the evidence,

186
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:04,282
it still
points to sergeant doakes.

187
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:07,552
At some point,
we have to face facts.

188
00:12:07,586 --> 00:12:10,922
It's possible that we've been
reaching for leads.

189
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:14,292
So should we rethink
what we're doing here?

190
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:17,295
I mean, I just--
I don't know if it's worth it.

191
00:12:19,598 --> 00:12:22,566
Maybe you're right.

192
00:12:33,177 --> 00:12:35,111
I'm fucking
going to hell.

193
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,281
Sal Price made his living
writing about

194
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:41,316
the dark things
people do,

195
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:43,719
but he doesn't seem to have
a dark side of his own.

196
00:12:43,753 --> 00:12:47,656
At least nothing
I can use.

197
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:52,828
You have a minute?

198
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:56,131
Sure.

199
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,133
- What's this?
- It's your blood spatter report

200
00:12:58,167 --> 00:12:59,568
on the Wayne Randall
victims.

201
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:01,236
- What about it?
- Well, there's something weird

202
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,938
I was hoping
you could clear it up.

203
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:04,640
This blood spatter

204
00:13:04,674 --> 00:13:07,576
points to a killer
other than Wayne Randall.

205
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:11,981
Someone smaller.

206
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:13,149
And how'd you
come to that?

207
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:17,019
Sal Price had an outside lab
run an analysis.

208
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:18,287
They found
the discrepancies.

209
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:20,155
Did you miss this?

210
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,057
Price strikes again.

211
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,625
Where will he
show up next?

212
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,661
Deb, I didn't miss
anything.

213
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:27,329
I considered
the same scenario.

214
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:28,898
And?

215
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:30,132
Bl
blood spatter

216
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:32,834
is largely a matter
of interpretation,

217
00:13:32,869 --> 00:13:34,936
but I'm convinced
Wayne was the sole killer.

218
00:13:34,971 --> 00:13:37,572
These blood drops
came from the killer.

219
00:13:37,606 --> 00:13:39,674
You could've tested them
to see if they matched

220
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,343
Wayne Randall's DNA,
just to be sure.

221
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:44,378
I was sure.
I didn't think the test

222
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:45,946
was worth the time
or the money.

223
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:49,149
Especially since the case
had been solved.

224
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:53,320
You wanna just come out
and say what you want to say?

225
00:13:53,355 --> 00:13:54,822
Hannah McKay
killed this woman

226
00:13:54,857 --> 00:13:55,990
and you're covering
for her.

227
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:56,991
Why would I want
to do that?

228
00:13:57,026 --> 00:13:59,027
To save her
for your table.

229
00:14:01,964 --> 00:14:03,131
You're wrong, Deb.

230
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:05,166
If you want,
I'll have the blood tested.

231
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:07,602
Just say the word,
we can spend the money.

232
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:10,338
I'll think about it.

233
00:14:16,845 --> 00:14:19,914
You smell that?

234
00:14:19,948 --> 00:14:21,682
- What?
- Sulfur, mixed with shit.

235
00:14:21,717 --> 00:14:24,485
Means Isaak Sirko's attorney
is on his way.

236
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,620
They want to run
their own analysis

237
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:28,990
on the samples we took
from Mateo's.

238
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:30,425
Hmm.

239
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:32,427
Confirm that it's
his client's blood we found.

240
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:34,095
Masuka's grabbing it now.

241
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,830
I'll have it ready
for them.

242
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:38,766
That evidence should keep Isaak
locked up for a long time.

243
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:40,168
One less killer
to worry about.

244
00:14:40,202 --> 00:14:42,870
I just checked
the freezer.

245
00:14:42,905 --> 00:14:45,106
The evidence on Sirko
is gone.

246
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,742
Or not.

247
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:50,845
How in the hell does the most
crucial piece of evidence

248
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,848
against Isaak Sirko
just disappear

249
00:14:53,882 --> 00:14:55,983
from our own
police station?

250
00:14:56,018 --> 00:14:57,618
I don't know.
I logged the blood samples

251
00:14:57,653 --> 00:14:59,153
into evidence myself.

252
00:14:59,188 --> 00:15:00,554
There's only
one explanation.

253
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:03,123
The Koshka brotherhood
has a mole inside Miami Metro.

254
00:15:03,158 --> 00:15:04,925
A mole?
You read too many spy novels.

255
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,694
Maybe the evidence
just got misplaced.

256
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:08,829
Hey, we do not
misplace evidence.

257
00:15:08,863 --> 00:15:10,230
And who reads anymore?

258
00:15:10,264 --> 00:15:11,898
Simmer down, tiger mom,
nobody's blaming you.

259
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:13,333
Masuka's right.

260
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:15,435
This is why Sirko's attorney
asked for early discovery.

261
00:15:15,469 --> 00:15:17,136
He knew the evidence
would be missing,

262
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,571
we'd be left there
holding our dicks.

263
00:15:18,605 --> 00:15:20,139
We can find out
who's responsible later.

264
00:15:20,174 --> 00:15:21,674
Right now,
we have 24 hours

265
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,977
to find those blood samples,
or to come up with new evidence.

266
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:27,147
And if we don't,
Sirko walks.

267
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:28,815
I'm gonna go
check the evidence room log.

268
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,618
See who's been there
in the last couple of days.

269
00:15:31,652 --> 00:15:33,787
The crime scene at Mateo's
hasn't been released yet.

270
00:15:33,821 --> 00:15:36,590
Maybe we could re-collect
a sample of Sirko's blood.

271
00:15:36,624 --> 00:15:38,291
Fucking haul your ass
over there.

272
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:39,659
Masuka, Quinn,
go with him.

273
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:47,801
We let a fish this big slip
through our net,

274
00:15:47,835 --> 00:15:51,304
I'm gonna be
very unhappy.

275
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:55,442
You and me both.

276
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:57,778
Angel, what's going on
with the restaurant?

277
00:15:57,812 --> 00:15:59,312
I've been approved
to take over the lease,

278
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:02,215
but I still need a few thousand
to keep the place running.

279
00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:03,249
What are you
gonna do?

280
00:16:03,284 --> 00:16:04,283
Turn over
all the cushions,

281
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:05,785
stand in the corner
with a tin cup,

282
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:07,987
I don't know.

283
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:10,657
Ugh. Ugh.

284
00:16:13,027 --> 00:16:14,027
Ugh

285
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:15,328
holy shit.

286
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:16,496
I don't know
about the holy,

287
00:16:16,531 --> 00:16:18,698
but there's no denying
the shit part.

288
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:20,701
Fucking Koshkas.

289
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,169
They fucked up
the sewage line

290
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:24,705
to contaminate
the crime scene.

291
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,342
Which means
Sirko will be free soon.

292
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:29,445
And I'll have to kill him
before he comes after me.

293
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,979
Need any more proof
that there's a mole

294
00:16:31,014 --> 00:16:32,848
in the department?
I hate to ask,

295
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:34,884
but would you guys
take a look around,

296
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:36,218
see if there's any blood
anywhere

297
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:37,853
that's not mixed
with crap?

298
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:39,288
I wouldn't get
my hopes up.

299
00:16:39,322 --> 00:16:41,257
They do not
pay us enough for this.

300
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,059
Quinn,
can I talk to you outside?

301
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:45,194
Yeah, why don't you guys
wait outside

302
00:16:45,228 --> 00:16:47,663
while we're in here
vomiting?

303
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,140
The list of visitors
of the evidence lock-up

304
00:16:57,174 --> 00:16:58,708
in the last 72 hours.

305
00:16:58,743 --> 00:17:00,110
- Your name's on it.
- So?

306
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,445
So what were you
doing in there?

307
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,113
I don't know,
my job, maybe?

308
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,414
I'm a detective,
occasionally I have to go

309
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:05,415
to the evidence lock-up.

310
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:06,650
What was the case?

311
00:17:06,684 --> 00:17:08,918
The Dixon murders.
I gotta testify next week.

312
00:17:08,952 --> 00:17:10,453
Just wanted to make sure
I had my ducks in a row.

313
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,754
What the fuck
you insinuating?

314
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:13,690
You're dating a stripper
that works at a club

315
00:17:13,724 --> 00:17:15,024
that's owned
by the Koshka brotherhood.

316
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,160
So you think I stole evidence
for the Koshkas?

317
00:17:17,194 --> 00:17:18,227
Doesn't look good.

318
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:19,762
Fuck you.

319
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:21,831
Hold on.
You're no choirboy,

320
00:17:21,865 --> 00:17:23,232
but I know
you wouldn't sink that low.

321
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:24,900
Then why the fuck
are we talking about this?

322
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:28,203
Because
I'm doing my job,

323
00:17:28,237 --> 00:17:31,240
and I needed to hear it
from you.

324
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:43,386
No, it looks like
it was deliberate, Deb.

325
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,922
We're not gonna find any
new evidence, at least not here.

326
00:17:45,956 --> 00:17:47,990
We're halfway through another
sweep of the evidence room,

327
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,425
and so far
we've got fucking zip.

328
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,360
I don't think
you're gonna find anything.

329
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:52,961
Neither do I.

330
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:55,564
Dexter, if this case
falls apart and Isaak walks,

331
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:56,965
he could be
on the street tonight.

332
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:58,099
I know.

333
00:17:58,134 --> 00:17:59,801
Just have to
take care of him myself.

334
00:17:59,836 --> 00:18:01,503
Stay the fuck
away from him.

335
00:18:01,537 --> 00:18:04,072
I don't think ignoring Isaak
is the right approach.

336
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:05,573
I'm not gonna ignore him.

337
00:18:05,608 --> 00:18:07,509
I'm gonna put a tail
on him 24/7

338
00:18:07,543 --> 00:18:09,745
until his travel visa
expires.

339
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:11,680
He's not gonna be able
to pick the crust out of his eye

340
00:18:11,714 --> 00:18:12,714
without us
knowing about it.

341
00:18:12,748 --> 00:18:16,451
So don't fucking
do anything.

342
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:19,154
I won't.

343
00:18:19,188 --> 00:18:22,290
Except use the time
to get Sal Price off my back.

344
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:29,363
The address for the sister
of Hannah's late husband.

345
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:33,034
Her name's Lori.

346
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:35,303
Have you ever heard
of this thing called email?

347
00:18:35,337 --> 00:18:37,371
I like interacting
with people face to face.

348
00:18:37,406 --> 00:18:41,308
Especially when their face
looks like yours.

349
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:42,810
You can cancel that shit
right now.

350
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:44,111
You got a problem
with compliments?

351
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:46,380
Yes, I do,
when they're slightly cheesy

352
00:18:46,414 --> 00:18:48,482
and they come
out of the blue, yeah.

353
00:18:48,516 --> 00:18:50,350
I'll try to contact Lori

354
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:52,152
and get permission
for the exhumation.

355
00:18:52,187 --> 00:18:54,288
Can I tag along,
for the interview?

356
00:18:54,322 --> 00:18:55,722
No.

357
00:18:55,757 --> 00:18:56,924
It's gonna be
awkward enough

358
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,393
without some goofy writer
hovering over us.

359
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:01,061
Well then, maybe we can
meet later for drinks

360
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:02,229
and you can fill me in.

361
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:03,698
I did get you the info.

362
00:19:03,732 --> 00:19:04,732
Come on.

363
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:07,735
It'll be
totally off the record.

364
00:19:09,405 --> 00:19:12,374
Fair enough.

365
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:15,009
But I'm buying.

366
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,020
You all right?

367
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:25,922
I'm okay.

368
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,324
I thought I wasn't
going to see you again.

369
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,459
They hurt you?

370
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:30,593
No.

371
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,362
They sent me to their club
in Fort Myers.

372
00:19:32,396 --> 00:19:33,430
I was so scared.

373
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,464
I thought for sure
they were

374
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:35,899
going to send me
back to Kiev.

375
00:19:35,934 --> 00:19:39,403
I'd burn down every one
of their fucking clubs

376
00:19:39,437 --> 00:19:42,940
before I let that happen.

377
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,108
Oh, my God, Joey.

378
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:46,377
Did you promise them something
to keep me here?

379
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:47,845
Don't worry
about it.

380
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:50,515
I warned you
about the Koshkas.

381
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:51,716
I can take care
of myself.

382
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,585
And I can take care
of the both of us.

383
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:55,787
Hmm?
Look at me.

384
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:58,089
Very soon, you're never
gonna have to work

385
00:19:58,124 --> 00:19:59,324
for any of those people
again.

386
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:00,492
I-I don't understand.

387
00:20:00,526 --> 00:20:02,528
What w--
what have you done?

388
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:04,730
You're gonna be free.
Trust me.

389
00:20:15,908 --> 00:20:16,975
Touched you wanted
to be part of

390
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,544
my welcome back committee.

391
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:21,680
More like a parade.

392
00:20:21,714 --> 00:20:22,814
Heat like that's
gotta make

393
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:25,417
a flight home to Kiev
feel pretty good.

394
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:27,452
Not yet, George.

395
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:30,489
Miami is still overcrowded,
by one.

396
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:35,294
So you said this was
about my brother Jake?

397
00:20:35,329 --> 00:20:36,295
Yes.

398
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,431
This may be
a little upsetting,

399
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:42,168
but we need your permission
to exhume his body.

400
00:20:42,202 --> 00:20:45,004
Exhume his body?
Why?

401
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:48,807
Evidence has come to light
that your brother's death

402
00:20:48,842 --> 00:20:50,075
may not have been
an accident.

403
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,144
But Jake died
of a heart attack.

404
00:20:52,178 --> 00:20:54,546
We believe
he may have been poisoned,

405
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:56,281
and that his wife
was responsible.

406
00:20:56,316 --> 00:20:58,116
Oh, my God.

407
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,785
Hannah?
That's what we're thinking.

408
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,088
Did she and your brother
get along?

409
00:21:03,122 --> 00:21:05,623
Yeah, they seemed to have
a great relationship.

410
00:21:05,658 --> 00:21:08,426
Looked like they were
totally in love.

411
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,130
Especially after they found out
she was expecting.

412
00:21:12,164 --> 00:21:13,764
She was pregnant?

413
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,266
Yeah, she told me
in confidence.

414
00:21:15,301 --> 00:21:16,401
I was surprised.

415
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:18,603
I didn't think
Hannah wanted kids.

416
00:21:18,637 --> 00:21:19,604
What happened
to the baby?

417
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:21,873
She lost it.

418
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,608
Right after Jake's death.

419
00:21:23,642 --> 00:21:26,811
It was a miscarriage.

420
00:21:26,846 --> 00:21:30,381
You know, after the funeral,
Hannah cut everyone off.

421
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:33,717
It was like my whole side
of the family never existed.

422
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:35,619
No matter how many times
I reached out,

423
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:38,122
she just
wouldn't reciprocate.

424
00:21:38,156 --> 00:21:40,725
Ms. Kirkwood, I think
we can find out for sure

425
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:43,962
what happened
to your brother.

426
00:21:43,996 --> 00:21:46,865
We just need your help.

427
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,505
That looks heavy.
Need a hand?

428
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:53,973
I need you
out of my life.

429
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:54,974
That can be arranged.

430
00:21:55,008 --> 00:21:56,575
All you have to do
is talk to me.

431
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,910
Well, everything
I have to say to you

432
00:21:57,944 --> 00:21:59,178
can be summed up
in two words--

433
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:00,980
Let me guess--
"fuck off."

434
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:03,015
Glad we got that straight.

435
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,950
I want to write
the authorized biography

436
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:05,984
of Hannah McKay.

437
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:08,186
It'll go
through the roof.

438
00:22:08,221 --> 00:22:10,722
God knows I haven't had
a decent seller in years.

439
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:12,291
I need this, Hannah.
Oh, I'm sorry.

440
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:15,595
I missed the last part over
the sound of my heart breaking.

441
00:22:15,629 --> 00:22:18,365
You don't talk to me,
you'll force me to speculate.

442
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:19,699
Maybe even
get creative.

443
00:22:19,734 --> 00:22:21,868
It takes brains
to be creative.

444
00:22:21,903 --> 00:22:25,172
"Hannah McKay never lost
her taste for killing.

445
00:22:25,206 --> 00:22:28,776
She just updated her technique
from knives to poison."

446
00:22:31,446 --> 00:22:33,414
Just an excerpt
from the preface.

447
00:22:33,448 --> 00:22:36,283
Along with some material
on one Dexter Morgan--

448
00:22:36,317 --> 00:22:38,285
who's a fan of my work,
by the way,

449
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:43,224
and how he manipulated evidence
to help the woman he loved.

450
00:22:43,258 --> 00:22:44,492
I'll deny everything.

451
00:22:44,526 --> 00:22:48,630
Which will be
great publicity.

452
00:22:48,664 --> 00:22:51,233
Okay.

453
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:53,001
Fine, we'll talk.

454
00:22:53,035 --> 00:22:57,172
Just keep Dexter
out of this.

455
00:22:57,207 --> 00:23:00,075
Depends on
what you give me.

456
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:03,111
My house, tomorrow,
4:00 p.m.

457
00:23:15,492 --> 00:23:16,458
Hello?

458
00:23:16,492 --> 00:23:17,759
It's your
favorite author.

459
00:23:17,794 --> 00:23:20,829
Decided to take you up
on your Wayne Randall offer.

460
00:23:20,863 --> 00:23:21,863
You won't be sorry.

461
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:23,031
I'll come
to your place.

462
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:25,734
How's tomorrow night sound?
7:00 p.m.?

463
00:23:25,768 --> 00:23:27,569
7:00 it is.

464
00:23:32,008 --> 00:23:34,175
Price covered a lot of murders
during his career.

465
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:38,947
The bloodier,
the better.

466
00:23:38,981 --> 00:23:41,282
He likes getting at
his cases from the inside.

467
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,488
You can't get more inside
than becoming a suspect.

468
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:52,392
Christy Lawson.

469
00:23:52,427 --> 00:23:53,493
Her killer was never found.

470
00:23:53,528 --> 00:23:55,595
Price wrote a book
about her case.

471
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,632
One of his best sellers.

472
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:02,668
All I need is Price's DNA
to link him to the crime.

473
00:24:12,245 --> 00:24:14,213
You should
throw that away, Dex.

474
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:19,584
Hannah needs to know
what's going on.

475
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:21,786
You're looking for an excuse
to see her.

476
00:24:21,821 --> 00:24:24,822
You could just
pick up the phone.

477
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:34,866
Christ, Joey.

478
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,967
You're here so often,
we gotta get you

479
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:37,035
your own parking spot.

480
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:38,102
I did what you wanted.

481
00:24:38,136 --> 00:24:39,837
The evidence
against Sirko is gone.

482
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:41,105
I want Nadia's passport.

483
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,340
She's done with you,

484
00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:44,142
and your whole
shitty fuckin' organization.

485
00:24:44,176 --> 00:24:46,945
Is she?

486
00:24:50,216 --> 00:24:51,717
Yeah, and so am I.

487
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:53,519
We've been
working so well together.

488
00:24:53,553 --> 00:24:54,687
Why kill a good thing?

489
00:24:54,721 --> 00:24:55,754
Who do you think
you're fucking with?

490
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:57,256
Think I'm some
fuckin' asshole,

491
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,591
one of your
little fuckin' bag men?

492
00:24:58,625 --> 00:24:59,792
- Take it easy.
- You know how badly

493
00:24:59,826 --> 00:25:00,826
I could fuck you up?

494
00:25:00,861 --> 00:25:01,994
It goes two ways,
Detective.

495
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:03,529
You destroyed
police evidence.

496
00:25:03,564 --> 00:25:04,830
That'll get you
thrown off the force.

497
00:25:04,865 --> 00:25:06,766
Hell, you'd probably
do time.

498
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,535
Stay the fuck away
from me.

499
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:10,270
That's not gonna happen,
Joey.

500
00:25:10,304 --> 00:25:12,272
So you think real hard
about your next move,

501
00:25:12,306 --> 00:25:14,708
and what it means
for your future.

502
00:25:14,742 --> 00:25:17,878
And Nadia's.

503
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:40,736
You managed to stay away
from me for one whole day.

504
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,871
What happened
to our plan?

505
00:25:42,905 --> 00:25:43,972
Sal Price happened.

506
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:45,107
Price?

507
00:25:45,141 --> 00:25:47,109
He saw us together
when I dropped you off.

508
00:25:47,143 --> 00:25:50,912
He threatened
to put me in his book.

509
00:25:50,947 --> 00:25:53,582
I can't let that happen.

510
00:25:53,617 --> 00:25:54,750
There's more.

511
00:25:54,785 --> 00:25:56,385
He showed up
at the Flower Mart.

512
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,455
He wants me to go on record
about my time with Wayne,

513
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:03,493
or he'll say
that I'm a murderer.

514
00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:05,461
I'm going to handle
Price.

515
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:08,365
Like
the way you handled me?

516
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:12,335
Not exactly.
I only go after killers.

517
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:13,470
Like me.

518
00:26:13,504 --> 00:26:16,506
It's the code I live by.

519
00:26:18,676 --> 00:26:21,645
Code, huh?

520
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,647
You know, sometimes
life just has to be taken.

521
00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:26,650
There's no need
to dress it up.

522
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:29,386
It's more than that.

523
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,723
I think you're just afraid
to admit that you enjoy killing.

524
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,662
And you don't?

525
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,230
No.

526
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,498
Killing for me is just

527
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,600
surrendering
to nature's way.

528
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,603
Nature adds
and subtracts.

529
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:50,407
Survival of the fittest.

530
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,809
So you're the fittest.

531
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,812
So far.

532
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,917
You ever wonder
what it would be like

533
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,987
if you didn't have
all these rules?

534
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:11,697
Price doesn't have to die.

535
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:14,233
I can get him
to back off for good.

536
00:27:14,267 --> 00:27:15,901
I'm used to dealing
with things on my own.

537
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:17,603
I don't need
somebody to protect me.

538
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:20,506
I know you don't.

539
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,642
But I have this covered.

540
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:28,047
Consider it
a good-bye present.

541
00:27:28,082 --> 00:27:30,316
Okay.

542
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:34,120
Well, I suppose
we're going for a record.

543
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:35,288
A record?

544
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:39,492
How many times we can
say good-bye for good.

545
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:44,030
Goodbye.

546
00:27:57,012 --> 00:27:59,814
She isn't drawn to my darkness
like Lila,

547
00:27:59,848 --> 00:28:01,516
or blind to it
like Rita,

548
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,585
and she doesn't need it
like Lumen.

549
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:06,154
She accepts both sides of me.

550
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:10,059
The whole Dexter.

551
00:28:10,094 --> 00:28:14,030
So why am I walking away
from this?

552
00:28:14,065 --> 00:28:15,598
Because
when some chemicals mix

553
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:18,568
they combust, and explode.

554
00:28:21,338 --> 00:28:23,439
You don't have
to be here.

555
00:28:23,474 --> 00:28:25,175
He's my brother.

556
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:28,678
I understand.

557
00:28:28,712 --> 00:28:31,681
You okay?
Yeah.

558
00:28:41,124 --> 00:28:43,592
What the fuck?

559
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:45,494
There's no tissue.

560
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:46,595
That normal?

561
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,064
It is if the body
wasn't embalmed.

562
00:28:49,098 --> 00:28:50,632
Isn't that
standard procedure?

563
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:52,968
Unless the next of kin
specifies otherwise.

564
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:56,605
Can we do the tests?

565
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:58,106
Not on bones,
Lieutenant.

566
00:28:58,141 --> 00:29:01,143
There's nothing
I can do here.

567
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:07,583
What is it?

568
00:29:07,617 --> 00:29:10,352
Your brother's remains--

569
00:29:13,757 --> 00:29:15,490
he wasn't embalmed.

570
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:16,759
Wha
I don't understand.

571
00:29:16,793 --> 00:29:18,227
We can't run the tests.

572
00:29:18,261 --> 00:29:20,562
So you're saying
this was all for nothing?

573
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:24,199
I'm gonna find out
what happened, Lori.

574
00:29:24,234 --> 00:29:27,703
I'm not gonna give up.

575
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:42,618
I can see
this was a good idea.

576
00:29:42,652 --> 00:29:43,485
You look like

577
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,320
you need a drink.

578
00:29:45,355 --> 00:29:47,256
Yeah, or five.

579
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,490
Excuse me.

580
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:49,491
Bottled brew
for the lady.

581
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:50,626
Uh
actually,

582
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,630
can I get a double scotch,
neat, please?

583
00:29:54,664 --> 00:29:56,031
When do you get
the test results

584
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:57,266
for the exhumation?

585
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,901
We won't.

586
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:00,202
The body was more like
a pile of bones.

587
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:01,203
There was
nothing to test.

588
00:30:01,237 --> 00:30:03,005
Shit.
He wasn't embalmed.

589
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,439
Yeah, and--
big surprise here--

590
00:30:04,474 --> 00:30:05,674
it was all
at the discretion of...

591
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:07,876
Hannah.

592
00:30:07,911 --> 00:30:10,513
Thank you.

593
00:30:15,351 --> 00:30:19,088
That poor woman had to watch
her dead brother be dug up.

594
00:30:19,122 --> 00:30:20,156
And for what?

595
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,058
I put her
through fuckin' hell.

596
00:30:22,092 --> 00:30:23,993
You couldn't anticipate
this.

597
00:30:24,027 --> 00:30:25,227
It's not your fault.
Well, it doesn't make it

598
00:30:25,262 --> 00:30:27,296
any better.

599
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:31,200
Sometimes my job
really fuckin' sucks.

600
00:30:31,234 --> 00:30:32,568
Actually,
it always sucks.

601
00:30:32,602 --> 00:30:33,869
Why do you do it?

602
00:30:33,904 --> 00:30:35,905
'Cause I don't know
how to do fuck-all else.

603
00:30:35,939 --> 00:30:37,207
I'm sure
that's not true.

604
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:39,643
Oh, God, if you are
building up to a compliment

605
00:30:39,677 --> 00:30:41,845
now is really not the time.

606
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:44,347
Look.

607
00:30:44,382 --> 00:30:45,982
I'm gonna interview
Hannah later.

608
00:30:46,017 --> 00:30:47,183
Maybe I can pull something
out of her.

609
00:30:47,218 --> 00:30:48,651
Gross.

610
00:30:50,854 --> 00:30:53,722
Well, you can tell me
how it went over dinner.

611
00:30:53,757 --> 00:30:56,758
I might even let you pay.

612
00:31:01,864 --> 00:31:03,999
Lemonade?

613
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:09,037
I'll pass.

614
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:13,308
Should we get started?

615
00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:17,179
I just want to make sure
that we're clear.

616
00:31:17,213 --> 00:31:20,248
You're going to forget
about Dexter Morgan.

617
00:31:20,283 --> 00:31:21,750
He really got
under your skin, didn't he?

618
00:31:21,784 --> 00:31:23,118
Just tell me
that you understand.

619
00:31:23,152 --> 00:31:25,020
Never heard of him.

620
00:31:30,392 --> 00:31:33,862
We'll start with the couple
from the motel.

621
00:31:49,145 --> 00:31:50,746
I just need
enough of Price's DNA

622
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,781
to plant
at a crime scene.

623
00:31:57,587 --> 00:31:59,455
Traces of blood.

624
00:31:59,489 --> 00:32:02,491
Good for me,
bad for his gums.

625
00:32:33,891 --> 00:32:35,858
The more you linger,
the greater

626
00:32:35,893 --> 00:32:37,427
the chance
of being caught.

627
00:32:37,461 --> 00:32:39,262
Crime scene data,
audio interviews.

628
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:42,699
It's Price's research
on Hannah.

629
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:44,835
If I get rid of it,
it'll cripple his book.

630
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:46,470
Maybe kill it.

631
00:32:46,504 --> 00:32:47,804
You didn't come here
to protect Hannah.

632
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:50,808
You need to think
about yourself right now.

633
00:33:06,757 --> 00:33:09,558
Wayne gave me
the knife

634
00:33:09,593 --> 00:33:13,662
and told me
to guard the woman.

635
00:33:13,697 --> 00:33:17,699
I figured it'd be easy,
seeing as how scared she was.

636
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:21,870
What was Wayne doing?

637
00:33:21,904 --> 00:33:24,606
He started
to stab the husband.

638
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,743
Over and over and over.

639
00:33:28,778 --> 00:33:33,649
The woman was screaming
like crazy.

640
00:33:33,683 --> 00:33:35,250
The man she loved
was getting knifed

641
00:33:35,285 --> 00:33:38,854
in front of her eyes.

642
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:40,789
But he, uh--
he didn't--

643
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:43,358
he didn't give up.

644
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:46,661
He grabbed Wayne
and he pulled him toward him.

645
00:33:46,695 --> 00:33:49,397
And--and then the woman
jumped on Wayne.

646
00:33:49,431 --> 00:33:50,531
The woman
you were guarding.

647
00:33:50,566 --> 00:33:53,567
Yeah, she was just
protecting her husband.

648
00:33:53,602 --> 00:33:55,803
I don't blame her, I--

649
00:33:55,837 --> 00:33:58,805
I would've done
the same thing.

650
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:04,945
Keep going.

651
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:08,381
Wayne was yelling for me
to get her off him, so I--

652
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:11,318
I grabbed her by the hair and
I pulled her to the bed,

653
00:34:11,352 --> 00:34:12,986
and she just--

654
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,655
she just kept screaming,
and s--

655
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,958
and screaming.

656
00:34:17,992 --> 00:34:20,126
So I--

657
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:23,797
I stabbed her.

658
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:26,467
And she just
kept screaming.

659
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:29,469
And there was
so much blood.

660
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:38,043
What did you do?

661
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:43,549
I stabbed her
until the screaming stopped.

662
00:35:00,435 --> 00:35:01,568
Take a second.

663
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:20,253
Looks tasty.

664
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:23,823
Certainly better than the swill
I've choked on of late.

665
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:27,360
Don't worry,
I haven't come down here

666
00:35:27,395 --> 00:35:28,495
to cause you harm.

667
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:30,864
Not yet.

668
00:35:30,898 --> 00:35:32,766
Not with
Miami Metro's finest

669
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,936
shadowing
my every move.

670
00:35:35,971 --> 00:35:37,872
Yes, I certainly hope
they are the finest.

671
00:35:37,906 --> 00:35:39,106
For your sake.

672
00:35:42,877 --> 00:35:44,678
What do you want?

673
00:35:44,712 --> 00:35:46,579
Well, so long as
I'm waiting around to kill you

674
00:35:46,614 --> 00:35:48,582
I thought we might
have a little chat.

675
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:54,688
Mmm.
Good chips.

676
00:35:56,057 --> 00:35:58,558
While I was
incarcerated,

677
00:35:58,593 --> 00:36:03,530
I found myself plagued
with a nagging question.

678
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:05,565
I mean, I will
move heaven and earth

679
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,733
to snuff out your life
because you killed Viktor--

680
00:36:07,768 --> 00:36:12,171
in fact, I was so blinded
by my desire for vengeance

681
00:36:12,205 --> 00:36:16,108
that you were able to lead me
into a trap.

682
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:21,047
A mistake I assure you
won't happen again.

683
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:22,581
We have a cartoon
in America

684
00:36:22,616 --> 00:36:25,384
about a coyote
who chases after a roadrunner.

685
00:36:25,419 --> 00:36:26,519
He keeps thinking that.

686
00:36:26,553 --> 00:36:29,055
He keeps rocket-skating
right off the cliff.

687
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:34,760
You see, I know
what motivates me.

688
00:36:34,795 --> 00:36:36,662
But what I don't know
is what drove you

689
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:37,697
to kill my friend.

690
00:36:37,731 --> 00:36:39,432
I told you.
He killed Mike Anderson.

691
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:41,100
A man you barely knew
for what,

692
00:36:41,135 --> 00:36:43,436
less than
three months?

693
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,537
Oh, it's all
public record.

694
00:36:45,572 --> 00:36:47,774
No.

695
00:36:47,808 --> 00:36:51,444
You didn't kill Viktor
out of vengeance.

696
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:53,980
I have a feeling

697
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:56,750
that you're a different
kind of animal.

698
00:36:56,784 --> 00:36:59,185
The question is...

699
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,654
What kind are you,

700
00:37:00,688 --> 00:37:04,324
Dexter Morgan?

701
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:05,826
The kind who hunted
your friend down

702
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,960
and strapped him
to a board,

703
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:09,897
and put a plastic bag
on his head,

704
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:12,400
and crushed his skull
with a fire extinguisher.

705
00:37:15,671 --> 00:37:17,639
The kind who's going to
do the same thing to you,

706
00:37:17,673 --> 00:37:19,541
give or take
the fire extinguisher.

707
00:37:26,683 --> 00:37:29,685
You're going to regret
sharing that with me.

708
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:39,527
For the chip.

709
00:37:50,373 --> 00:37:51,874
This is
the last load.

710
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:56,279
- Thanks, Jamie.
- Mm-hmm.

711
00:37:57,482 --> 00:37:59,582
You know,
you're an interesting guy.

712
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:10,260
Have a seat.

713
00:38:10,294 --> 00:38:12,863
I should do
my next book on you.

714
00:38:12,897 --> 00:38:14,231
Believe me,

715
00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:15,933
I know a good story
when I hear one.

716
00:38:18,303 --> 00:38:19,603
You know,
as a blood spatter analyst,

717
00:38:19,637 --> 00:38:23,574
I'm kind of
a storyteller myself.

718
00:38:23,608 --> 00:38:24,775
Only difference
between us is

719
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:26,777
your medium's ink,
and mine's blood.

720
00:38:26,811 --> 00:38:27,878
Interesting
observation.

721
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:30,314
Uh, before we
talk about Wayne,

722
00:38:30,348 --> 00:38:33,017
I have a story idea
of my own.

723
00:38:33,051 --> 00:38:34,686
Uh, mostly non-fiction.

724
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,289
I wanted to get
your take.

725
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:39,691
I'm all ears.

726
00:38:39,726 --> 00:38:42,060
So new DNA evidence
pops up

727
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:45,897
in the unsolved murder
of Christy Lawson.

728
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:49,501
You know, the jogger who was
killed near Matheson Park.

729
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,304
It turns out that the DNA

730
00:38:52,338 --> 00:38:54,839
belongs to
a true crime writer.

731
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,508
You said it was
mostly non-fiction.

732
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,043
Sounds like
it's all bullshit.

733
00:38:58,077 --> 00:39:00,980
Well, the anonymous tip
is real enough.

734
00:39:01,014 --> 00:39:03,715
The one that mentions
Sal Price.

735
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,485
It seems he wrote
a very successful book

736
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,020
about the same case.

737
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:10,857
Now it turns out
he was her killer.

738
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:14,828
You have to appreciate
the irony.

739
00:39:14,862 --> 00:39:19,099
How do you plan
to make this happen, exactly?

740
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:20,200
Let's just say
you're gonna need

741
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:23,470
a new electric toothbrush.

742
00:39:23,504 --> 00:39:24,604
You broke
into my apartment?

743
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,873
No, I very carefully
picked your lock.

744
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:28,408
By the way, it's time
to visit the dentist.

745
00:39:28,443 --> 00:39:29,943
You son of a bitch!

746
00:39:29,977 --> 00:39:31,211
Hey, it's nothing
personal.

747
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:32,679
I just can't have you
messing with my life.

748
00:39:32,713 --> 00:39:36,182
Fuck you!

749
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:38,618
You're not gonna
get away with this.

750
00:39:38,652 --> 00:39:40,319
I'm gonna ruin your--

751
00:39:45,058 --> 00:39:47,126
Hannah.

752
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
God, what happened?

753
00:39:48,194 --> 00:39:51,297
Call 911.

754
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,803
911, what is
your emergency?

755
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:01,540
I need an ambulance
at 8240 Palm Terrace.

756
00:40:01,574 --> 00:40:03,142
Apartment 10.

757
00:40:13,154 --> 00:40:15,455
So I came in
to see if Dexter was okay,

758
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:18,091
and I saw that guy
on the floor.

759
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:20,460
Uh, Dexter told me
to call 911,

760
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:21,762
and he started CPR.

761
00:40:21,796 --> 00:40:23,096
Did you hear anything
before the crash?

762
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:25,065
There was some shouting.

763
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:26,099
Kinda like an argument.

764
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:27,234
Dexter's voice?

765
00:40:27,268 --> 00:40:30,104
Mm, I didn't
recognize the voice.

766
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:33,674
I administered CPR
until the paramedics showed up,

767
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:35,443
but he was unresponsive.

768
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:37,311
Okay, Dex.
I think it's all here.

769
00:40:37,346 --> 00:40:42,183
Hey, were you and Price
arguing before he collapsed?

770
00:40:42,217 --> 00:40:43,951
The interview might have
gotten a little heated.

771
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:45,119
How heated?

772
00:40:45,153 --> 00:40:46,720
He accused me

773
00:40:46,755 --> 00:40:49,357
of sloppy work
on the Wayne Randall case.

774
00:40:49,391 --> 00:40:51,859
I might have
raised my voice a little.

775
00:40:51,894 --> 00:40:54,461
That's all.

776
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:56,197
A contusion
to the head.

777
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:57,331
The source
of all the blood.

778
00:40:57,365 --> 00:40:58,966
But that's not enough
to kill a man.

779
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,968
Okay, just wait
for the medical examiner

780
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:03,170
to get here, okay?

781
00:41:19,488 --> 00:41:21,689
Why all the blood, Dex?

782
00:41:21,724 --> 00:41:23,891
His head struck the table
as he fell.

783
00:41:23,926 --> 00:41:26,193
Jesus.

784
00:41:26,228 --> 00:41:28,963
You okay?

785
00:41:28,997 --> 00:41:31,733
No, I'm not okay.

786
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:32,867
I can't even
have a drink with someone

787
00:41:32,902 --> 00:41:33,869
without them dying.

788
00:41:33,903 --> 00:41:36,605
- You had a drink with him?
- Yeah.

789
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:39,007
He was nice, you know?
I liked him.

790
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:41,577
Did Price tell Deb
about me and Hannah?

791
00:41:41,611 --> 00:41:42,678
Doubtful.

792
00:41:42,712 --> 00:41:44,146
Deb would have already
brought it up.

793
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,214
I can't believe--

794
00:41:45,248 --> 00:41:46,281
I'm sorry, Deb.

795
00:41:46,316 --> 00:41:47,850
I wish I could tell you
what happened.

796
00:41:47,884 --> 00:41:48,884
I know what happened.

797
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:51,687
Hannah McKay.

798
00:41:51,722 --> 00:41:53,623
She killed Price.

799
00:41:53,657 --> 00:41:55,591
- What makes you think that?
- He was convinced that

800
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:57,560
she stabbed one of the victims
on the spree.

801
00:41:57,594 --> 00:41:58,661
And that she
kept on killing.

802
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:00,730
Her husband, other people.

803
00:42:00,764 --> 00:42:03,533
All with poison. He was gonna
put it in his book.

804
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:06,002
She poisoned Price.

805
00:42:06,036 --> 00:42:08,971
It's not a coincidence.

806
00:42:09,006 --> 00:42:10,005
How would she
pull that off?

807
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,575
I don't know.

808
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:13,776
But I'm gonna pick her up
for questioning.

809
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:18,414
I'm gonna run a tox screen
on his body.

810
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:20,149
She's not gonna
get away with it.

811
00:42:20,183 --> 00:42:23,185
Not this time.

812
00:42:34,363 --> 00:42:35,797
Hannah must know
that Price's body

813
00:42:35,831 --> 00:42:38,799
will be tested for poison.

814
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:40,801
So why isn't she concerned?

815
00:42:40,835 --> 00:42:43,837
Or is she just that good
at hiding it?

816
00:42:54,582 --> 00:42:56,650
Mrs. McKay,
I'm Lieutenant Morgan.

817
00:42:56,684 --> 00:42:58,385
Do you want anything
before we get started?

818
00:42:58,419 --> 00:42:59,619
A water?
Coffee?

819
00:42:59,653 --> 00:43:02,722
Uh, just want to know
what I'm doing here.

820
00:43:02,757 --> 00:43:04,458
Okay.

821
00:43:04,492 --> 00:43:06,793
Sal Price is dead.

822
00:43:06,827 --> 00:43:07,961
Oh, my God.

823
00:43:07,995 --> 00:43:09,729
She is that good.

824
00:43:09,764 --> 00:43:11,364
Uh, what happened?

825
00:43:11,399 --> 00:43:14,335
I was hoping
you could tell me that.

826
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:16,136
How can I do that?

827
00:43:16,171 --> 00:43:17,505
Ms. McKay,
I was really hoping

828
00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:18,873
that we could
cut through the crap.

829
00:43:18,907 --> 00:43:21,042
Sal Price was
writing a book on you.

830
00:43:21,076 --> 00:43:23,577
You didn't like it,
so you poisoned him.

831
00:43:23,611 --> 00:43:26,546
That's crazy.

832
00:43:26,581 --> 00:43:28,715
You're a killer,
Ms. McKay.

833
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,517
You're a fucking good one,
I'll give you that.

834
00:43:30,552 --> 00:43:32,987
You've gotten away with it
for a long time.

835
00:43:33,021 --> 00:43:35,989
But I have a blood report
on Beverly Grey

836
00:43:36,024 --> 00:43:38,025
that proves she was killed
by a plant

837
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:40,227
that grows
on your property.

838
00:43:40,262 --> 00:43:42,830
And I have a forensics report
on the Wayne Randall bodies

839
00:43:42,864 --> 00:43:45,866
that prove that you stabbed
one of their victims to death.

840
00:43:47,602 --> 00:43:49,970
I'm not even sure
why we're talking about that.

841
00:43:50,004 --> 00:43:52,572
I have immunity
for the Wayne Randall killings.

842
00:43:52,607 --> 00:43:53,840
Right,

843
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:56,543
and the Beverly Grey evidence
is circumstantial.

844
00:43:56,578 --> 00:43:59,145
Unless I can tie it to
the poisons that I'm gonna find

845
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,715
in the tox screen that
I just ordered for Sal Price.

846
00:44:01,749 --> 00:44:05,485
That is gonna nail
your fucking ass to the floor.

847
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:06,886
I didn't do anything
to Sal.

848
00:44:06,921 --> 00:44:08,988
No. He just dropped dead
of a heart attack.

849
00:44:09,023 --> 00:44:10,056
Sometimes
people die.

850
00:44:10,091 --> 00:44:11,558
It doesn't mean
that they were poisoned.

851
00:44:11,592 --> 00:44:14,827
Is that what happened
to your husband?

852
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:16,062
Did he just die?

853
00:44:16,096 --> 00:44:18,798
Along with
your unborn baby?

854
00:44:18,832 --> 00:44:20,099
What the fuck happened,
Ms. McKay?

855
00:44:20,134 --> 00:44:22,168
Was he pressuring you
to have a family?

856
00:44:22,203 --> 00:44:24,404
Was it making you
feel trapped?

857
00:44:26,307 --> 00:44:29,375
She's not acting.

858
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,711
Charge me with something,
or let me go.

859
00:44:31,746 --> 00:44:33,980
I am trying to give you
an opportunity

860
00:44:34,014 --> 00:44:37,350
to come clean
about Sal Price.

861
00:44:37,385 --> 00:44:38,618
You'll be doing yourself
a big favor

862
00:44:38,653 --> 00:44:40,153
when your case
comes to trial.

863
00:44:40,188 --> 00:44:41,521
- Am I done here?
- Yeah. You're done.

864
00:44:41,556 --> 00:44:43,523
Trust me.

865
00:44:46,027 --> 00:44:48,128
You know, my grandma
has this saying.

866
00:44:48,162 --> 00:44:51,432
"Trust those who
seek the truth,

867
00:44:51,466 --> 00:44:54,435
"but doubt those who say
that they have found it."

868
00:44:56,205 --> 00:44:58,373
My grandma
wasn't ever wrong.

869
00:45:12,822 --> 00:45:14,589
Hannah survived
Deb's questioning,

870
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,825
but she might not make it
through mine.

871
00:45:25,701 --> 00:45:27,135
Price was going
to destroy my life.

872
00:45:27,169 --> 00:45:28,336
I had to do something.

873
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:30,338
I told you
I would take care of it.

874
00:45:30,372 --> 00:45:32,606
Well, you weren't exactly
giving me progress reports.

875
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:34,909
I saw a chance
and I took it.

876
00:45:36,979 --> 00:45:38,613
I was doing it
for you too.

877
00:45:38,647 --> 00:45:41,015
For me?
He died in my apartment!

878
00:45:43,018 --> 00:45:45,385
My living room
is a crime scene.

879
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,821
You know who I am, what that
means to someone like me.

880
00:45:47,855 --> 00:45:50,023
I figured it would kick in
while Price was on the road,

881
00:45:50,057 --> 00:45:53,025
a convenient
auto accident.

882
00:45:54,928 --> 00:45:57,396
How'd you do it?

883
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:58,663
Is it really
important?

884
00:45:58,698 --> 00:46:00,232
Is life in prison
important?

885
00:46:00,266 --> 00:46:03,268
I'm never
going to prison.

886
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:08,741
Price liked to chew
on his pens.

887
00:46:08,775 --> 00:46:10,242
The last one had
a little something on it,

888
00:46:10,276 --> 00:46:11,443
completely undetectable.

889
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,478
You better hope so.

890
00:46:12,512 --> 00:46:15,447
I know so.

891
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:18,684
Just wish I could've destroyed
Price's book along with him.

892
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:26,192
Actually,
I took care of Price's book.

893
00:46:26,226 --> 00:46:28,962
You what?

894
00:46:28,996 --> 00:46:31,665
How?

895
00:46:31,699 --> 00:46:34,101
I was at his apartment,

896
00:46:34,135 --> 00:46:35,869
collecting DNA samples

897
00:46:35,904 --> 00:46:40,240
for my now-defunct plan
to get him to shut up,

898
00:46:40,275 --> 00:46:43,277
and I erased
his research on you.

899
00:46:46,381 --> 00:46:47,347
Thanks.

900
00:46:47,382 --> 00:46:51,686
It only took a minute.

901
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,024
I could feel you watching me
while I was being interrogated.

902
00:46:57,327 --> 00:46:59,027
You saw the whole thing,
didn't you?

903
00:46:59,062 --> 00:47:01,863
Is it true
about your husband?

904
00:47:01,897 --> 00:47:04,131
Did you kill him because you
didn't want a family?

905
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:05,332
It was the opposite.

906
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:09,636
I wanted a family,
and he didn't.

907
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:13,206
He threatened to leave me
unless I got an abortion.

908
00:47:16,777 --> 00:47:18,344
What happened
to the baby?

909
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:21,381
It was
a miscarriage.

910
00:47:22,817 --> 00:47:25,785
Sometimes life subtracts.

911
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:30,590
Sometimes it adds.

912
00:47:32,393 --> 00:47:34,428
Do you realize
what happened?

913
00:47:34,462 --> 00:47:37,431
We were looking out
for each other.

914
00:47:39,467 --> 00:47:42,103
That's big
for people like us,

915
00:47:42,137 --> 00:47:44,605
maybe even historic.

916
00:48:34,058 --> 00:48:35,759
What's this?

917
00:48:35,793 --> 00:48:36,793
For your restaurant.

918
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:38,528
- It's 10 grand.
- You know I got

919
00:48:38,563 --> 00:48:40,130
that inheritance
a while back.

920
00:48:40,164 --> 00:48:41,631
I've been looking for
the right place to invest.

921
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:43,132
I can't take this.
What are you, crazy?

922
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:45,034
Why, you too good
for my fucking money?

923
00:48:45,069 --> 00:48:47,036
No, this is
way too generous.

924
00:48:47,071 --> 00:48:48,304
Bullshit.
It's family money.

925
00:48:48,338 --> 00:48:51,106
You're family to me.
Quinn-

926
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,709
Look, you're stuck with it.
I'm not taking it back.

927
00:48:56,145 --> 00:48:59,146
I do expect
a few free meals, though.

928
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:03,884
This is a loan,
you asshole.

929
00:49:03,918 --> 00:49:05,252
I'm gonna pay you back.

930
00:49:05,287 --> 00:49:08,255
Okay, big guy.
We're good.

931
00:49:22,805 --> 00:49:26,675
Report's back
on the tox screen on Sal Price.

932
00:49:26,709 --> 00:49:29,045
This can't be right.

933
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:31,814
M.E. ran it twice.
Negative both times.

934
00:49:36,085 --> 00:49:39,087
That fucking bitch is gonna
get away with it again.

935
00:50:08,887 --> 00:50:10,155
Wayne was yelling

936
00:50:10,189 --> 00:50:11,556
for me
to get her off him,

937
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:14,225
so I grabbed her by the hair
and I pulled her to the bed,

938
00:50:14,259 --> 00:50:20,364
and--and she just--she just
kept screaming and screaming

939
00:50:20,398 --> 00:50:24,435
So I--
I stabbed her,

940
00:50:24,469 --> 00:50:29,407
and she just kept screaming
and there was so much blood.

941
00:50:29,441 --> 00:50:31,275
What did you do?

942
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:35,914
I stabbed her
until the screaming stopped.

943
00:50:46,059 --> 00:50:47,426
Not only
can't I kill her,

944
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,061
I can't seem
to stay away from her.

945
00:50:49,095 --> 00:50:53,999
Even when I'm not with Hannah,
she's there, in my head.

946
00:50:54,033 --> 00:50:55,534
When some elements
come together,

947
00:50:55,568 --> 00:50:58,737
they create a reaction
that can't be reversed.

948
00:50:58,772 --> 00:51:01,206
They transcend
chemistry.

949
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:05,711
Is this
what love feels like?

950
00:51:05,745 --> 00:51:08,714
Is this how it begins?

951
00:51:08,748 --> 00:51:10,516
Am I even capable of this?

952
00:51:19,792 --> 00:51:20,759
Hello?

953
00:51:20,793 --> 00:51:24,195
Hannah McKay
killed Sal Price,

954
00:51:24,229 --> 00:51:27,365
and she's gonna walk.

955
00:51:27,399 --> 00:51:29,734
She's gonna
get away with it,

956
00:51:29,769 --> 00:51:32,770
and we both know
she's gonna kill again.

957
00:51:35,373 --> 00:51:37,975
Deb, can we talk about this
in the morning?

958
00:51:38,009 --> 00:51:42,179
He didn't deserve
to die.

959
00:51:42,213 --> 00:51:45,148
I can't
let this happen.

960
00:51:45,183 --> 00:51:48,152
There has to be
some fucking justice.

961
00:51:51,056 --> 00:51:53,257
It's you, Dex.

962
00:51:54,456 --> 00:51:56,824
Me?

963
00:51:56,924 --> 00:51:59,792
You know
what I'm saying?

964
00:51:59,827 --> 00:52:04,530
She deserves it.

965
00:52:04,565 --> 00:52:06,499
I want you
to make it right.

966
00:52:08,602 --> 00:52:11,604
Do what you do.

967
00:52:14,058 --> 00:52:19,058
