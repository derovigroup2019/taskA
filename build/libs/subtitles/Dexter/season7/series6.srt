5
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:44,997
- Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>
- LaGuerta found a blood slide

6
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:48,133
with Travis Marshall's blood
on it at the fucking church.

7
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:50,803
I talked her into letting me
help with the Bay Harbor Butcher

8
00:01:50,837 --> 00:01:52,638
investigation so I can keep tabs

9
00:01:52,673 --> 00:01:56,576
- on what's happening.
- You what?

10
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,311
That toy isn't bringing back memories

11
00:01:58,345 --> 00:01:59,646
of being scared.

12
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,717
She was straddled by her assailant.

13
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:06,018
Wayne didn't kill that woman.

14
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:08,187
Well, it was someone smaller.

15
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:09,755
Stabbed the woman over and over

16
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,023
until the knife got so bloody

17
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:13,259
her hand slipped along the edge

18
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:16,162
of the sharp blade,
cutting her palm very deeply.

19
00:02:16,197 --> 00:02:19,432
Everything you've said is a lie.

20
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:21,034
That's my story...

21
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:23,937
and I'm sticking to it.

22
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:25,839
Did you get the blood report back?

23
00:02:25,873 --> 00:02:28,608
From the bodies from the dig?

24
00:02:28,643 --> 00:02:30,010
Yeah.

25
00:02:30,044 --> 00:02:33,246
Anything I should know?

26
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:34,514
Nope.

27
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:36,416
Just forget about work.

28
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,218
Joey Quinn.

29
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:39,886
Used to have
an understanding with him.

30
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,854
Leave a bag of cash in his car,

31
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:44,123
and he'd do whatever we asked.

32
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:53,032
He drew his gun as the attacker fired.

33
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:57,937
This blood is from a defensive wound.

34
00:02:57,972 --> 00:03:01,274
So, you got arrested,
there'll be a trial,

35
00:03:01,308 --> 00:03:03,410
you'll go to prison for a long time.

36
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:06,113
Does that mean this is over?

37
00:03:06,147 --> 00:03:07,882
No.

00:03:20,932 --> 00:03:22,799
Hannah McKay.

40
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:25,868
She stabbed a woman five times.
And since I found out,

41
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:28,705
all I can think about is giving
her what she deserves.

42
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,740
Maybe she deserves a little slack.

43
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:33,943
When she killed that woman,
she was only 15.

44
00:03:33,978 --> 00:03:36,078
Scared of Wayne.
On the run.

45
00:03:36,113 --> 00:03:38,047
It could have been
a one-time thing.

46
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,582
I saw the way
she touched her trophies.

47
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:42,651
Nostalgic.

48
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:45,720
And when you like to kill,
you don't just stop.

49
00:03:45,755 --> 00:03:47,589
She must have killed
again since Wayne.

50
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:49,424
You have no evidence to support that.

51
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,627
Her husband died
of a heart attack at 40?

52
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:54,762
Perfect health, no family history.

53
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:56,264
Seems suspicious.

54
00:03:56,298 --> 00:03:58,099
You're really reaching here, Dexter.

55
00:03:58,134 --> 00:04:00,969
I know she killed her husband.
I can feel it.

56
00:04:01,004 --> 00:04:02,971
I just need proof.

57
00:04:03,005 --> 00:04:04,840
Don't you have more pressing concerns?

58
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:06,141
Debra. LaGuerta.

59
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:07,575
Isaak.

60
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,579
Why do you think
I need a kill so badly?

61
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,850
Where do you think you're going?

62
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:18,185
To talk to her.

63
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:19,986
Get her to slip up about her husband.

64
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:21,654
Give me a lead.

65
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:24,290
What makes you think
she'll tell you anything?

66
00:04:24,324 --> 00:04:27,960
Last time you saw her,
you accused her of murder.

67
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:30,029
Good point.

68
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:34,267
I need a peace offering.

69
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:37,103
This is a big opportunity
for the department.

70
00:04:37,137 --> 00:04:38,538
Arresting the head of
the Koshka brotherhood

71
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:39,806
is as good as getting
John fucking Gotti.

72
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,111
Sorry I'm late.

73
00:04:45,145 --> 00:04:46,880
I can't even be late
without making Deb angry.

74
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:48,548
You all did great work.

75
00:04:48,582 --> 00:04:51,051
The arraignment went well,
and Sirko was denied bail.

76
00:04:51,085 --> 00:04:53,186
But he has a small army of lawyers,

77
00:04:53,221 --> 00:04:55,055
and I'm sure they're already
putting his bail up for review.

78
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:57,624
No way he'll get out.
Not on three counts of murder.

79
00:04:57,658 --> 00:04:59,125
Well, I hope you're right.

80
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,994
So do I.
As long as Isaak's behind bars,

81
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:02,228
I'll have time to deal with Hannah.

82
00:05:02,262 --> 00:05:03,663
Of course he's right.

83
00:05:03,697 --> 00:05:05,732
The guy killed
three fucking Colombians.

84
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:07,734
Plus, we have blood evidence
that puts Sirko at the scene.

85
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:10,370
None of that will matter
if his team claims self defense.

86
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:13,006
It's a solid case, Lieutenant.

87
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,741
But we still need to make sure
that the captain is prepared

88
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:16,643
for any questions
the D.A. may ask.

89
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:18,745
Look, we have all seen cases

90
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,680
that we thought were
a sure thing go south.

91
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:22,882
The right lawyers, the right jury,

92
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:24,718
anything can happen.

93
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:29,089
Which is why the D.A. wants
to make sure it doesn't.

94
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:39,867
At least I can make
a peace offering to one woman

95
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:43,771
in my life.

96
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:45,573
If I want Hannah to give
me the time of day,

97
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:47,208
I need to show her I'm not a threat.

98
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:49,944
And how do you intend to do that?

99
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,279
I haven't filled out the blood report

100
00:05:51,313 --> 00:05:52,747
for those bodies we dug up yet.

101
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:55,917
I could fudge it.
Omit some key facts.

102
00:05:55,951 --> 00:05:57,385
Forget to run the blood
on the victim's

103
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,388
dress for Hannah's DNA.

104
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:03,424
The cops think Wayne Randall
killed those people.

105
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:05,260
If I don't tell them otherwise,
they won't know different.

106
00:06:05,294 --> 00:06:07,095
Didn't you promise your sister

107
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,431
you wouldn't take cases
from the police?

108
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:13,468
Hannah has immunity.

109
00:06:13,502 --> 00:06:14,803
Nothing the cops can do.

110
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:17,639
Telling Deb will only make her crazy.

111
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:19,207
And what, you think
you'll just show Hannah

112
00:06:19,242 --> 00:06:20,909
a copy of this report,
and she'll confess?

113
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:24,279
Tell you she killed her husband?

114
00:06:24,313 --> 00:06:27,382
What other choice do I have?

115
00:06:41,797 --> 00:06:47,668
You're blocking my view.

116
00:06:47,703 --> 00:06:49,937
It's a wall.

117
00:06:49,972 --> 00:06:52,407
To you, perhaps.

118
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:54,142
To me it's a blank canvas.

119
00:06:54,176 --> 00:06:55,843
A projection screen for the mind.

120
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:59,614
You killed three
of our boys, smartass.

121
00:06:59,648 --> 00:07:01,082
You're not gonna sound so smart

122
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:06,521
when you're bleeding like a stuck pig.

123
00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:10,792
Right.

124
00:07:13,996 --> 00:07:15,196
You and your Colombian friends
haven't really

125
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:16,798
thought this through.

126
00:07:16,832 --> 00:07:19,200
Now, as a businessman...

127
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:20,668
I've found you have
to weigh short-term gains

128
00:07:20,702 --> 00:07:22,103
against long-term
consequences.

129
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:25,640
True, you and your
men could retaliate.

130
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:27,142
In the short-term,
I'd be dead.

131
00:07:27,176 --> 00:07:29,477
But I'm not the only member
of the Koshkas.

132
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:31,279
I could have 100 men
here within the hour

133
00:07:31,314 --> 00:07:35,217
should anything happen
to me, understand?

134
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:37,553
Yeah.

135
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:39,656
We outnumber you.
We outgun you.

136
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,157
Ah!

137
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:42,558
Quite frankly, we're smarter than you.

138
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:44,460
So I'm afraid,

139
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:47,063
in the long-term,

140
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:48,698
your plan falls a little short.

141
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,566
Aah!

142
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:55,972
Now, the art
of any deal is negotiation.

143
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:59,675
Have we come to terms?

144
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,713
Yeah.

145
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:20,663
Hi, you've reached George Novikov.

146
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:22,198
Leave me a message.

147
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:23,600
George, it's Isaak.

148
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:25,035
I need you to pay me a visit.

149
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:26,871
It's urgent.

150
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,881
Hannah should be on her way back

151
00:08:36,915 --> 00:08:38,716
from the flower mart right about now.

152
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,353
I'll be able to catch
her before I go to work.

153
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:49,293
I've watched her for days.

154
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,630
She never changes her schedule.

155
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,822
Hannah.

156
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:21,826
Great, you're a stalker.

157
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,294
What happened to Peter Cottontail?

158
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,764
Poison.

159
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,733
Rabbits kill my plants,
so...I kill them.

160
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,402
You could just trap them
and let 'em go.

161
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:32,770
When you do that, they come back.

162
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,106
I do what I have to do.

163
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,643
Remind me to never show
up on your property uninvited.

164
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:40,878
Too late.

165
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,215
So you've accused
me of murder, animal cruelty.

166
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:48,486
- Anything else?
- Actually, I came to apologize.

167
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,490
It's a copy of the blood report

168
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,493
from the bodies you helped us find.

169
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:59,797
Wayne Randall's victims.

170
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,599
Wayne's victims, huh?

171
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,234
The blood evidence was inconclusive.

172
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:05,436
I realized it when
I got back to my lab.

173
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,972
I shouldn't have accused you.
I'm really sorry.

174
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:12,076
Thanks.

175
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,547
It takes a real gentleman
to admit when he's wrong.

176
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:21,619
What?

177
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:22,920
You have a little, uh...

178
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,460
dirt.

179
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:29,794
Occupational hazard.

180
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,932
I can get pretty dirty.

181
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,101
Right.

182
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,205
Remember why you're here.
Dead husband.

183
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,108
Since I'm here, I could use
a plant for my apartment.

184
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,043
Really?

185
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:47,346
A plant?

186
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,317
Follow me.

187
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,024
Any idea what you're looking for?

188
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,060
Just a plant.
Something...panty.

189
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,863
You're the expert.

190
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,666
Well, why don't you tell
me about your place?

191
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:09,501
So I can get a better idea.

192
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:12,171
It's, uh, one bedroom,

193
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,006
on the water, lots of sunlight.

194
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,808
You live alone?

195
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,710
Currently, yeah.
You?

196
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:19,813
Currently...yeah.

197
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,581
And before?

198
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:24,384
I was married for a little while.

199
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:28,321
Unfortunately, he passed away.

200
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:30,156
How about this one?

201
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:31,424
If you take good care of it,
it'll last for years.

202
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:32,926
Really?

203
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,829
I always figured once
you took flowers home,

204
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,331
they'd already started to die.

205
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:39,900
That's kind of a morbid outlook.

206
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:42,068
Is it?
Yeah, I guess I'm kind of,

207
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:47,240
maybe, a morbid guy.

208
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,509
So how'd he die, your husband?

209
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,045
Um, heart attack.

210
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,349
But, we really don't need
to talk about it.

211
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:58,051
We can, though, if you want to.

212
00:11:58,086 --> 00:11:59,786
I mean, I understand.
My wife...

213
00:11:59,821 --> 00:12:02,623
died too.

214
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:04,291
Oh, what happened?

215
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:06,360
Eh, she was murdered.

216
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:09,597
Oh, God, that's, uh...
that's awful.

217
00:12:09,631 --> 00:12:12,200
Yeah.

218
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:15,638
Different from
your situation, obviously.

219
00:12:15,672 --> 00:12:17,941
Oh.

220
00:12:17,975 --> 00:12:20,777
All this doom and gloom.

221
00:12:20,812 --> 00:12:23,413
You mind if we change the subject?

222
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:25,749
I do, actually.
But if her husband's off-limits,

223
00:12:25,783 --> 00:12:27,217
I'll have to take another tack.

224
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:29,786
So how long have you had this place?

225
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,654
About a year.

226
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:33,256
Worked for the previous owner
before that.

227
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,557
Beverly Grey.

228
00:12:34,592 --> 00:12:35,959
Amazing woman.

229
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:37,560
I've kept the business exactly
the same

230
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:38,995
as when she ran it.

231
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,797
Same clients, same schedule.

232
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,065
I even kept her handyman on.

233
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:43,500
Where is she now?
Retired?

234
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:45,569
She passed away about a year ago.

235
00:12:45,603 --> 00:12:47,637
That's when I took over.

236
00:12:47,671 --> 00:12:50,140
Huh.
Dead husband, dead mentor.

237
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:51,408
It was actually a really

238
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:53,577
sad time, so I'd--

239
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:55,078
I'd rather not talk about it.

240
00:12:55,113 --> 00:12:57,748
Sorry, I wasn't going
for more doom and gloom.

241
00:12:57,782 --> 00:12:59,883
Seems you have a knack.

242
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:05,623
Well I should get going.
I gotta get to work.

243
00:13:05,657 --> 00:13:10,461
But you still haven't picked a plant.

244
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:12,196
That one.

245
00:13:12,231 --> 00:13:17,636
Pink. Really?

246
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:22,507
What do I owe you?

247
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,677
Consider it a gift.

248
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:27,378
Thanks.

249
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:28,780
See ya around.

250
00:13:28,814 --> 00:13:31,182
Since Hannah stabbed her first victim,

251
00:13:31,217 --> 00:13:33,385
two people close to her have died.

252
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:34,720
Seems I'm not the only one

253
00:13:34,754 --> 00:13:37,356
with a knack for doom and gloom.

254
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:41,660
Beverly Grey.

255
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:45,663
The deceased mentor of Hannah McKay.

256
00:13:45,698 --> 00:13:47,532
I paid a visit to the clerk of county.

257
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:52,003
Beverly's will listed Hannah
as her lone beneficiary.

258
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:53,238
Makes sense.

259
00:13:53,272 --> 00:13:55,474
No children, no immediate family.

260
00:13:55,508 --> 00:14:00,312
Why wouldn't Beverly
leave Hannah her legacy?

261
00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:02,181
But if Hannah were Beverly's
heir apparent,

262
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:07,720
it would give her motive for murder.

263
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:11,657
The question is, is Hannah
responsible for her death?

264
00:14:11,692 --> 00:14:14,560
Cause of death, heart attack.

265
00:14:14,595 --> 00:14:17,230
Just like her husband.
Seems suspicious.

266
00:14:17,264 --> 00:14:18,998
Or not.

267
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:20,767
Heart disease is the leading
cause of death in this country.

268
00:14:22,203 --> 00:14:24,337
Hell, it got me.

269
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:26,005
What about poison?

270
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,675
That's the way women usually kill.

271
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:31,211
Safe. Detached.

272
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,580
She poisons rabbits, Dexter.

273
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:35,882
It doesn't mean she poisons people.

274
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:39,886
Why are you so convinced
she's still a killer?

275
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:48,529
I know that face.

276
00:14:48,563 --> 00:14:50,631
Sal Price.

277
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:52,132
Maybe he can tell
me something about Hannah

278
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,634
I don't already know.

279
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:03,444
Hey, was that Sal Pice?

280
00:15:03,478 --> 00:15:04,712
Yeah.
What do you care?

281
00:15:04,746 --> 00:15:05,946
I read his book.
I'm a fan.

282
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:07,815
Since when do you read true crime?

283
00:15:07,849 --> 00:15:09,483
Since we started working
on the Wayne Randall case.

284
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:11,718
Guess I'm learning all kinds
of new things about you.

285
00:15:11,753 --> 00:15:14,054
What was Price doing here?

286
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:16,423
He heard we dug
up more Wayne Randall victims.

287
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,125
He wants to update
and reissue his book.

288
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,559
He asked if he could see
the case files.

289
00:15:19,594 --> 00:15:21,762
- I said I'd have copies made.
- Shit.

290
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,496
The case is closed.
What's the big deal?

291
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:26,666
I fudged the blood report,
for starters.

292
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,567
No, it's just--
Was he leaving?

293
00:15:28,602 --> 00:15:29,835
I want to ask him to sign my book.

294
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,237
He went down to the coffee truck

295
00:15:31,271 --> 00:15:32,671
while I'm having the copies made.

296
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:37,877
I'm sure he'd love to.

297
00:15:40,381 --> 00:15:42,248
- Coffee.
- Mr. Price?

298
00:15:42,283 --> 00:15:43,750
Hi. Dexter Morgan.

299
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:46,353
I'm a big fan.

300
00:15:46,387 --> 00:15:48,855
I was hoping maybe
I could get an autograph?

301
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,190
Yeah, sure.

302
00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:51,958
Of course.

303
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,860
Morgan.

304
00:15:53,894 --> 00:15:56,462
Any relation to the Lieutenant?

305
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,364
Yeah, she's my sister.
She says you're writing

306
00:15:58,398 --> 00:16:01,467
an update on the new bodies.
That's exciting.

307
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:03,636
Is she single?

308
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,305
Yeah, last time I checked.

309
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,840
Look, I should warn you.

310
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:09,942
Since we're talking
about a solved crime,

311
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:11,944
I didn't really put that much
time into my blood report.

312
00:16:11,978 --> 00:16:14,613
That's okay, I usually have
my own guy take a look.

313
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:15,947
Just in case.

314
00:16:15,982 --> 00:16:18,650
What are you hoping to find?

315
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:20,052
Let's just say, I have a little theory

316
00:16:20,086 --> 00:16:22,955
that Hannah McKay deserves
her own sequel.

317
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:25,224
So does your sister date, or--

318
00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:27,559
You're writing
a book about Hannah McKay?

319
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:30,162
What are the highlights?

320
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:32,465
Come on, give me something.
Just a teaser,

321
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:36,134
for a fan.

322
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:38,971
Only if you put in a good word
for me with your sister.

323
00:16:39,005 --> 00:16:41,039
Sure.

324
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:43,375
So, Hannah McKay?

325
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:46,011
Right, so, get this.

326
00:16:46,045 --> 00:16:48,547
Right out of juvie, Hannah moves
into a halfway house.

327
00:16:48,581 --> 00:16:50,248
Seems like all's going well,

328
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:54,186
until she accuses some counselor
of abusing her, sexually.

329
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,754
So what happened?

330
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:57,256
Nothing.
Guy gets a slap on the wrist.

331
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,590
But, a couple of weeks later,

332
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,359
he drops dead.

333
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:01,727
Rat poisoning.

334
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:04,930
Sound like a coincidence to you?

335
00:17:04,964 --> 00:17:06,598
Wow, I don't know.

336
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:08,700
Three makes a pattern.
Maybe they all got in her way.

337
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:10,769
Well, that's all
you're getting out of me.

338
00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:12,337
You want the rest, read the book.

339
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,907
I'm gonna go check on those files.

340
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:20,946
Pleasure to meet you, Dexter Morgan.

341
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,381
I will read your book,
Mr. Price.

342
00:17:23,415 --> 00:17:26,752
But I won't be waiting for
it to come out in hard copy.

343
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:29,020
You are now officially
my favorite lieutenant.

344
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:31,423
Can I buy you an adult beverage
as a token of my appreciation?

345
00:17:31,457 --> 00:17:33,592
Some place dark and not too loud?

346
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:36,128
- That sounds like a date.
- Not to me.

347
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:38,296
It sounds like a beautiful
police lieutenant

348
00:17:38,331 --> 00:17:41,266
sharing an evening
with a handsome crime writer.

349
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,569
Can I take a rain check?

350
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:45,571
- Sorry.
- Don't be. I get it.

351
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:47,306
Me coming in here, asking you out.

352
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,109
You probably think I'm trying
to write your story.

353
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:51,977
- Which, I'm not, by the way.
- My story?

354
00:17:52,012 --> 00:17:53,779
You know, being engaged
to the Ice Truck Killer.

355
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:55,280
- I'm sure you got the bejesus--
- Shit, that hadn't even

356
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:57,049
occurred to me.
Is that what you're doing?

357
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,284
- I just said I wasn't.
- Well how do I know that's not

358
00:17:58,318 --> 00:17:59,552
some fucked up tactic?

359
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:03,722
Are you always this defensive?

360
00:18:03,757 --> 00:18:04,957
Sorry, I didn't--

361
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:06,826
I didn't mean to be defensive.

362
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,261
I'm just not really in a dating mode.

363
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,731
Dating mode. Wow.
That's a thing.

364
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:15,001
My life is really fucking complicated.

365
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:17,136
Fine, but, for the record...

366
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:18,972
I like complicated.

367
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:22,909
So if you happen
to change your mind...

368
00:18:22,943 --> 00:18:28,047
give me a call.

369
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,927
Oh, sorry, had garlic for lunch.

370
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:45,531
You have gum in here, yes?

371
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:46,865
What is that?

372
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,600
George left it in my car

373
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:50,535
the last time I was at the club.

374
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,337
Figured you knew about it.

375
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:56,841
Why would he do that?

376
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:58,376
He used to give me cash
to look the other way

377
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,511
back when I worked Narcotics.

378
00:19:03,482 --> 00:19:06,050
I thought you were joking when
you said you were a dirty cop.

379
00:19:06,085 --> 00:19:07,385
I was joking.

380
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:09,821
I'm a good cop.

381
00:19:09,855 --> 00:19:11,055
I also like money.

382
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,723
Joey.

383
00:19:12,758 --> 00:19:15,459
I know.

384
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:16,727
When I took it, I figured George

385
00:19:16,762 --> 00:19:18,162
was gonna ask me for something small,

386
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:20,331
but now that Isaak's been arrested

387
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:21,866
I'm not sure I want to do

388
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,469
whatever it is they're gonna
ask me to do.

389
00:19:24,504 --> 00:19:26,205
You're sure you didn't
know about this?

390
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:31,076
If I did, I would have told
you to give it back.

391
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:32,545
You're giving this back, right?

392
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:33,979
I'm thinking about it.

393
00:19:34,014 --> 00:19:35,881
Joey, these are dangerous people

394
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,150
you know, there's like
10 grand in that bag.

395
00:19:38,184 --> 00:19:41,720
What good is money if you're dead?

396
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:54,768
? ?

397
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:58,339
I'm not for sale.

398
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:00,908
Take care of yourself.

399
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:14,121
Price is going through my
evidence at the police station.

400
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:19,193
Turn around is fair play.

401
00:20:26,168 --> 00:20:28,068
Hopefully his thoughts about Hannah

402
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:33,107
are a little more organized.

403
00:20:40,682 --> 00:20:41,916
Looks like Price and I

404
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,918
share an obsession.

405
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:48,489
But he's had years
to follow Hannah's every move.

406
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:52,393
I need to catch up.

407
00:21:01,437 --> 00:21:04,072
Price's source material.

408
00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:07,175
I'll have to come back
to see what he has on me.

409
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:11,846
Right now,
I have to get in and get out.

410
00:21:14,717 --> 00:21:17,118
A blood test for Hannah's mentor
Beverly Grey.

411
00:21:19,722 --> 00:21:22,491
Whatever it means,
I'll bet Price wrote about it.

412
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,812
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm fine, come on.

413
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,046
So have you heard from Louis?

414
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:47,282
No. Thank God.

415
00:21:49,885 --> 00:21:53,054
I mean, hookers?
Gross.

416
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:55,957
Who does that?

417
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:58,225
Yeah.

418
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,960
Gross.

419
00:21:59,995 --> 00:22:04,298
So what do you think of this place?

420
00:22:04,332 --> 00:22:05,899
I guess it's cute.

421
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:07,501
Kind of a dive.

422
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,470
Because the owner's thinking
about selling...

423
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:12,473
and I'm thinking about buying.

424
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:14,708
Angel, how are you gonna find
the time to run a restaurant

425
00:22:14,742 --> 00:22:16,243
with all the hours you put
in at the station?

426
00:22:16,277 --> 00:22:18,412
I could just retire.

427
00:22:18,446 --> 00:22:20,247
I've put in my 20 years.

428
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:22,249
So you're just gonna quit?

429
00:22:22,283 --> 00:22:24,051
- Retire.
- Do something else?

430
00:22:24,085 --> 00:22:26,753
- Yeah.
- Look, Angel...

431
00:22:26,788 --> 00:22:30,557
you're my brother, and I love you.

432
00:22:30,591 --> 00:22:34,094
But this is a big decision.

433
00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:35,361
And we both know you're impulsive.

434
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:36,663
You get these crazy ideas,

435
00:22:36,697 --> 00:22:37,897
like you want
to buy a racetrack--

436
00:22:37,932 --> 00:22:39,265
I don't get these crazy--

437
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:40,599
You do, and then
you end up divorced...

438
00:22:40,634 --> 00:22:42,868
- Shh.
- With a broken down Trans Am,

439
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:48,708
and barely enough money
to pay the rent.

440
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,020
I see you brought Jurg.

441
00:22:59,054 --> 00:23:01,690
So good to see you both getting
on in my absence.

442
00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:03,791
What, are you kidding?
Since you've been arrested,

443
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:06,594
I can't take a shit without
lurch breathing down my neck.

444
00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:12,601
Well someone has to keep
an eye on you while I'm in here.

445
00:23:12,635 --> 00:23:14,436
So what's the big emergency?

446
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:16,305
You need to get me out of here,

447
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:17,907
as soon as humanly possible.

448
00:23:17,941 --> 00:23:19,542
What happened?

449
00:23:19,576 --> 00:23:20,776
Nothing.

450
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:22,911
Yet.

451
00:23:22,946 --> 00:23:27,316
But I'd really like
to avoid killing anyone in here.

452
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:32,221
It would get in the way
of my being released.

453
00:23:32,255 --> 00:23:36,459
Have you heard from Detective Quinn?

454
00:23:36,493 --> 00:23:41,231
He, um...
He gave back the money.

455
00:23:41,265 --> 00:23:42,899
Which is weird, because

456
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:46,469
he's never turned down a payoff before.

457
00:23:48,939 --> 00:23:52,175
George...

458
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:55,445
do not disappoint me.

459
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:17,669
Hi.

460
00:24:17,703 --> 00:24:19,838
Quinn.
Reservation for two.

461
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:21,372
Your other party has already arrived.

462
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:23,541
Right this way, Mr. Quinn.

463
00:24:33,353 --> 00:24:38,490
Enjoy your dinner.

464
00:24:38,524 --> 00:24:40,158
What the fuck is this?

465
00:24:40,193 --> 00:24:43,728
Where's Nadia?

466
00:24:43,763 --> 00:24:46,464
If you hurt her, I will put a bullet

467
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:48,333
through your motherfucking head.

468
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:52,170
Easy, detective.
Don't make a scene.

469
00:24:52,204 --> 00:24:54,839
Nadia is a valuable commodity.

470
00:24:54,874 --> 00:24:59,911
We wouldn't do that.
Not unless we had to.

471
00:25:08,487 --> 00:25:09,821
What do you want from me?

472
00:25:09,856 --> 00:25:11,490
I don't want shit.

473
00:25:11,524 --> 00:25:13,058
But Isaak Sirko,

474
00:25:13,092 --> 00:25:14,426
he wants you
to lose the blood evidence

475
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,827
linking him to the Colombian murders.

476
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:18,096
Why the fuck would I do that for you?

477
00:25:18,131 --> 00:25:19,498
Well, you took our money for starters.

478
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:20,899
And I gave it back.

479
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:22,167
I don't owe you shit.

480
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:24,436
Not the way Isaak sees it.

481
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,105
Now, he did you a favor by taking out

482
00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:27,940
those Colombian scumbags.

483
00:25:27,974 --> 00:25:29,208
As soon as you let him go,

484
00:25:29,242 --> 00:25:30,509
he'll head back to the Ukraine.

485
00:25:30,544 --> 00:25:32,411
You'll never hear from him again.

486
00:25:32,445 --> 00:25:33,646
It's not that big a deal.

487
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,180
Then find someone else.

488
00:25:35,215 --> 00:25:38,917
Now why would we do that
when we have you?

489
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:42,421
Joey, come on.

490
00:25:42,455 --> 00:25:45,457
You know we got you.

491
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,763
What happens if I don't cooperate?

492
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:53,331
I'm thinking of transferring Nadia

493
00:25:53,366 --> 00:25:56,434
to one of our sex clubs in Dubai.

494
00:25:56,468 --> 00:25:58,603
But she's a strong girl.

495
00:25:58,637 --> 00:26:04,408
She'll last a couple weeks
before she slits her wrists.

496
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:07,712
If I do this...

497
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:10,547
Nadia's a free woman.

498
00:26:10,582 --> 00:26:13,217
You give me her fucking
passport, understand?

499
00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:15,886
Deal.

500
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:17,121
And I'll do you one better.

501
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:21,125
You can even keep the cash.

502
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,897
See, Joe?

503
00:26:25,931 --> 00:26:30,402
Just like old times.

504
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:47,787
- It's Nadia.
- Leave a message.

505
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:53,025
Nadia, it's Joey.
Call me as soon as you get this.

506
00:26:57,531 --> 00:27:02,803
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

507
00:27:02,837 --> 00:27:04,237
How was the meeting
with the D.A.?

508
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:05,738
Uh, fine.

509
00:27:05,773 --> 00:27:07,240
He's confident that
we have enough evidence

510
00:27:07,274 --> 00:27:08,775
to put Sirko away for a long time.

511
00:27:10,144 --> 00:27:13,012
Thank the sweet fucking baby Jesus.

512
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:17,517
But that's not what
I wanted to talk to you about.

513
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:20,687
I had my last
two interviews yesterday.

514
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:22,355
You know, with the families
of the missing persons

515
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:23,623
who I thought could have been victims

516
00:27:23,657 --> 00:27:25,758
of the Bay Harbor Butcher?

517
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:27,126
And? Any leads?

518
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,794
Not a one.

519
00:27:28,828 --> 00:27:32,030
It's frustrating.

520
00:27:32,064 --> 00:27:34,365
So I started looking into open cases.

521
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,604
I figure, a lot of homicide
suspects vanish into thin air.

522
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:43,608
What if the Butcher
took some of them out?

523
00:27:43,642 --> 00:27:45,977
That's good thinking.

524
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:47,211
Did you find anything?

525
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:49,946
Maybe.

526
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:52,783
- Remember the barrel girls?
- A swamp full

527
00:27:52,817 --> 00:27:55,485
of blondes in barrels, all of them...

528
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,454
raped, electrocuted, and embalmed?

529
00:27:57,488 --> 00:27:59,555
Yeah, how could I forget it?

530
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,358
All five suspects,
including self-help guru

531
00:28:02,392 --> 00:28:04,894
Jordan Chase, went missing

532
00:28:04,928 --> 00:28:06,796
before we could build
a case against them.

533
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:10,466
You're thinking the Butcher
could have killed them.

534
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,335
There were two vigilante killers.

535
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:14,870
Maybe he took on an accomplice.

536
00:28:14,905 --> 00:28:18,174
One of the victims
who was looking for justice?

537
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:20,142
I'm--

538
00:28:20,177 --> 00:28:24,380
I know it's a reach.

539
00:28:24,414 --> 00:28:28,084
But it's possible.

540
00:28:28,118 --> 00:28:31,320
Wasn't the theory that Jordan
Chase killed the accomplices,

541
00:28:31,355 --> 00:28:33,656
- then fled the country?
- Yes, but even

542
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:37,192
if Chase killed
the other four suspects,

543
00:28:37,227 --> 00:28:41,097
the Butcher still could
have killed Chase.

544
00:28:47,872 --> 00:28:49,339
I don't think so.

545
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,343
Jordan Chase was very high profile.

546
00:28:53,377 --> 00:28:56,780
It would be too risky.

547
00:28:56,814 --> 00:28:59,949
Still...

548
00:28:59,984 --> 00:29:02,985
it's worth looking into.

549
00:29:19,737 --> 00:29:21,270
Find what you're looking for?

550
00:29:21,305 --> 00:29:22,738
It says here Price

551
00:29:22,773 --> 00:29:25,474
bribed the funeral director
to get access

552
00:29:25,508 --> 00:29:27,976
to Beverly Grey's body before
she was cremated.

553
00:29:28,011 --> 00:29:29,978
He stole a blood sample,

554
00:29:30,012 --> 00:29:33,315
and ran it for aconite.

555
00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:34,816
Aconite?

556
00:29:34,851 --> 00:29:39,220
The queen of all poisons.

557
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:41,389
Ingesting it causes a heart attack.

558
00:29:41,423 --> 00:29:43,725
Price says it's been growing on

559
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,893
the greenhouse property for years.

560
00:29:45,928 --> 00:29:47,161
Poison.

561
00:29:47,196 --> 00:29:49,063
You were right.

562
00:29:49,098 --> 00:29:50,298
It didn't show up on the autopsy?

563
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,967
It wouldn't have.

564
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:53,836
Not if they didn't know
what they were looking for.

565
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,574
Her blood test.

566
00:29:58,609 --> 00:30:00,343
Positive for aconite.

567
00:30:00,377 --> 00:30:02,245
Proof that Beverly was poisoned.

568
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,448
But not proof that Hannah
did the poisoning.

569
00:30:05,483 --> 00:30:07,684
Hannah said her handyman was there

570
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:09,119
when Beverly was still alive.

571
00:30:09,153 --> 00:30:11,288
That could be worth a conversation.

572
00:30:15,393 --> 00:30:20,196
Jesus, now she's showing
up where I live.

573
00:30:33,243 --> 00:30:34,477
What are you doing here?

574
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:36,812
You picked the wrong plant.

575
00:30:36,847 --> 00:30:38,047
I knew I could do better.

576
00:30:38,082 --> 00:30:39,315
Hopefully you won't kill it.

577
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,550
What is it?

578
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:43,553
It's a spotted phalaenopsis.

579
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:46,055
See the red on the petals?
Remind you of anything?

580
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:47,456
Blood spatter.

581
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:49,559
Which reminded me of you.

582
00:30:49,593 --> 00:30:53,563
You came all the way out here
just to bring me that?

583
00:30:53,597 --> 00:30:56,466
- How'd you find me?
- Google.

584
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,134
Now who's a stalker?

585
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,508
I should ask her to leave.

586
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,076
So you want to come in?

587
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,845
Yeah, sure.

588
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:10,981
I'll help you find a place for it.

589
00:31:11,015 --> 00:31:13,417
I need a spot near a window,

590
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:18,222
but not directly in front of it.

591
00:31:20,124 --> 00:31:23,093
Uh, no, that's the bedroom.

592
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:25,763
No plants in here.
Not enough light.

593
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:29,167
You could open the shades.

594
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:31,102
I like the dark.

595
00:31:31,137 --> 00:31:32,538
So do I.

596
00:31:32,572 --> 00:31:33,906
Why is she here?

597
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:39,545
What does she want?

598
00:31:43,817 --> 00:31:45,551
There.

599
00:31:45,585 --> 00:31:47,787
Now you can look
at it when you wake up.

600
00:31:47,821 --> 00:31:51,357
And when you go to bed.

601
00:31:54,428 --> 00:31:57,363
Sorr--I gotta take this.

602
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:00,600
Hey, Deb. What's up?

603
00:32:00,634 --> 00:32:02,035
Uh, nothing, just that

604
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:03,536
LaGuerta might have another theory

605
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,904
that could royally fuck us.

606
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:06,540
Can you meet me at my house?

607
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:07,874
I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

608
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:10,611
Dex, this can't wait.

609
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:12,746
All right, I'll meet you in 20.

610
00:32:20,923 --> 00:32:22,423
I'm telling you, Dexter,

611
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:24,058
LaGuerta's not just
gonna forget this one.

612
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:26,594
Jordan Chase is long gone.
So are the others.

613
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:30,164
There's nothing
to trace them back to me.

614
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:34,002
Are you sure about that?

615
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,838
There are no loose ends?

616
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:39,908
What about the person
you were working with?

617
00:32:39,942 --> 00:32:41,409
I don't know what
you're talking about.

618
00:32:41,444 --> 00:32:43,178
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

619
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:47,349
There were two vigilante
killers, not one.

620
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:51,753
Who was helping you?

621
00:32:51,787 --> 00:32:53,822
She wasn't helping me.
I was helping her.

622
00:32:53,856 --> 00:32:55,990
Was she one of their victims?

623
00:32:56,025 --> 00:32:58,861
It doesn't matter.

624
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:00,129
If LaGuerta tracks her down,

625
00:33:00,163 --> 00:33:01,630
which is next to impossible,

626
00:33:01,665 --> 00:33:03,866
she won't incriminate herself, or me.

627
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,470
- How do you know that?
- Trust me, I just do.

628
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:12,909
Motherfucker.

629
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:19,648
You were together.

630
00:33:19,683 --> 00:33:24,320
Like a couple.

631
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:26,523
I remember having a thought that...

632
00:33:26,557 --> 00:33:31,562
whoever was doing this
was doing it for love.

633
00:33:31,597 --> 00:33:35,166
That was right after Rita died.

634
00:33:35,201 --> 00:33:39,471
You had that tenant with
that weird fucking name.

635
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:43,642
Lumen.

636
00:33:43,676 --> 00:33:45,744
- It was her, wasn't it?
- It doesn't matter.

637
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:47,546
It was.

638
00:33:47,581 --> 00:33:49,915
Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter.

639
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,686
You moved your girlfriend
into the house

640
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,191
where Trinity murdered your wife...

641
00:33:58,225 --> 00:33:59,559
so you could kill together?

642
00:33:59,593 --> 00:34:01,560
It wasn't like that.

643
00:34:03,096 --> 00:34:05,164
I felt guilty about
what happened to Rita.

644
00:34:05,198 --> 00:34:07,332
- You fel--
- I thought that maybe

645
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:13,338
if I helped Lumen...

646
00:34:13,373 --> 00:34:15,107
I was trying to make things right.

647
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:16,375
Of course.

648
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:19,679
By murdering five other people.

649
00:34:24,986 --> 00:34:26,352
Why can't the past
just stay in the past?

650
00:34:26,387 --> 00:34:28,221
Do we have to keep talking about this?

651
00:34:28,255 --> 00:34:31,591
Yeah, we do, as long as
LaGuerta has a bug up her ass.

652
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:34,594
Let me worry about LaGuerta, please!

653
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:36,229
You just--

654
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:40,966
worry about yourself.

655
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:42,234
Go out.

656
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:44,437
Have fun.

657
00:34:44,471 --> 00:34:46,740
Go on a date.

658
00:34:46,774 --> 00:34:50,476
That guy, Sal Price.
He was into you.

659
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,478
Get out of my house.

660
00:34:52,513 --> 00:34:56,348
What did I say?

661
00:35:06,493 --> 00:35:08,494
I really need to kill someone.

662
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,268
Hannah's become
a real thorn in my side.

663
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:21,173
Maybe her handyman can give
me what I need

664
00:35:21,207 --> 00:35:24,176
to finally fix my problem.

665
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,312
Excuse me.

666
00:35:26,346 --> 00:35:28,013
Is Hannah here?

667
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:29,448
She's at the flower market.

668
00:35:29,482 --> 00:35:31,950
Oh, man.
I drove all the way out here.

669
00:35:31,985 --> 00:35:33,185
Do you know when she'll be back?

670
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:36,955
An hour or so.
It might be sooner.

671
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,457
You could wait.

672
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:55,541
How long have you been working here?

673
00:35:55,576 --> 00:35:56,843
About ten years.

674
00:35:56,877 --> 00:35:59,012
So you knew the previous owner.

675
00:35:59,046 --> 00:36:01,448
Beverly Grey?

676
00:36:01,482 --> 00:36:02,683
Hannah said she passed away.

677
00:36:02,717 --> 00:36:05,118
Heart disease.
Sad story.

678
00:36:05,153 --> 00:36:06,686
Yeah, Hannah said they were close.

679
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,056
It must have been hard on her.

680
00:36:10,091 --> 00:36:11,791
I'm sure it was, but...

681
00:36:11,825 --> 00:36:13,226
she never let it show.

682
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,694
Not the emotional type, huh?

683
00:36:14,728 --> 00:36:16,295
I never saw anything like it.

684
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:19,331
Even when Beverly got sick,
Hannah never complained.

685
00:36:19,365 --> 00:36:22,367
Never asked for help.

686
00:36:22,402 --> 00:36:23,802
Help with what?

687
00:36:23,836 --> 00:36:26,004
Taking care of Beverly.

688
00:36:26,038 --> 00:36:27,639
Hannah bathed her, fed her,

689
00:36:27,673 --> 00:36:29,207
took her to the doctor's.

690
00:36:29,242 --> 00:36:30,909
All alone?

691
00:36:30,943 --> 00:36:32,244
She was stubborn, man.

692
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:33,879
I figured it had

693
00:36:33,913 --> 00:36:35,480
something to do with growing
up on a farm, you know?

694
00:36:35,515 --> 00:36:37,983
Just...plowing through.

695
00:36:38,017 --> 00:36:39,818
Look, I tried to help out.

696
00:36:39,852 --> 00:36:41,219
Hannah dug her heels in.

697
00:36:41,254 --> 00:36:42,486
Wouldn't let anybody near Beverly.

698
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:44,088
Which means Hannah was the only one

699
00:36:44,122 --> 00:36:47,091
who had the access to poison her.

700
00:36:51,864 --> 00:36:54,666
Hey, Hannah mentioned
a purple wildflower

701
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,268
that grows on the property.

702
00:36:56,302 --> 00:36:57,902
Thought it would
look great in my place.

703
00:36:57,937 --> 00:37:01,439
I'm thinking I could
take a look while I wait.

704
00:37:01,474 --> 00:37:05,543
All the wildflowers are over
in the southwest corner.

705
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:26,097
Aconite.

706
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:28,933
Price is right.
Yet again.

707
00:37:28,967 --> 00:37:30,267
Beautiful and dangerous.

708
00:37:30,302 --> 00:37:35,940
Just like Hannah.

709
00:37:37,275 --> 00:37:39,410
She's harvested it.

710
00:37:39,444 --> 00:37:42,213
Maybe she's set her sights
on a new target.

711
00:37:42,248 --> 00:37:43,915
You're after her.

712
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:46,984
Who's to say she isn't after you?

713
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:50,421
But why?

714
00:37:50,456 --> 00:37:51,656
She doesn't think I'm a threat.

715
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,923
She accepted my apology.

716
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:54,391
Don't be naive, Dexter.

717
00:37:54,426 --> 00:37:57,395
You think she's a killer,
but not a liar?

718
00:37:57,429 --> 00:38:00,498
Dexter?

719
00:38:00,532 --> 00:38:02,167
What are you doing here?

720
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:04,002
I was, uh...

721
00:38:04,036 --> 00:38:06,672
in the neighborhood.

722
00:38:06,706 --> 00:38:08,007
Well, come on in.

723
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:11,310
I'll make some coffee.

724
00:38:21,954 --> 00:38:24,956
Careful, it's hot.

725
00:38:27,226 --> 00:38:30,861
And potentially deadly.

726
00:38:32,498 --> 00:38:36,201
Hannah, I wish I had more time,
but I gotta get to work.

727
00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:37,702
You know,
I don't understand you, Dexter.

728
00:38:37,737 --> 00:38:39,938
I can't figure out what it is

729
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:41,440
that you really want.

730
00:38:41,474 --> 00:38:42,674
Nothing.
I don't want anything.

731
00:38:42,709 --> 00:38:44,343
You obviously want something.

732
00:38:44,377 --> 00:38:46,178
You keep making excuses to see me.

733
00:38:46,212 --> 00:38:47,512
They weren't excuses.

734
00:38:47,547 --> 00:38:48,781
It's honestly getting a little creepy

735
00:38:48,815 --> 00:38:50,115
that you keep coming by.

736
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,950
Creepy?
You came to my place too.

737
00:38:51,985 --> 00:38:53,719
Well then why don't you just
save us both the trouble,

738
00:38:53,753 --> 00:38:54,987
and spit it out.

739
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:56,988
I want to take you out.

740
00:38:57,023 --> 00:38:59,357
On a date?

741
00:38:59,392 --> 00:39:00,625
That'll work.

742
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:04,228
Well, that's sweet.

743
00:39:04,263 --> 00:39:08,833
But I don't date.

744
00:39:08,867 --> 00:39:10,301
I get too attached.

745
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,403
Really? You don't strike
me as the type.

746
00:39:12,438 --> 00:39:14,306
Well, I'm not who people think I am.

747
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,042
So who are you?

748
00:39:17,076 --> 00:39:20,245
On the inside?

749
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,248
Probably still that
15-year-old girl

750
00:39:22,282 --> 00:39:23,982
who ran away with Wayne Randall.

751
00:39:24,017 --> 00:39:26,718
The girl who stabbed
a woman in cold blood.

752
00:39:26,752 --> 00:39:30,021
Except now, I know better.

753
00:39:30,056 --> 00:39:31,356
What do you mean?

754
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:35,160
I mean, he promised me everything.

755
00:39:35,194 --> 00:39:36,394
He was gonna take me to Disney World,

756
00:39:36,429 --> 00:39:40,332
and Santa's Holiday Adventure.

757
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:43,836
Some little Christmas-themed
shithole just outside of Miami.

758
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:45,071
You know it?

759
00:39:45,105 --> 00:39:50,409
Mmmm.

760
00:39:50,443 --> 00:39:53,946
It's the only place in Florida
where you can see the snow.

761
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,182
I was obsessed.

762
00:39:57,216 --> 00:39:59,684
Then we were gonna live
in Argentina, on a farm,

763
00:39:59,718 --> 00:40:01,619
and have this
picture-perfect life.

764
00:40:01,653 --> 00:40:03,521
Sounds pretty good to me.

765
00:40:03,555 --> 00:40:07,191
It was all I could think about.

766
00:40:07,226 --> 00:40:08,893
I longed for it.

767
00:40:08,927 --> 00:40:11,863
I needed it, and I knew
that until I had it,

768
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:14,532
I would never be satisfied.

769
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:15,867
The craziest part is

770
00:40:15,902 --> 00:40:17,636
that somehow I had myself convinced

771
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,206
that Wayne was the only one
who could give it to me.

772
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,474
Wayne? Really?

773
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:24,977
Why?

774
00:40:25,012 --> 00:40:29,649
I had it in my head
that he was the answer.

775
00:40:29,683 --> 00:40:34,720
That he was gonna fill the
emptiness that I felt inside.

776
00:40:34,754 --> 00:40:38,590
So I didn't care when
he turned out to be the bad guy.

777
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:41,827
I didn't care if he shot somebody.

778
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:45,631
I didn't even care
if I ended up in juvie.

779
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:49,602
Not until later, anyway.

780
00:40:49,636 --> 00:40:52,905
It was worth it...

781
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,109
just to hold on to the fantasy.

782
00:40:57,144 --> 00:41:02,748
You still feel that way?

783
00:41:02,783 --> 00:41:05,084
No. Now I do whatever it takes
to make sure I don't

784
00:41:05,118 --> 00:41:09,788
lose myself like that again.

785
00:41:09,822 --> 00:41:12,490
But I do still wish
I had gotten to see the snow.

786
00:41:18,564 --> 00:41:20,532
You know I'm not Wayne, right?

787
00:41:28,675 --> 00:41:30,943
I'm not gonna land you in jail.

788
00:41:30,978 --> 00:41:32,946
I still think it's a bad idea.

789
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,547
Then why'd you come to my apartment?

790
00:41:34,582 --> 00:41:36,149
You know why.

791
00:41:36,183 --> 00:41:40,053
Go out with me.

792
00:41:40,088 --> 00:41:44,224
Come on, I'm just gonna
keep stalking you.

793
00:41:46,527 --> 00:41:48,795
I'm just--I'm just trying
to do the right thing.

794
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:53,734
Do the wrong thing.

795
00:41:53,768 --> 00:41:55,636
Fine.

796
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,239
One date.

797
00:41:58,273 --> 00:41:59,640
But if I end up in jail--

798
00:41:59,674 --> 00:42:04,578
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

799
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:12,819
A date?

800
00:42:12,854 --> 00:42:14,521
Really?

801
00:42:14,555 --> 00:42:17,124
She caught me off-guard.
I had to think of something.

802
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:26,234
Nadia, it's Joey.

803
00:42:26,268 --> 00:42:28,102
I stopped by the club last night
and you weren't there.

804
00:42:28,136 --> 00:42:29,437
I know I've called, like, 50 times.

805
00:42:29,471 --> 00:42:31,005
I'm just worried about you.

806
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,075
Please, call me back.
Let me know you're okay.

807
00:42:35,978 --> 00:42:37,545
- You got a sec?
- Not really, I--

808
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:39,847
Do I seem impulsive to you?

809
00:42:39,882 --> 00:42:42,217
Jamie says I make bad decisions.

810
00:42:42,251 --> 00:42:46,021
But I have this opportunity,
and I'm thinking about retiring.

811
00:42:46,055 --> 00:42:48,123
Holy shit.
You're retiring?

812
00:42:48,157 --> 00:42:50,459
No, I-I didn't say that.
I'm just considering my options.

813
00:42:50,493 --> 00:42:54,696
Can we talk later?
I got shit to do.

814
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,565
Hey, L.T., did you know
Angel's thinking about retiring?

815
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:59,802
- Masuka!
- Is that true?

816
00:42:59,837 --> 00:43:03,039
I want to buy a restaurant.

817
00:43:03,073 --> 00:43:04,641
- Will you give us a minute?
- Yeah, fine.

818
00:43:04,675 --> 00:43:06,610
But for the record,
studies show that men who retire

819
00:43:06,644 --> 00:43:08,545
are usually dead in five years.

820
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:11,681
It's a fact.
Look it up.

821
00:43:17,354 --> 00:43:22,324
Where is this coming from?

822
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:25,161
Is this about Mike Anderson's
murder, 'cause...

823
00:43:25,195 --> 00:43:26,596
we've been through this.

824
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:29,832
I think I'm burnt out, Deb.

825
00:43:29,867 --> 00:43:32,501
I don't date.

826
00:43:32,536 --> 00:43:35,338
I hardly see my kid.

827
00:43:35,372 --> 00:43:36,906
I'm so focused on work that

828
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,442
I forgot to have a life.

829
00:43:39,476 --> 00:43:41,110
And I know this may sound crazy,

830
00:43:41,145 --> 00:43:44,581
but the idea of buying this restaurant

831
00:43:44,615 --> 00:43:48,251
actually makes me happy.

832
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:54,357
Doesn't sound crazy at all.

833
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:31,229
Sal Price.

834
00:44:31,264 --> 00:44:33,832
Sal, hey.
It's Debra Morgan, from--

835
00:44:33,867 --> 00:44:36,469
Lieutenant Morgan,
with the potty mouth.

836
00:44:36,503 --> 00:44:38,104
Right, with the potty mouth.

837
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:39,839
To what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure?

838
00:44:39,873 --> 00:44:41,373
Are you still up for that drink?

839
00:44:41,408 --> 00:44:43,576
Yeah, absolutely.

840
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:46,412
- But, I thought you said--
- I think I need to get a life.

841
00:44:46,446 --> 00:44:48,180
Yes, you do.

842
00:44:55,188 --> 00:44:57,422
- Case number?
- 98760.

843
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,095
That's, uh, Dixon case.

844
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:06,098
I-I gotta testify
in court next week.

845
00:45:06,132 --> 00:45:09,101
Need a refresher on the evidence.

846
00:45:09,136 --> 00:45:11,270
Dry section.
Bin 51, shelf 4.

847
00:45:11,305 --> 00:45:16,008
Third one over.
Back, and to the right.

848
00:45:18,645 --> 00:45:21,547
- Case number?
- Case 16258.

849
00:45:21,581 --> 00:45:23,215
Layva.

850
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,784
Should be two or three boxes.

851
00:45:24,818 --> 00:45:28,487
It goes to arraignment next month.

852
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,603
Fuck me.

853
00:46:20,873 --> 00:46:24,843
Oral fixation?

854
00:46:24,877 --> 00:46:27,145
Sorry. Bad habit.

855
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:28,847
When I quit drinking,
I picked up smoking.

856
00:46:28,881 --> 00:46:31,516
When I quit smoking,
I picked up chewing on things.

857
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:33,852
Straws, pens, toothpicks.

858
00:46:33,886 --> 00:46:36,254
Turns out I have
a problem with moderation.

859
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:37,622
Me too.

860
00:46:37,656 --> 00:46:39,423
That, and an obsessive personality.

861
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:41,792
Which is great for work, but it's...

862
00:46:41,827 --> 00:46:43,627
really shitty for relationships.

863
00:46:43,662 --> 00:46:48,098
Are we talking about me or you?

864
00:46:48,133 --> 00:46:49,367
So what are you working on right now?

865
00:46:49,401 --> 00:46:52,136
You're updating your book, right?

866
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:53,871
That, and another project.

867
00:46:53,905 --> 00:46:56,673
Which I probably shouldn't tell
you about.

868
00:46:56,708 --> 00:46:58,775
Why, is it a secret?

869
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:00,210
'Cause trust me, I can keep a secret.

870
00:47:00,245 --> 00:47:02,513
I don't know.

871
00:47:02,547 --> 00:47:03,981
You're the Lieutenant of Homicide,

872
00:47:04,015 --> 00:47:06,050
and usually when
I tell cops about my theories,

873
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:08,452
they tell me to go fuck myself.

874
00:47:08,486 --> 00:47:12,957
That won't happen here.
I promise.

875
00:47:12,991 --> 00:47:15,826
Come on,
don't be a cop-tease.

876
00:47:15,861 --> 00:47:20,731
A good theory totally
gives me a girl boner.

877
00:47:20,766 --> 00:47:23,234
Okay.

878
00:47:23,268 --> 00:47:24,636
- Off the record.
- Mm-hmm.

879
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,138
You know all that stuff
in my first book

880
00:47:27,173 --> 00:47:29,741
about Hannah McKay being
this innocent young girl?

881
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:31,910
A victim of Wayne Randall's influence?

882
00:47:31,945 --> 00:47:33,178
Yeah.

883
00:47:33,213 --> 00:47:37,216
Well, I think it's bogus.

884
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:40,686
I think Hannah killed her first
victim right along with Wayne.

885
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,488
And I think she kept right on killing.

886
00:47:42,522 --> 00:47:44,857
Go fuck yourself.

887
00:47:44,892 --> 00:47:46,993
If that's true, we're totally fucked.

888
00:47:47,027 --> 00:47:49,095
- We gave her immunity.
- It's true.

889
00:47:49,129 --> 00:47:50,763
I have evidence to back it up.

890
00:47:50,797 --> 00:47:53,065
It's in my bag right now.

891
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,034
- Wait, you have it here?
- Why, do you want to see it?

892
00:47:55,068 --> 00:47:56,535
Price, you have to show it to me.

893
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:57,870
I'm the Lieutenant of Homicide.

894
00:47:57,905 --> 00:48:02,274
Look at you.
Like a dog with a bone.

895
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:03,710
If you show it to me,

896
00:48:03,744 --> 00:48:08,881
I'll totally make out with you.

897
00:48:08,915 --> 00:48:10,215
Best first date ever.

898
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:15,787
Okay.

899
00:48:15,821 --> 00:48:18,923
So these are the spatter photos

900
00:48:18,957 --> 00:48:20,724
from the bodies you dug up.

901
00:48:20,759 --> 00:48:22,092
I've seen those.

902
00:48:22,127 --> 00:48:23,861
Dexter said the evidence
was inconclusive.

903
00:48:23,895 --> 00:48:25,128
My blood guy disagreed.

904
00:48:25,163 --> 00:48:26,396
Well, there's no way.

905
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:27,631
My brother's never wrong.

906
00:48:27,665 --> 00:48:29,099
My guy said the void pattern

907
00:48:29,133 --> 00:48:30,701
on this body indicates a killer

908
00:48:30,735 --> 00:48:32,769
much smaller than Wayne Randall.

909
00:48:32,804 --> 00:48:36,406
Smaller.

910
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,843
Smaller like Hannah McKay?

911
00:48:45,649 --> 00:48:49,218
Fuck balls.

912
00:48:49,253 --> 00:48:53,323
You gotta be kidding me.

913
00:49:13,111 --> 00:49:16,447
I thought this place
was closed for the season.

914
00:49:16,481 --> 00:49:18,649
It is.

915
00:49:18,684 --> 00:49:21,853
So how are we gonna get in?

916
00:49:21,887 --> 00:49:26,691
How do you feel about
a little breaking and entering?

917
00:49:28,394 --> 00:49:31,930
Yeah.

918
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:41,340
All of us have some kind of longing.

919
00:49:41,374 --> 00:49:45,043
A need crying out to be met.

920
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:12,238
- What is this place?
- Shh.

921
00:50:12,272 --> 00:50:14,407
Wait.

922
00:50:21,782 --> 00:50:24,250
Some of us get what we want,
and we're happy.

923
00:50:24,284 --> 00:50:28,321
The snow.

924
00:50:28,355 --> 00:50:29,656
I thought maybe if you saw it,

925
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,691
you could finally get some peace.

926
00:50:34,462 --> 00:50:37,873
Thank you.

927
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,927
Thank you.

928
00:50:48,476 --> 00:50:50,410
But some of us are never satisfied.

929
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,107
When I said I wanted to take you out,

930
00:51:20,142 --> 00:51:22,376
this is what I meant.

931
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:26,613
You said you wanted to see the snow.

932
00:51:26,648 --> 00:51:32,619
This is what keeps me up at night.

933
00:51:32,654 --> 00:51:37,157
This is what I long for.

934
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:42,996
This is what I need to...

935
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:46,099
fill my emptiness.

936
00:51:56,610 --> 00:52:02,015
Do what you gotta do.

937
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,816
Dexter.

938
00:52:58,944 --> 00:53:01,712
Oh.

939
00:53:11,156 --> 00:53:16,156
