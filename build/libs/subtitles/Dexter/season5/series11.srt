<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

5
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,117
Emily Birch?
Is that her...

6
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:51,286
the one whose blood
Jordan wears around his neck?

7
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,788
Yeah.

8
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:54,656
It was almost 20 years ago.

9
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,792
He was Eugene Greer.

10
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,460
That's Jordan Chase?

11
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,629
No one could ever take
your place.

12
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,631
You know that.

13
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:05,333
You know, I'm glad
you didn't touch any of them.

14
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:06,568
Really?
Why is that?

15
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:08,170
Because this DNA test
will clear you

16
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:10,005
and leave you all to me...

17
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,139
And to her.

18
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:12,741
The men who hurt you,
they made DVDs

19
00:02:12,775 --> 00:02:14,142
of everything they did.

20
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:15,410
Did everyone watch it?

21
00:02:15,444 --> 00:02:17,913
I managed to get it
out of evidence in time.

22
00:02:17,947 --> 00:02:19,447
You think
you can just pay me off

23
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:21,683
like I'm the corner whore?

24
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:23,451
<i>Stay the fuck away from Deb!</i>

25
00:02:23,486 --> 00:02:25,554
I trusted you.

26
00:02:25,588 --> 00:02:27,055
And while you were fucking me,

27
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:29,825
you were spreading shit
about my brother behind my back.

28
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:31,459
Fuck you.

29
00:02:31,494 --> 00:02:33,128
- Who'd you say you were?
- A friend of Joey's.

30
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:35,163
I got to pick up
a few things for a stakeout.

31
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:37,966
It's for Detective Quinn.
You see his name there.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,368
A strange call
came into my office

33
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:41,837
from an Alex Tilden.

34
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:45,040
Alex Tilden, 3040.

35
00:02:45,074 --> 00:02:46,208
Here it is.

36
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:48,643
Look at this.
Looks like a partial footprint.

37
00:02:48,678 --> 00:02:50,946
What if the vigilante
is one of their victims?

38
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,481
This all becomes so...

39
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:54,616
Natural.

40
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,818
- Uhh!
- You okay?

41
00:02:56,853 --> 00:02:58,353
Yes.

42
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:03,625
But with Lumen,
I'm someone different.

43
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,629
In her eyes,
I'm not a monster at all.

44
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:31,987
Detectives.

45
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:33,822
We appreciate you
fitting us in.

46
00:03:33,856 --> 00:03:35,724
We wanted to thank you
for your phone call

47
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:37,926
regarding Alex Tilden...
It was really helpful.

48
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,095
- That's good to hear.
- We followed up immediately.

49
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:41,529
We went to his house, but...

50
00:03:41,564 --> 00:03:42,731
It looked like
we had just missed him.

51
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,099
Oh, that's unfortunate.

52
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:45,467
Yeah, it is, because...

53
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:48,003
He seems to have disappeared
off the face of the earth.

54
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:49,170
I see.

55
00:03:49,205 --> 00:03:50,639
Yeah, like Cole Harmon.

56
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:52,474
And Boyd Fowler.

57
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:53,742
Yeah, him too.

58
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,844
Now, I keep asking myself,

59
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:57,479
what's the connection?

60
00:03:57,513 --> 00:04:00,582
What do these three people
have in common?

61
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,717
You.

62
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:04,352
You're what
they have in common... you.

63
00:04:04,387 --> 00:04:05,520
Oh, here it comes.

64
00:04:05,554 --> 00:04:07,522
Why don't you just...

65
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:09,057
save us a lot of time

66
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:10,625
and tell us
what that connection is?

67
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,693
[Sighs]

68
00:04:11,727 --> 00:04:12,794
[Scoffs]

69
00:04:12,828 --> 00:04:14,095
It's ridiculous

70
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,431
that you think I have anything
to do with this.

71
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,033
I gave you my DNA!

72
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:21,703
What were the results?
Go on, remind me.

73
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:25,040
Your DNA wasn't found
on any of the barrel girls.

74
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:27,242
That's correct,
so all this right here

75
00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:29,444
is a colossal waste
of my time and yours.

76
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,046
Well, I've got
nothing but time.

77
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,614
So you can keep
fooling everybody

78
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,849
in your little seminars,
but I'm onto you.

79
00:04:34,884 --> 00:04:36,685
You're obsessed with me.

80
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:39,054
That's what this is about.

81
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:40,622
It happens... you achieve
a bit of fame,

82
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:44,192
and people latch onto you
in various twisted ways.

83
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:45,327
I'd be careful if you were you.

84
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:46,428
It's typically seen

85
00:04:46,462 --> 00:04:47,629
in someone
who's trying to avoid

86
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,498
facing the dismal nature
of her own small life.

87
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,500
- I think you slipped up.
- It's not at all healthy.

88
00:04:52,535 --> 00:04:53,702
And I think a barrel girl
got away.

89
00:04:53,736 --> 00:04:55,503
It's something
I can help you with.

90
00:04:55,538 --> 00:04:57,906
And now she's hunting down
the people that took her.

91
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,609
And people all around you
are dropping like flies.

92
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:03,712
You could be next.

93
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:06,281
Seriously, I'll be fine.

94
00:05:06,315 --> 00:05:07,816
It's you I'm concerned about.

95
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,351
Don't say I didn't warn you.

96
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,092
Jordan Chase...

97
00:05:17,126 --> 00:05:19,694
We know exactly where he is.

98
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:21,463
Yeah, but...

99
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:24,232
There's no way to get to him.

100
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:26,101
The entire top floor
is guarded.

101
00:05:26,135 --> 00:05:28,770
Elevators?

102
00:05:28,804 --> 00:05:30,372
Monitored.

103
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,242
Stairs?

104
00:05:34,276 --> 00:05:35,577
Locked from the inside.

105
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:38,346
Yeah.

106
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:39,914
But you know how to pick locks.

107
00:05:42,785 --> 00:05:43,718
[Sighs]

108
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,958
Not without setting off
the fire alarm.

109
00:05:49,992 --> 00:05:54,162
[Chuckles softly]

110
00:05:54,196 --> 00:05:56,131
Okay.

111
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:59,334
So we have to figure out a way
to get him to come out.

112
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:01,770
How?

113
00:06:01,804 --> 00:06:05,106
He has everything
he needs up there.

114
00:06:05,141 --> 00:06:07,742
Not everything.

115
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:09,744
Me.

116
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,046
He wants me.

117
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,647
No.

118
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:14,883
There's got to be a way
to use me as bait.

119
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,318
It worked with Cole.

120
00:06:17,353 --> 00:06:19,621
I'm not gonna use you as bait.

121
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:20,989
It's too dangerous.

122
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:22,757
You know I can do this.

123
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:25,560
Yeah, I do.
I saw you kill Alex Tilden.

124
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,062
But we have to be
extra careful.

125
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:30,765
Jordan has more than
just our eyes on him.

126
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,833
The police.

127
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:35,303
My sister.

128
00:06:35,337 --> 00:06:38,006
I'm so sorry that
I put you in this position...

129
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,774
having to lie to her like that.

130
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:43,611
I don't like it,
but it's not the first time.

131
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:46,081
She's never suspected anything?

132
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:49,317
[Chuckles]

133
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:50,351
I don't know.

134
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:52,520
Maybe Deb has a blind spot

135
00:06:52,555 --> 00:06:55,056
when it comes to me.

136
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:56,958
Sometimes I feel like
I'm taking advantage of her,

137
00:06:56,992 --> 00:06:58,660
but it's for the best.

138
00:06:58,694 --> 00:07:00,495
She's not like us.

139
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:02,464
"Us."

140
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:16,077
Oh, uh...

141
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:20,148
There's a camera in the room.

142
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:22,650
The baby monitor
is picking up the signal.

143
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:25,787
Somebody's watching us.

144
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:32,127
Jordan has to be behind this...

145
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,194
And close by.

146
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,430
Wireless cameras
have a limited range,

147
00:07:35,464 --> 00:07:38,633
their signal routed
to a recording unit...

148
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,768
In a vacant apartment...

149
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:43,471
A motor home.

150
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:47,208
A van.

151
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:12,000
It could be anywhere.

152
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:23,011
Ohh.

153
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,879
Jordan Chase is up
to his ball sack in this.

154
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:26,014
I fucking know it.

155
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:27,715
Just means we keep digging.

156
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,883
You coming in?

157
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:30,985
Uh, I got to grab something
from my car.

158
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,220
I'll be right up.

159
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:40,161
- Hey.
- Hey.

160
00:08:40,196 --> 00:08:41,262
What are you doing here?

161
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:43,765
My union appeal's been denied.

162
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,368
I am now officially terminated.

163
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:48,903
So how's your day?

164
00:08:48,938 --> 00:08:51,105
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Don't want your pity.

165
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,273
Good, then...

166
00:08:52,308 --> 00:08:54,576
30 years of putting
bad guys away,

167
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,712
this is what them cocksuckers
upstairs do to me...

168
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,614
take my pension,
wipe their ass with it,

169
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:01,516
and just flush it right on.

170
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,418
Look, I got to get inside.

171
00:09:03,452 --> 00:09:05,353
I need your help on a bust.

172
00:09:05,387 --> 00:09:06,754
A bust?
What are you talking about?

173
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:07,922
Something big,

174
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:09,357
something big enough
to make them stand up

175
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:10,658
and take notice,

176
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:12,327
something big enough
to make them give my my job back

177
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:13,661
on the police force.

178
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:14,696
Your boy Dexter...

179
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,698
What the fuck?
What are you doing?

180
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:18,166
Didn't you hear me, Quinn?

181
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,500
I'm not a cop anymore.

182
00:09:19,535 --> 00:09:21,536
Now, I need a cop
to make this bust.

183
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,271
No.
Forget it.

184
00:09:24,974 --> 00:09:26,941
You little fucking wimp.

185
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:29,911
You're up to your ass
in alligators with this thing,

186
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,379
whether you like it or not.

187
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:34,549
So you're gonna make this bust,
and I'm gonna call you.

188
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,683
You'd best come running.

189
00:09:39,722 --> 00:09:41,589
[Car door opens, closes]

190
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,191
[Engine turning]

191
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:46,094
[Tires squeal]

192
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:55,436
What are you in the mood for?

193
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,238
I'm thinking seafood.

194
00:09:57,273 --> 00:10:00,808
It's a perfect night to grill.

195
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:04,245
I'll go check
what's in the fridge.

196
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,460
Harrison's baby monitor

197
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,296
made it easy to pinpoint
where this was hidden,

198
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,131
but the bigger problem
remains...

199
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,334
what exactly has Jordan heard,

200
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:29,304
and where are those recordings?

201
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:35,910
On second thought,
let's go out to eat.

202
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,354
[Whispering]
It's not Jordan. It's worse.

203
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:47,989
It's someone
from my own station.

204
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,691
What?

205
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:51,492
Why would somebody
from the police department

206
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:52,627
bug your apartment?

207
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:53,895
I don't know,

208
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:55,363
but there's a serial number
on the camera.

209
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:57,131
I'll go in tomorrow
and find out who checked it out.

210
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,433
I don't understand.

211
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:00,401
This could have something
to do with...

212
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:03,171
My sister's theory.

213
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,639
What are you talking about?

214
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:06,674
She has this theory about...

215
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:09,677
Vigilantes hunting down
the rapists.

216
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,779
So you think
she planted cameras?

217
00:11:11,814 --> 00:11:14,749
No, it's not her.
I'd know.

218
00:11:14,783 --> 00:11:17,985
It could be anyone.

219
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,787
But how could they be onto us?

220
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:22,857
We've been so careful.
I don't know yet.

221
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,092
The one good thing

222
00:11:24,126 --> 00:11:26,060
is that no one has seen
those recordings yet.

223
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:27,562
How do you know?

224
00:11:27,596 --> 00:11:31,032
Because
we haven't been arrested.

225
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,568
Jordan is gonna get away
with everything,

226
00:11:33,602 --> 00:11:34,869
and we're gonna be arrested?

227
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,538
We don't know that.

228
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,975
Look, for now, we just pretend
like everything's okay.

229
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:42,243
If we have something
to talk about,

230
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:44,212
we talk about it out here,
where it's safe

231
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:46,013
but we were so close.

232
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:49,050
It can't end this way.

233
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,253
It's not going to.

234
00:12:01,563 --> 00:12:03,197
I checked
with the apartment manager,

235
00:12:03,232 --> 00:12:07,068
then the neighbors.

236
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,003
That motor home is gone.

237
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:10,671
It's got to be
one of these vans.

238
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:12,540
You said there were
four vans last night.

239
00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:14,442
It's down to three now.

240
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:18,346
[Cell phone ringing]
I'll keep checking back.

241
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,014
Sonya, everything all right?

242
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:21,616
Everything is great.

243
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,252
Astor and Cody are spoiling
Harrison silly.

244
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:25,386
Good.

245
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:26,654
He's taking a little nap now,

246
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:28,923
so I was just making a list
for Sunday,

247
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,292
and I wondered, do you have
any special requests?

248
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:34,262
- Sunday?
- Harrison's birthday party.

249
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:35,963
Of course!
Right.

250
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:38,399
Harrison's birthday.

251
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:40,435
Astor and Cody
can't wait to see you.

252
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,770
I'm looking forward
to seeing them too.

253
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:45,706
But hold on a second.

254
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:48,309
It's not safe
to bring everyone here.

255
00:12:48,343 --> 00:12:50,411
- We can go to them.
- You're coming?

256
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:52,947
I just invited myself.

257
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,083
Sonya, we're gonna have
the party in Orlando.

258
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:58,219
Oh.
Uh, okay.

259
00:12:58,253 --> 00:13:01,589
It's... it's just easier than
making everyone drive down here.

260
00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:03,925
Perfect.

261
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,726
[Cell phone beeps]

262
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:07,628
Perfect.

263
00:13:09,865 --> 00:13:11,732
Come on, I got to get to work.

264
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:15,236
Keep an eye on these vans
and call me if you see anything.

265
00:13:16,438 --> 00:13:19,774
[Elevator bell dings]

266
00:13:19,808 --> 00:13:21,676
No torches, no pitchforks,

267
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,245
no one looking at me
any differently.

268
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,113
Dex, I need you.

269
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:28,983
In a minute.
I have something I need to do.

270
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,751
Find out who planted
those cameras.

271
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:32,987
We're all waiting on you.

272
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,856
That doesn't sound good.

273
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,192
[Indistinct chatter]

274
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,433
So, as I was saying,

275
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:48,135
everything keeps leading
back to Jordan Chase.

276
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,937
Why would he be running

277
00:13:49,972 --> 00:13:51,706
<i>a rape club with these putos?</i>

278
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,975
I don't know. But I'm
pretty fucking sure he is.

279
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:56,177
Where are we on the banker,
Alex Tilden?

280
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,311
He's gone.
He disappeared.

281
00:13:57,346 --> 00:13:59,413
We got his DNA
from a toothbrush...

282
00:13:59,448 --> 00:14:01,482
ties him to the barrel girls,
like the others,

283
00:14:01,517 --> 00:14:04,552
but no connection to Jordan
that we can find.

284
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:05,853
Then I suggest
you find that connection.

285
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,188
I'm on it.

286
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,690
- And the dentist, Mendell?
- He's the odd man out.

287
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:11,058
He doesn't seem
to have any connection

288
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:12,393
to any of the other guys.

289
00:14:12,427 --> 00:14:13,961
Well, again,
let's find that connection.

290
00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:15,530
Morgan, Quinn.
We got it.

291
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,398
Phone the neighbors.
Wake the kids.

292
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:18,599
Kick the dog.

293
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:20,902
Remember that muddy
female boot print

294
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:22,270
outside of Tilden's house?

295
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:23,704
Yeah, we found it.

296
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:26,040
Well, my brothers in blue,

297
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,543
it...

298
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,411
has a twin.

299
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:32,747
Found it outside
the vacant house next door.

300
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:35,016
Let me see that.

301
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,684
Naturally, I went inside.

302
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:38,252
The dining room was spotless,

303
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:40,421
and I mean recently cleaned
kind of spotless,

304
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:42,223
unlike the rest of the house.

305
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:45,626
My schnoz also detected
the smell of bleach.

306
00:14:45,661 --> 00:14:47,929
One more day, and the smell
would have dissipated.

307
00:14:47,963 --> 00:14:49,430
My guess...

308
00:14:49,464 --> 00:14:51,832
the vigilante brought
your missing banker over

309
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:54,702
and offed him right there
in the dining room.

310
00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:57,705
Excuse me,
did I hear the word...

311
00:14:57,739 --> 00:14:59,774
"Vigilante"?

312
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,177
[Chuckles]

313
00:15:03,211 --> 00:15:06,948
It was a theory
I was keeping to myself, but...

314
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:10,651
It's out there, but we may have
a vigilante on our hands.

315
00:15:10,686 --> 00:15:12,653
I sent Masuka over to Tilden's

316
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:14,622
to see if he could comb
for any evidence

317
00:15:14,656 --> 00:15:16,457
that a homicide
had taken place.

318
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:17,725
Keep going.

319
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,193
Please don't.

320
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:21,662
There are 13 DVDs...

321
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:23,230
And only 12 victims.

322
00:15:23,265 --> 00:15:26,767
So I'm thinking that
one of the barrel girls escaped,

323
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,903
and now she's after the men
that abducted her.

324
00:15:28,937 --> 00:15:31,272
And she is hunting them,
and she is killing them.

325
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,908
How is that even possible?

326
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:36,010
The barrel girls
are all slight of build.

327
00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:39,013
Alex Tilden was, what,
175 pounds?

328
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:40,014
Minimum.

329
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:41,949
Maybe she had help.

330
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,384
Like who?

331
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:44,885
I don't know.

332
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,053
A...

333
00:15:46,088 --> 00:15:47,855
A man...

334
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:49,690
Someone she trusts...

335
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:52,326
Someone who cares about her...

336
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:54,562
a father, a brother,

337
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:57,531
husband, boyfriend.

338
00:15:59,868 --> 00:16:02,970
So now it's vigilantes
and love.

339
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,739
Yeah, like Romeo and Juliet,

340
00:16:04,773 --> 00:16:06,941
except they didn't kill anyone.

341
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:09,610
No, more like, uh,
Bonnie and, uh...

342
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:10,611
Clyde.

343
00:16:10,646 --> 00:16:11,679
Great.

344
00:16:11,713 --> 00:16:13,047
They ended up dead

345
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:14,682
in a bullet-riddled car.

346
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:16,117
We all have our assignments.

347
00:16:16,151 --> 00:16:17,418
Let's go.

348
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:42,777
Closer to ten minutes.

349
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:45,446
She likes a cup of coffee
with her smoke.

350
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:51,152
But that's more than enough time
to see that...

351
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:54,188
Detective Joseph Quinn
checked out the cameras...

352
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,990
three cameras, to be exact,

353
00:16:56,024 --> 00:16:58,125
two microphones, a recorder...

354
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,293
only three days ago.

355
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:01,495
Maybe no one's seen
the footage yet.

356
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,600
Case number.

357
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:08,703
It's from 1982,

358
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,905
when Quinn was in grade school
eating paste.

359
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:12,273
It's a fake.

360
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:22,983
No court orders authorized
for my address.

361
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:24,618
This is off the books.

362
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:38,032
Quinn's doing this on his own.

363
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:39,934
Lumen, plans for lunch?

364
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,478
Start with the hard drive.

365
00:17:50,512 --> 00:17:53,147
Yeah, any storage devices,
video files,

366
00:17:53,181 --> 00:17:55,816
flash drives.

367
00:17:55,851 --> 00:17:58,319
Wow, this thing is ancient.

368
00:17:58,353 --> 00:17:59,820
Who is this guy?

369
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:01,322
Quinn...

370
00:18:01,356 --> 00:18:04,291
My sister's partner.

371
00:18:04,326 --> 00:18:06,594
Oh, wow.

372
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,295
Are they close?

373
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,298
They used to be.

374
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,534
You got anything?

375
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:15,669
Not much in the way
of video files.

376
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:18,539
Anything of us?

377
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:19,740
No.

378
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,908
Just a cat

379
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,977
that hiccups and farts
at the same time.

380
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:24,879
[Cat hiccups, farts]

381
00:18:24,913 --> 00:18:27,114
Cute.

382
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,016
Check the bedroom.

383
00:18:32,754 --> 00:18:35,823
You take the closet.
I'll check the drawers.

384
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:48,936
Oh, shit.

385
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,704
What is it?

386
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:52,673
- Us.
- The marina.

387
00:18:52,707 --> 00:18:55,643
That's the night
we dumped Cole.

388
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:58,012
He's been watching us
for weeks.

389
00:18:58,046 --> 00:19:00,681
He knows everything.

390
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,851
Wait, you're not gonna
take them with you?

391
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:05,286
Tip him off that we found them?

392
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,987
No, he'll just print more.

393
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,722
We have to find
the digital source.

394
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:12,693
Right.
Find the recording equipment.

395
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:21,602
We're not open anymore.

396
00:19:21,636 --> 00:19:22,870
Mrs. Mendell?

397
00:19:22,904 --> 00:19:24,538
Laura Mendell?

398
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:26,040
Yes?

399
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:28,142
I'm Detective Morgan.
This is Detective Quinn.

400
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:30,544
We'd like to ask you a couple
of questions about your husband.

401
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:33,314
Please, okay?
Just no more questions.

402
00:19:33,348 --> 00:19:37,284
We've been through this, okay?
I don't know anything.

403
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:39,587
Of course, I should have.
Why is that?

404
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:43,123
I mean, I was very naive,
but now it all makes sense.

405
00:19:43,158 --> 00:19:45,125
Those weeklong fishing trips
he used to take?

406
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,294
- He'd go without you?
- Of course without me.

407
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:48,963
It was just him
and his buddies.

408
00:19:48,997 --> 00:19:51,098
He called it
his "man time."

409
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:53,601
But, of course, that has
a whole other meaning now.

410
00:19:53,635 --> 00:19:56,337
Did he ever give you names
of the men on those trips?

411
00:19:56,371 --> 00:19:58,272
No.
I never met any of them.

412
00:19:58,306 --> 00:20:00,074
He kept me completely
in the dark

413
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:03,577
about his whole
closeted gay life.

414
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:06,180
I mean, why didn't he
just tell me?

415
00:20:06,214 --> 00:20:07,982
Actually, Mrs. Mendell,

416
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:10,184
we have information
which leads us to believe

417
00:20:10,218 --> 00:20:12,186
your husband wasn't,
in fact, gay.

418
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,721
The crime scene
may have been altered

419
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,789
to give that impression.

420
00:20:15,824 --> 00:20:19,293
But he was linked
to a series of rapes.

421
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,062
And murders.

422
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,164
My God.

423
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:29,603
Who is this man I married?

424
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:32,439
I'm sorry to bring you
that news.

425
00:20:32,474 --> 00:20:35,542
But do any of these names
sound familiar?

426
00:20:35,577 --> 00:20:37,278
Boyd Fowler.

427
00:20:37,312 --> 00:20:39,847
Cole Harmon.
No, I don't know them.

428
00:20:39,881 --> 00:20:41,982
Alex Tilden.

429
00:20:42,017 --> 00:20:44,351
Jordan Chase.

430
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:46,153
- Jordan Chase?
- Yes.

431
00:20:46,187 --> 00:20:49,023
Well, that's him, right there.

432
00:20:49,057 --> 00:20:51,125
"Best 2 man sailing team...

433
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:52,660
Dan Mendell and Eugene Greer"?

434
00:20:52,694 --> 00:20:55,529
Jordan Chase is Eugene Greer...

435
00:20:55,563 --> 00:20:57,965
Or he used to be.

436
00:20:57,999 --> 00:20:59,633
Dan knew him
when they were kids.

437
00:20:59,668 --> 00:21:01,535
It was a really big deal
to him.

438
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:03,337
That's our connection.

439
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:05,172
Why do you think the wife
never had a clue

440
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:06,540
about what was up
with her husband?

441
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:07,841
I mean,
this barrel-girl stuff

442
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:10,344
has gone on the entire time
they were married.

443
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:13,047
He was probably
a really good liar.

444
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:14,815
Men sometimes have
that ability, you know?

445
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,517
It was his fault, not hers.

446
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:18,886
How do you want to go
at this Eugene Greer thing?

447
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,888
Just pull up
everything we can...

448
00:21:20,922 --> 00:21:22,823
school records, juvie records.

449
00:21:22,857 --> 00:21:24,692
I fucking knew Chase
was full of shit.

450
00:21:24,726 --> 00:21:26,694
Who creates a new identity
for themselves?

451
00:21:26,728 --> 00:21:29,029

who has something to hide.

452
00:21:29,064 --> 00:21:31,699
I've got it.

453

[Elevator bell dings]

454
00:21:42,544 --> 00:21:45,179
Jordan Chase lied
about knowing Alex Tilden.

455
00:21:45,213 --> 00:21:46,480
In the past ten years,

456
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,515
Tilden oversaw six properties

457
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,484
purchased
by Chase's corporation.

458
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:51,919
Well, Dan the dentist
also knew him,

459
00:21:51,953 --> 00:21:53,487
and Jordan Chase is an alias.

460
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:54,855
That whole bullshit persona

461
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:56,490
that he built for himself
is a lie.

462
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,125
Yeah, his real name's
Eugene Greer.

463
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,893
Mendell and Chase
were friends as kids.

464
00:21:59,928 --> 00:22:02,529
So wait...
That ties Jordan directly

465
00:22:02,564 --> 00:22:05,499
to each
of the barrel girls' rapists.

466
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,634
Yeah, but still
all circumstantial,

467
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:09,770
not enough to bring him in.
Yeah, but it's enough to bring

468
00:22:09,804 --> 00:22:11,505
his lying ass in
for questioning.

469
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,640
We just got to keep pushing
at him, scare him a little bit

470
00:22:13,675 --> 00:22:15,242
till he starts making
some mistakes.

471
00:22:15,276 --> 00:22:17,911
Deb's closing in on Chase.

472
00:22:17,946 --> 00:22:20,247
Quinn's closing in on me.

473

for both of us.

475
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,091
Uh, yeah,
we've connected Jordan Chase

476
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:32,393
to all of the rapists,

477
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:35,129
so I'm about to nail
this fuck to the wall.

478
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:37,631
Good.

479
00:22:37,665 --> 00:22:40,067
What... what's up?
I'm kind of busy.

480
00:22:40,101 --> 00:22:42,169

for Harrison's birthday.

482

Oh. Well...

483
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,376
I do, but...

484
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:50,677
You have other plans
with Quinn?

485
00:22:50,712 --> 00:22:52,946
What?
No, it... it's with work.

486
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:55,115
It's the case.

487
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,985
Besides, Quinn's the last person
that you'd want to have there.

488
00:22:58,019 --> 00:22:59,319
- Oh?
- Trust me.

489
00:22:59,354 --> 00:23:01,388
So it's over?

490
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:04,491
Yes.

491
00:23:04,526 --> 00:23:06,126
No.
Fuck, I don't know.

492
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:07,661
It's complicated.

493
00:23:07,695 --> 00:23:09,229
You don't have to tell me.

494
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:12,599
He lied to me about something.

495
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:15,302
Must have been something big.

496
00:23:16,871 --> 00:23:18,338
He lied to me about you.

497
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:20,407
About me?
What do you mean?

498
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:23,310
Quinn had this...

499
00:23:23,344 --> 00:23:25,312
Idiot notion that...

500
00:23:25,346 --> 00:23:27,781
You were somehow connected
to Rita's death.

501

[Scoffs]

502
00:23:34,355 --> 00:23:36,657
That's...
It's crazy, I know.

503
00:23:36,691 --> 00:23:37,958
Why didn't you tell me?

504
00:23:37,992 --> 00:23:40,427
Because...

505
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:43,030
Because you've been
through enough.

506
00:23:43,064 --> 00:23:44,798
And I just found out.

507
00:23:47,368 --> 00:23:50,704
When he finally told me,
I felt so betrayed,

508
00:23:50,738 --> 00:23:53,040
because...

509
00:23:53,074 --> 00:23:55,309
As much as I don't want
to admit it,

510
00:23:55,343 --> 00:23:57,177
I really care about him.

511
00:23:57,212 --> 00:23:59,580
"Care," present tense?

512
00:24:01,015 --> 00:24:02,850
It's complicated, remember?

513
00:24:06,054 --> 00:24:07,754
I thought I knew him,

514
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:09,790
and he kept telling me
he loved me.

515
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,759
But what he did,

516
00:24:12,794 --> 00:24:15,562
I mean, I can't have
somebody like that.

517
00:24:15,597 --> 00:24:18,132
You know, you don't lie to
somebody that you're close to.

518
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,900
You have their back.

519

523
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,449
She has someone in her life,
a guy who's helping her,

524
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:38,652
someone that would do anything
and everything for her.

525
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:41,355
How do you know that?

526
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:44,591
Honestly, I don't know, but...

527
00:24:44,626 --> 00:24:47,194
What they're doing
takes devotion.

528
00:24:47,228 --> 00:24:50,264
To kill someone together,
that's some pretty serious shit.

529
00:24:50,298 --> 00:24:53,834
Is that what Lumen
and I have... Serious shit?

530
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,536
He's risking his life.

531
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,404
He's putting everything
on the line

532
00:24:57,438 --> 00:24:59,473
to make what happened
to her right.

533
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,412
As crazy
as that sounds, what...

534
00:25:05,446 --> 00:25:08,649
what word would you use
to describe that but "love"?

535
00:25:11,352 --> 00:25:14,588
[Laughs]

536
00:25:14,622 --> 00:25:16,957
It's pretty fucked up,
isn't it?

537
00:25:18,593 --> 00:25:21,628
Yeah, pretty fucked up.

538
00:25:23,998 --> 00:25:25,732
Kind of beautiful too.

539
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,907
Just got this in.

540
00:25:33,942 --> 00:25:35,676
It's handmade.
It's very chic.

541
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:40,013
- Um, it's not quite me.
- Perhaps one of the rings.

542
00:25:40,048 --> 00:25:42,749
How about that?

543
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,493
It's nice...

544
00:25:53,528 --> 00:25:54,995
Small enough to carry,

545
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:56,830
locking pin,
stainless-steel blade.

546
00:25:56,864 --> 00:25:59,566
How's it feel?
Good.

547
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,002
We'll take it.

548
00:26:03,371 --> 00:26:06,206
- Thank you.
- Sure.

549
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:17,084
It's just an hour or so
till Quinn gets off work.

550
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:19,720
If he decides to check
his recording equipment tonight,

551
00:26:19,754 --> 00:26:22,122
I should be there.

552
00:26:24,192 --> 00:26:27,594
What is Quinn after?
What does he want with us?

553
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:30,330
He doesn't want us.
He wants me.

554
00:26:30,365 --> 00:26:33,533
He was coming after me
before we even met.

555
00:26:33,568 --> 00:26:36,036
I didn't mean for you
to get caught up in this.

556
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,171
You should leave.

557
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:40,207
You tried that
once before, remember?

558
00:26:40,241 --> 00:26:42,876
You tried to ship me away.
That was different.

559
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,845
I don't want you to leave...

560
00:26:44,879 --> 00:26:46,880
For good...

561
00:26:48,783 --> 00:26:52,319
Just till I deal with this.

562
00:26:52,353 --> 00:26:54,688
Deal with it how?

563
00:26:54,722 --> 00:26:56,890
I don't know...
whatever needs to be done.

564
00:26:58,693 --> 00:27:00,427
[Sighs] I appreciate the offer,

565
00:27:00,461 --> 00:27:02,963
but I'm not going anywhere.

566
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:07,100
- Lumen, it's getting dangerous.
- [Scoffs] Getting dangerous?

567
00:27:07,135 --> 00:27:08,902
I'm not walking away.

568
00:27:08,936 --> 00:27:12,139
We're a team.

569
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,308
We have serious shit.

570
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:16,877
What does that mean?

571
00:27:16,911 --> 00:27:19,446
It's just something
Deb said about us.

572
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,915
You told her about us?

573
00:27:21,949 --> 00:27:24,651
No, she was talking
about the vigilantes.

574
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:25,852
She was talking about us

575
00:27:25,887 --> 00:27:27,487
without knowing
she was talking about us.

576
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:28,889
Oh.

577
00:27:34,595 --> 00:27:38,365
[Sighs]

578
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,367
Maybe...

579
00:27:40,401 --> 00:27:42,102
We should both take off.

580
00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:52,479
Get on a cruise ship.

581
00:27:52,513 --> 00:27:54,948
Hop a freighter.

582
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:57,451
Steal a tugboat.

583
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,629
You said that
you didn't want me to leave.

584
00:28:09,664 --> 00:28:11,598
Does that mean
that you want me to stay?

585
00:28:11,632 --> 00:28:13,500
I do.

586
00:28:21,676 --> 00:28:24,444
We should go.

587
00:28:28,449 --> 00:28:31,151
Okay, so Eugene Greer

588
00:28:31,185 --> 00:28:34,054
grew up in some redneck town
near Tallahassee.

589
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:36,857
He had a single mom,
now dead, no siblings,

590
00:28:36,891 --> 00:28:38,692
pretty nondescript childhood.

591
00:28:38,726 --> 00:28:42,362
Moved to Miami when he was 18,
dropped about 100 pounds,

592
00:28:42,397 --> 00:28:44,398
changed his name
to Jordan Chase,

593
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,466
pretty much reinvented himself.

594
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:50,837
Take a look at these
before-and-after photos.

595
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:52,339
Ooh.

596
00:28:52,373 --> 00:28:53,774
Like a different person.

597
00:28:53,808 --> 00:28:55,108
I think he might have had

598
00:28:55,143 --> 00:28:56,810
some plastic surgery
along the way.

599
00:28:56,844 --> 00:28:58,278
Look at this.

600
00:29:02,383 --> 00:29:04,584
When they'd be off doing
their thing at the same time,

601
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:06,286
each of the barrel girls
disappeared.

602
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,854
Fuck, they did this for years.

603
00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:09,022
Mm-hmm.

604
00:29:09,056 --> 00:29:11,458
[Cell phone vibrates]

605
00:29:11,492 --> 00:29:13,460
I got to take this.

606
00:29:29,043 --> 00:29:33,146
I'm, uh, having
a really tough time here.

607
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:35,081
Doing what?

608
00:29:35,116 --> 00:29:37,217
This...

609
00:29:37,251 --> 00:29:38,518
Being with you.

610
00:29:38,553 --> 00:29:40,220
Yeah, well, you should
have thought of that before.

611
00:29:40,254 --> 00:29:41,822
I'm sorry.

612
00:29:41,856 --> 00:29:44,825
I fucked up, I know.

613
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:46,760
I do dumb things.

614
00:29:46,794 --> 00:29:48,261
I'm a dumb guy.

615
00:29:48,296 --> 00:29:51,064
But the one thing I did right

616
00:29:51,098 --> 00:29:55,001
was to get you
to almost like me...

617
00:29:55,036 --> 00:29:57,204
- 'Cause I really love you.
- Don't, Quinn.

618
00:29:57,238 --> 00:29:59,606
No, I mean it.

619
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,576
There aren't
many women like you.

620
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,177
I know that.

621
00:30:04,212 --> 00:30:06,847
You're more like...

622
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:08,748
- A guy.
- A guy?

623
00:30:08,783 --> 00:30:12,686
You don't play games
where I have to figure out

624
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,688
what it is
you're really thinking.

625
00:30:14,722 --> 00:30:16,756
You just say it,

626
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:19,226
usually with a lot
of really filthy words

627
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,362
that I've never heard before.

628
00:30:22,396 --> 00:30:26,533
You're the first woman who's
ever called me on my bullshit...

629
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:28,869
And made me take
a hard look at myself.

630
00:30:28,903 --> 00:30:33,273
It's made me
a better person, I think.

631
00:30:33,307 --> 00:30:36,977
I just don't want to lose you,
that's all.

632
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:38,912
Bad news.

633
00:30:40,581 --> 00:30:42,549
Not only has Jordan
declined our request

634
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:43,817
for another interview,

635
00:30:43,851 --> 00:30:47,487
but he just booked a multi-city
speaking deal in Europe.

636
00:30:47,522 --> 00:30:49,155
Sounds like he's on the run.

637
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,490
No fucking way.

638
00:30:50,525 --> 00:30:52,726
As of tomorrow,
he is untouchable,

639
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,762
unless we can find a way
to keep him here.

640
00:30:55,796 --> 00:30:57,097
But like we keep saying,

641
00:30:57,131 --> 00:30:58,832
we still don't have enough
to arrest him.

642
00:30:58,866 --> 00:30:59,966
No, but, uh...

643
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:02,502
We can ground him
as a material witness.

644
00:31:02,537 --> 00:31:04,738
We just have to get
a court order.

645
00:31:04,772 --> 00:31:07,440
- Should we go to LaGuerta?
- No.

646
00:31:07,475 --> 00:31:09,509
She shoots me down every time.
She won't help.

647
00:31:09,544 --> 00:31:11,311
I can get it myself.

648
00:31:18,886 --> 00:31:21,254
The only van that remains
after 24 hours

649
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:22,455
just happens to be a rental.

650
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,324
Judging by the amount of dust,

651
00:31:24,358 --> 00:31:27,193
it's been sitting there
close to a week.

652
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:33,400
And here comes Quinn,

653
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:36,836
checking in before he heads
to the station.

654
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:42,442
I never wanted it
to come to this.

[Voice trembling]
Lumen, it's me, Emily.

660
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:41,101
What's wrong?

661
00:32:41,135 --> 00:32:43,403
I got a call from Jordan Chase.

662
00:32:43,437 --> 00:32:45,372
He knows I talked to you.

663
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:47,340
What? How?

664
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:48,441
I don't know.

665
00:32:48,476 --> 00:32:50,076
You tell me.

666
00:32:50,111 --> 00:32:51,411
I didn't talk to him.

667
00:32:51,445 --> 00:32:52,612
What is going on?

668
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:54,881
I'm scared.

669
00:32:54,915 --> 00:32:56,549
He scared me.

670
00:32:56,584 --> 00:32:58,418
Emily, I have no idea
what's going on.

671
00:33:00,755 --> 00:33:02,555
I'm going to the police.

672
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,791
I'll tell them everything.
No, no, don't do that.

673
00:33:04,825 --> 00:33:06,359
Why?
They'll protect me.

674

things worse.

00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:12,599
Jordan is too powerful.

You know what he did to us.

681

Just stay in your house.

I want you to make...

what you think you're doing,

but you got to stop it
with this shit.

726
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:30,203
Aw, horseshit.
Nobody's stopping nothing.

727

You're the one who hired me.

00:35:31,438 --> 00:35:32,939
And then I fired you.

Listen, boy, this is going
down with or without you.

730
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:36,810

how this is gonna spin out.

nothing to do with it.

if you want a magician
for the party.

749
00:36:13,848 --> 00:36:15,315

of what I recorded.

But I only got
one problem here.

I didn't have
no search warrant,

758
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:53,253
and these people
are sticklers for rules,

759

just go get him.

Maybe not.

"I got no reason
to make a full confession."

to fly out over an hour ago,

903
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:18,224
and he never showed up.

904
00:45:25,132 --> 00:45:28,434
Emily was killed
with two blows.

905
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:34,240
Lumen was here...

906
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:36,208
multiple footprints
in the blood,

907
00:45:36,243 --> 00:45:37,610
a scuffle.

908
00:45:37,644 --> 00:45:41,447
More blood, not from Emily,
leading out.

909
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:46,051
She was running.

910
00:45:51,825 --> 00:45:53,726
She's putting up a fight.

911
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,928
Lumen.
