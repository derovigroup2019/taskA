1
00:01:46,952 --> 00:01:48,315
<i>Previously on "Dexter"...</i>

2
00:01:48,997 --> 00:01:52,111
When the wife is dead,
90% of the time, the husband did it.

3
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,366
<i>Boyd Fowler. Hobbies: Self-improvement
and storing women in formaldehyde.</i>

4
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:02,580
<i>She saw everything.</i>

5
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,292
This is what happened to the girls before you.

6
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:09,920
Boyd wasn't the only one
who did this to me. There were others.

7
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:12,288
That last fucking bitch...

8
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:13,465
is alive.

9
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:17,678
<i>Someone tried to move
the girls in the barrels.</i>

10
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:21,056
- Where's the driver?
- He took off.

11
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:23,017
<i>That means he's still mine to find.</i>

12
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:25,311
You believe some people deserve to die?

13
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:28,147
Some people don't deserve to live.

14
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:30,026
<i>His name's Cole Harmon.</i>

15
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,905
If this is gonna end badly,
will you please just tell me now?

16
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:38,782
- Might have a job for you.
- And what would that be?

17
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,951
Lookin' into someone.

18
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:42,202
Dexter Morgan.

19
00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:44,872
As far as Quinn goes, I suspended him.

20
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,874
To protect your brother.

21
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:48,847
I trusted you.

22
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:52,755
And while you were fucking me, you were
spreading shit about my brother behind my back.

23
00:02:53,902 --> 00:02:54,972
Fuck you.

24
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:58,589
You're backing off this thing
'cause you're porking that guy's sister.

25
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:00,784
<i>- Your blood results are in.
- Emily Birch.</i>

26
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:02,473
<i>She's not a victim. She's alive.</i>

27
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:06,018
It was almost 20 years ago.
He was Eugene Greer.

28
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:07,937
That's Jordan Chase?

29
00:03:08,427 --> 00:03:10,259
<i>With Lumen, I'm someone different.</i>

30
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,777
<i>In her eyes...</i>

31
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,435
<i>I'm not a monster at all.</i>

32
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:15,362
You know, I'm glad
you didn't touch any of them.

33
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,614
- Why is that?
- Because this DNA test will clear you

34
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,989
and leave you all to me.

35
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:20,908
We may have a vigilante on our hands.

36
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:22,826
One of the barrel girls escaped.

37
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,996
And now she's after the men
that abducted her.

38
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:27,610
Maybe she had help.

39
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,583
A husband, boyfriend.

40
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:36,534
You're gonna give me a full confession.

41
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:38,968
Liddy!

42
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,349
Liddy, it's Quinn.
You're really starting to fucking piss me off.

43
00:03:46,563 --> 00:03:48,018
You said you wouldn't kill her!

44
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
Lumen!

45
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:54,733
<i>Is this the only kind
of love I'll ever find?</i>

46
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:57,962
<i>The kind that ends in blood?</i>

47
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,488
<i>Where are you?</i>

48
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:12,888
You've been in this situation before, Dexter,
and I don't need to tell you how it ended...

49
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:16,171
- With Rita dead.
- I haven't forgotten.

50
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:18,295
Those aren't gonna do you
a lot of good without Jordan.

51
00:04:18,545 --> 00:04:20,392
- I'll find him.
- How?

52
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:23,722
All the girls were raped at
tortured at the same location.

53
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,181
I'm pretty sure that's where he's taking Lumen.

54
00:04:26,664 --> 00:04:29,599
Pretty sure. That sounds like an assumption.

55
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:33,753
It's more than that. Jordan's like me.
He needs his routine.

56
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:40,024
Deb put together a file with all of Jordan's
real estate holdings. It has to be one of them.

57
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:43,490
- Another assumption, Dexter?
- It's all I have to go on.

58
00:04:44,687 --> 00:04:46,845
Lumen sees me for what I really am.

59
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:48,777
And she hasn't turned away from me.

60
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:52,445
She hasn't turned against me.
She's someone I could share my life with.

61
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,195
I will not let her die.

62
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:57,142
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

63
00:04:57,915 --> 00:05:00,196
- Dexter!
- What are you guys doin' here?

64
00:05:00,446 --> 00:05:01,789
It was Astor's idea.

65
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,402
I thought we'd come surprise you
and have Harrison's birthday party here in Miami.

66
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:06,802
Are you surprised?

67
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:09,746
- Boy, am I.
- I been telling him all morning

68
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:12,676
he's gonna see his father.
He couldn't sleep, he was so excited.

69
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:15,461
So happy to see his dad.

70
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:17,025
And, Dexter, don't worry.
We're not movin' in.

71
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,443
We're staying down at the
econo lodge down the street.

72
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:21,238
Do you wanna come have breakfast with us?

73
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:23,154
Yeah, come on, Dex!

74
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:27,693
I wish I could, but there's a situation at work.
I really have to go.

75
00:05:27,943 --> 00:05:31,442
Oh, well, Astor and Cody
had something they wanted to ask you.

76
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,491
Can we do it later?
I just don't have time right now.

77
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:38,894
All I heard on the trip was Dexter,
Dexter, Dexter. It'll just take a minute.

78
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,704
What is it?

79
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:44,970
We wanna stay with you for the summer.

80
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:48,531
Can we please, Dex?
We really, really miss you.

81
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:51,600
Sure, you can.

82
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:56,568
I really miss you guys too.

83
00:06:01,552 --> 00:06:04,238
<i>Chase's private jet was fueled
and sitting on the runway.</i>

84
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:08,477
His pilot was all dressed up with nowhere to go
because Chase never showed up at the airport.

85
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:10,690
- You checked his home.
- And his office.

86
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,852
I think he knows we're on to him.

87
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:15,509
Probably holed up somewhere,
or he's on the run.

88
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,823
I wanna put out an APB,
throw out the net, see if we snag him.

89
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,302
We'll need an arrest warrant for that,

90
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:22,465
and no judge would grant it.
We don't have enough evidence.

91
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,465
Well, we gotta try. We can't just let
that fucker slip through our fingers.

92
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:29,080
We could issue a stake and notify.

93
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,657
Locate him, put him under 24-hour surveillance
until we've got enough to bust him.

94
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:35,784
That's fucking great.

95
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,273
- Where were you last night?
- I had...

96
00:06:43,523 --> 00:06:45,415
a couple things crash down on me.

97
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:49,116
I heard about Chase.
Fucker vanished?

98
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:51,579
Yeah, but LaGuerta just okayed
a stake and notify.

99
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:55,223
Do you think your vigilantes in love got to him?

100
00:06:55,473 --> 00:06:58,510
Well, killing Jordan Chase is not the same
as killing Boyd Fowler.

101
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,545
This guy doesn't take a piss
without bodyguards holding his dick.

102
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:04,798
- So it's still a race.
- A race?

103
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:08,310
To see which couple gets to him first.
Us or the vigilantes.

104
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,807
Assuming they're a couple.

105
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:12,384
Assuming we're a couple.

106
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:17,414
Can't assume anything right now.

107
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:19,566
I'm gonna go review the rape DVDs.

108
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:22,646
- What for?
- In case we missed anything.

109
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:25,484
Or something can get us Jordan.

110
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:44,046
Hello, Dexter.
Nice to hear from you.

111
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:46,701
Whatever you're thinking of doing,
it's not necessary.

112
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:49,802
<i>- We can work something out.
- Nice try.</i>

113
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:53,181
<i>- What do you mean?
- The unemotional approach.</i>

114
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:56,927
But it's not working for you.
You're stressed. I can hear it in your voice.

115
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,614
<i>She really means a lot to you, doesn't she?</i>

116
00:07:59,864 --> 00:08:00,826
Yes.

117
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:04,101
It must be terrible going through this again.

118
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,801
Losing your wife, the woman you loved.

119
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,313
And now Lumen...

120
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:09,563
It's...

121
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:14,521
I imagine it seems to you
like some kind of terrible curse.

122
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,853
Think whatever you want.
Just listen to me.

123
00:08:18,103 --> 00:08:19,291
I'll turn myself over to you.

124
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:21,372
Appreciate the offer, but...

125
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:22,878
I'm afraid I must decline.

126
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:24,574
Then tell me what you want.

127
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:25,838
<i>I have what I want.</i>

128
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,133
And the longer I stay on the phone,
the better your chances of finding me.

129
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:31,613
<i>- So this conversation's over.
- Jordan...</i>

130
00:08:31,863 --> 00:08:33,470
<i>Tick, tick, tick, Dexter.</i>

131
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:35,931
<i>That's the sound of
Lumen's life running out.</i>

132
00:08:36,656 --> 00:08:38,350
<i>So Lumen's still alive.</i>

133
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:46,369
Let me out!

134
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,237
Shit.

135
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:14,358
Jordan Chase!

136
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,230
Come on, come on.

137
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,227
<i>Jordan's real estate holdings.</i>

138
00:10:27,477 --> 00:10:29,499
<i>Lumen has to be at one of them.</i>

139
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:37,000
Any luck on Jordan?

140
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,850
No. Not really.

141
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,876
Except for that. You see that?

142
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:45,005
You see how Cole keeps looking off
at somebody behind the camera?

143
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:47,188
Yeah. You're right.

144
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,160
He's not the only one either.

145
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,910
In all of these videos, these bastards,
they keep looking off as if to get...

146
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,306
approval or instruction or something.

147
00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:56,322
You think they're looking at Jordan?

148
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:59,098
Who else would it be?
It's what this guy does for a living, right?

149
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:02,481
He tells people what to do.
He tells them how to live their lives.

150
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:04,651
I know it's not any evidence or anything,

151
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:07,251
but he's there, he's there, I can feel it.

152
00:11:10,226 --> 00:11:13,903
- You shouldn't look at those anymore.
- I have to fucking look at these things!

153
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:18,153
I understand what these women
went through. Part of it, at least.

154
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:23,210
I know what it is to be taken
by some sick bastard...

155
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:25,602
<i>She can't even say his name.</i>

156
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,302
<i>Rudy. My brother.</i>

157
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:29,545
To know you're gonna die.

158
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:31,928
<i>Is this what I do?</i>

159
00:11:32,178 --> 00:11:34,428
<i>Curse everyone around me?</i>

160
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:37,404
I have to work. If Jordan gets away with this,
I can't live with myself.

161
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:38,985
I know.

162
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:53,423
Commercial real estate.

163
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,524
Strip mall.

164
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:58,298
Condos. Parking garages.

165
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,250
Would you keep a hostage
in any of those places for two weeks?

166
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:03,238
Where, next to the donut shop?

167
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:05,183
It's all too exposed.

168
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:09,144
Jordan must own other properties.

169
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,605
It's right in front of you.

170
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,640
What?

171
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,402
Remember your target,
where he came from, who he was.

172
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:19,141
Jordan wasn't always Jordan Chase.

173
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:33,602
Office of county records.

174
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:35,944
Yeah, this is Dexter Morgan
with Miami Metro Homicide.

175
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:37,913
I need a property records check.

176
00:12:38,163 --> 00:12:40,381
<i>- Name.
- Eugene Greer.</i>

177
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:43,133
<i>- Spell it.
- G-r-e-e-r.</i>

178
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:47,419
<i>- Check back with me tomorrow morning.
- No, this is an emergency. I need it right away.</i>

179
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:50,568
There's no right away in this equation.
I got a pile of shit ahead of me,

180
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:52,958
- and they're all emergencies.
- Look, this isn't some developer

181
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,614
who's about to miss a filing deadline.

182
00:12:54,864 --> 00:12:58,395
A woman's life is on the line.
If you don't do this now, right now, she will die,

183
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:01,850
and you could have done something to stop it.
You understand me? This can't wait.

184
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,199
<i>Everyone, I need your attention.</i>

185
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:06,814
Hello?

186
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:09,030
Yeah. Okay.

187
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,875
I got your number.
I'll get back to you as soon as I have something.

188
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:13,042
Thanks.

189
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:17,265
We're rolling out to Bayfront Park immediately.
We have an officer down.

190
00:13:17,515 --> 00:13:18,599
Stan Liddy.

191
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:21,204
Liddy?

192
00:13:21,454 --> 00:13:22,922
Yes. He's dead.

193
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,595
What do we know, lieutenant?

194
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:28,469
A pedestrian spotted blood
coming out of a parked van, called it in.

195
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:31,259
Unis found Liddy's body inside.

196
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:34,906
Morgan, Quinn, you're running point on this,
so take whoever you need.

197
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,718
<i>Anyone but me.</i>

198
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:40,245
Dexter, grab your kit.
There's a lotta blood.

199
00:13:40,495 --> 00:13:41,433
Okay, that's all, people.

200
00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:44,350
Our crime scene's right across the bay,
so we're taking the boat.

201
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,709
Grab your gear and load up.

202
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,795
Dex. Blood.

203
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,490
Come on, the sooner we get this cleaned up,
the sooner I can get back on Chase.

204
00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:49,563
Sorry. You can't rest here.

205
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:53,213
I know you're tired,
but it's just a little further.

206
00:15:27,882 --> 00:15:30,487
<i>Jordan's had Lumen for 12 hours.</i>

207
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:34,032
<i>Each second I'm stuck on this slow boat
going to my own crime scene</i>

208
00:15:34,282 --> 00:15:36,294
<i>takes her farther away from me.</i>

209
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:39,544
<i>Fate is hardly lending a hand.</i>

210
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:49,423
You okay?

211
00:15:54,044 --> 00:15:56,080
I know you and Liddy were friends.

212
00:15:56,349 --> 00:16:00,899
I helped him with a couple of things,
but I wouldn't say he was an actual friend.

213
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,130
It's just that you looked a little pale
when we left the station.

214
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:05,747
I'm fine.

215
00:16:06,504 --> 00:16:09,104
You have any idea
what might have happened to him?

216
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:10,925
Not a clue.

217
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:12,622
What about you?

218
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:14,628
Any theories?

219
00:16:15,497 --> 00:16:18,297
I haven't examined the crime scene.

220
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:20,271
Wild guess.

221
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:24,650
Heard Liddy was kinda shady.
Maybe something came back to bite him.

222
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:27,478
It's possible, I guess.

223
00:16:45,568 --> 00:16:48,468
Lieutenant, there's something
you really need to see.

224
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,010
Holy shit.

225
00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:54,604
Someone really did a number on him.

226
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,084
Did you bring your full kit, Dex?

227
00:16:57,334 --> 00:17:00,164
<i>Yep. And all my kill tools.</i>

228
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:10,134
Hey, if you're not up to this,
I can handle it.

229
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:14,533
What is it?

230
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:16,787
I don't know how to say it.

231
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:18,245
Say what?

232
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:20,976
Quinn, come with me, please.

233
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:25,377
What's goin' on?

234
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:27,200
It's okay, Deb.

235
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,950
You have a homicide to work, detective.
Get to it.

236
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:41,768
Looks like the van was rigged
with surveillance equipment.

237
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:43,646
What the hell was Liddy watching?

238
00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:45,398
<i>- Me.
- No way to tell.</i>

239
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,692
- Everything's been stripped clean.
- The killer covering his tracks.

240
00:17:49,032 --> 00:17:53,375
Seems to me we find out who Liddy
was spying on, we find our killer.

241
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,663
The unis found Liddy's cell phone.

242
00:17:56,913 --> 00:17:59,586
The last five calls he made
were all to you.

243
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,538
Wanna tell me what that's about?

244
00:18:04,221 --> 00:18:06,321
The man had demons, lieutenant.

245
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:08,568
Your firing him didn't help.

246
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:11,795
And he just needed someone to hear him out.
I was the only friend he had left.

247
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:14,953
Okay, but he must have
kept calling you for a reason.

248
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:16,653
What was it?

249
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,549
- I didn't pick up, I...
- Then he would have left messages.

250
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,449
I need to hear them.

251
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:26,369
Detective...

252
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,028
That looks like blood.

253
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:44,627
Quinn, you better start talking to me.

254
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:47,355
I don't think I should say anything else.

255
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:51,158
Not until I speak to a lawyer.

256
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:52,546
A lawyer?

257
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:55,342
I'm sorry, lieutenant.

258
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,065
You can talk to your lawyer
back at the station.

259
00:19:05,315 --> 00:19:06,315
Officer.

260
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:11,259
Escort Detective Quinn
back to Metro Homicide.

261
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,195
Dexter?

262
00:19:15,474 --> 00:19:20,424
Well, there's no castoff.
We're lookin' at a single thrust expertly applied.

263
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:21,745
<i>Good to see I did something right.</i>

264
00:19:22,158 --> 00:19:24,008
Passive blood pooling.

265
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:28,019
I guess that he was probably
held down as the knife went in.

266
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:29,668
Died instantly.

267
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,045
So the killer knew what he was doing.

268
00:19:33,295 --> 00:19:35,695
<i>Sure felt like it at the time.</i>

269
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,013
Any idea what that's all about?

270
00:19:43,263 --> 00:19:44,263
None.

271
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:49,187
<i>COUNTY RECORDS CALLING</i>

272
00:19:51,175 --> 00:19:52,025
Are you finished?

273
00:19:52,343 --> 00:19:55,765
Yeah, I gotta catch a ride
back to the lab, run some tests.

274
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:56,696
Okay.

275
00:19:58,149 --> 00:20:01,270
Am I the only one who's interested
in this goddamn murder?

276
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,560
- Hello?
- I got a hit.

277
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:06,860
<i>There's one property
belonging to a Eugene Greer.</i>

278
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:10,434
<i>It's listed as a River Jordan Camp
for Boys and Girls.</i>

279
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:11,834
River Jordan.

280
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:14,338
It went bankrupt, like, 20 years ago.

281
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:15,754
<i>A camp.</i>

282
00:20:16,043 --> 00:20:18,543
<i>Jordan took Lumen back
to where it all started.</i>

283
00:20:18,793 --> 00:20:19,793
<i>With Emily.</i>

284
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:21,454
<i>You still there?</i>

285
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:22,808
Yeah. You have an address?

286
00:20:23,058 --> 00:20:26,082
<i>1530 Muralia Road.</i>

287
00:20:26,613 --> 00:20:28,263
<i>- Thanks.
- Anytime.</i>

288
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,141
Where's Quinn going?

289
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:39,250
- The station.
- Why?

290
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:42,745
It looks like he may be
involved in Liddy's murder.

291
00:20:42,995 --> 00:20:44,913
- That's crazy.
- I know, it is.

292
00:20:45,163 --> 00:20:46,734
But he requested an attorney.

293
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:49,365
- An attorney?
- Has Quinn said anything to you about Liddy?

294
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,970
- Anything I should know about?
- No. Nothing.

295
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,851
- I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No!

296
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,710
You're gonna stay here and do your job.

297
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,308
I hope I'm wrong about Quinn,

298
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,232
but right now we need to process the scene
and find out what really happened.

299
00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:35,937
You remember this place?

300
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,007
Should feel like home.

301
00:21:50,913 --> 00:21:52,413
Well, don't worry.

302
00:21:53,117 --> 00:21:54,689
It'll all come back to you.

303
00:21:58,126 --> 00:22:00,626
- What are you gonna do to me?
- What do you think?

304
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:04,329
What choice have you left me?

305
00:22:04,897 --> 00:22:06,137
The two of you.

306
00:22:09,376 --> 00:22:11,366
I spoke with Dexter on the phone.

307
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:16,259
I let him know that you're alive...

308
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:17,975
In need.

309
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,227
I motivated him.

310
00:22:26,788 --> 00:22:28,265
Now, will he come for you?

311
00:22:32,012 --> 00:22:34,339
You know best, but...

312
00:22:34,651 --> 00:22:36,216
I believe he will.

313
00:22:39,306 --> 00:22:40,943
And then what?

314
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,406
We'll be joyously reunited.

315
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,720
The three of us.

316
00:23:07,316 --> 00:23:10,513
You've changed since I saw you here last time.
You know that?

317
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:13,704
You...

318
00:23:14,712 --> 00:23:16,604
You've got this look in your eye.

319
00:23:19,717 --> 00:23:21,306
Did you learn that from him?

320
00:23:35,197 --> 00:23:36,436
Well...

321
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:43,244
- I thought you just liked to watch.
- I know. Well, maybe I'm changing.

322
00:23:43,494 --> 00:23:44,770
Like you.

323
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:08,599
No!

324
00:24:15,896 --> 00:24:18,049
- Where's Quinn?
- Interrogation room.

325
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:20,209
Waiting for his attorney.

326
00:24:20,557 --> 00:24:22,318
- He say anything?
- No.

327
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,120
It's not getting any better for him.

328
00:24:25,825 --> 00:24:26,891
What's that mean?

329
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:33,181
His name's on the requisition forms

330
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:37,128
for the surveillance equipment
we found in Liddy's van.

331
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:39,656
What about the fingerprints we lifted off the van?

332
00:24:39,906 --> 00:24:42,008
Aside from Liddy's, they're all Quinn's.

333
00:24:42,787 --> 00:24:43,905
I wanna talk to him.

334
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,351
Feel free to try.
He won't speak to any of us.

335
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,129
You shouldn't be here, Deb.

336
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:07,900
LaGuerta says you asked for a lawyer.

337
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,045
That's right.

338
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:12,455
Well, before your lawyer gets here,
why don't you tell me what the fuck is going on?

339
00:25:14,732 --> 00:25:16,850
I think I better just keep my mouth shut.

340
00:25:18,035 --> 00:25:20,144
I'm not asking you as a detective.

341
00:25:22,058 --> 00:25:24,189
I'm asking you as someone you live with.

342
00:25:24,511 --> 00:25:26,338
Someone that you said you loved.

343
00:25:27,884 --> 00:25:30,712
I think I deserve to know
what the fuck is going on.

344
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:36,762
All I can tell you is that I didn't kill Liddy.

345
00:25:38,112 --> 00:25:39,188
But you were there.

346
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,777
- It's not what it looks like.
- It looks like you did it.

347
00:25:43,515 --> 00:25:44,515
I know.

348
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,533
If you didn't kill Liddy, who did?

349
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:53,309
I can't say anything else.

350
00:25:54,072 --> 00:25:56,450
- I'm sorry.
- Don't say you're sorry.

351
00:25:58,214 --> 00:26:00,266
Just tell me the fuckin' truth.

352
00:26:03,182 --> 00:26:05,391
You should go work on finding Jordan.

353
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,053
<i>RIVER JORDAN CAMP</i>

354
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:29,165
Jordan Chase was goading you on the phone,

355
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:31,012
trying to get you to make a mistake.

356
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:32,968
- He'll be waiting for you.
- I know.

357
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,939
You need to stay alert, pay attention.

358
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:38,311
- You don't know what he's planning for you.
- Same thing I'm planning for him.

359
00:26:38,561 --> 00:26:40,016
Yeah, but on his home turf.

360
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:43,379
Don't underestimate your adversary,
Dexter, not again.

361
00:26:43,775 --> 00:26:45,682
Could you just trust me for once?

362
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:46,981
Oh, shit!

363
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:39,525
Surprise.

364
00:27:47,972 --> 00:27:48,972
Get up.

365
00:27:59,257 --> 00:28:01,157
- You okay?
- Yeah. Fine.

366
00:28:02,793 --> 00:28:03,993
You look tired.

367
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:05,990
Thanks.

368
00:28:06,878 --> 00:28:08,528
Look, like I said,...

369
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:12,900
we'll know more after Dexter
tests the blood on Quinn's shoe.

370
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,022
In the meantime, have some faith.

371
00:28:17,932 --> 00:28:18,932
Faith?

372
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:20,741
Whatever you call it.

373
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:23,209
Don't assume the worst.

374
00:28:36,852 --> 00:28:38,647
- Detective Morgan?
- Yeah?

375
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:40,260
I'm sorry for intruding.

376
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,432
It's from your stake and notify.
Should I put it on your desk?

377
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:43,876
No. What is it?

378
00:28:44,126 --> 00:28:46,926
Someone said they spotted Jordan Chase.

379
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:48,583
- A street vendor?
- Yeah.

380
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:49,940
Up by Muralia Road.

381
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:54,173
Weird thing is, he thought he heard noises coming
from the trunk. That's why he called it in.

382
00:28:54,423 --> 00:28:56,181
I know, sounds unlikely.

383
00:28:56,431 --> 00:28:58,019
Yeah. Maybe I'll check it out.

384
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,071
Thanks.

385
00:29:26,194 --> 00:29:28,100
It was inevitable that this would happen.

386
00:29:30,731 --> 00:29:32,449
Two broken people,...

387
00:29:32,993 --> 00:29:36,118
going through intense shared experiences
against a common enemy.

388
00:29:36,368 --> 00:29:38,468
I do it in my seminars all the time.

389
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:40,663
It produces a sense of deep,...

390
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:42,213
deep bonding.

391
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:44,366
I'm sure you feel like you actually...

392
00:29:44,705 --> 00:29:47,298
have something, even love.

393
00:29:47,997 --> 00:29:48,781
Doesn't it?

394
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:49,838
Let her go.

395
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:54,038
You lost your wife, Rita.
You blamed yourself, I'm sure.

396
00:29:54,717 --> 00:29:57,967
And you thought what?
That you could make up for that by helping her?

397
00:30:00,262 --> 00:30:01,045
No.

398
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:02,843
Well then, what were you thinking?

399
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,034
That you could be a hero?

400
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,403
You can't save one thing
to make up for another, Dexter.

401
00:30:11,653 --> 00:30:13,903
It's just not the way the world works.

402
00:30:25,761 --> 00:30:27,537
I look at these, and...

403
00:30:28,015 --> 00:30:31,342
I can't help but think
that you have a kind of greatness in you.

404
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,445
Then I look at you,...

405
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,989
and you're no different
that the idiots that show up at my seminars.

406
00:30:38,957 --> 00:30:40,422
Totally lost.

407
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:46,096
I'm gonna put you out of your misery.

408
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:53,873
Both of you.

409
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:26,927
Jordan Chase.

410
00:31:29,353 --> 00:31:31,183
He was waiting for the traffic light?

411
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:34,755
And what about the noise in the trunk?

412
00:31:35,873 --> 00:31:40,286
I fucking swear I'm taking Spanish after this.
The sound in the...

413
00:31:42,224 --> 00:31:43,224
"trunko"?

414
00:31:47,408 --> 00:31:49,034
Bang, bang, bang, from the trunk?

415
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:50,999
Which way did...

416
00:31:53,823 --> 00:31:55,080
What's down that way?

417
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:03,658
- A camp?
- Si, camp.

418
00:32:04,861 --> 00:32:05,861
Thank you.

419
00:32:16,817 --> 00:32:18,521
You'll want to be awake for this.

420
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,817
What do you call it?
Being present in the moment?

421
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:25,735
So you were listening, hmm?

422
00:32:26,374 --> 00:32:28,253
I heard the words, but...

423
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:30,356
to be honest?

424
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:33,945
You have to consider the source.

425
00:32:45,554 --> 00:32:47,404
You should be the one to do it.

426
00:32:50,396 --> 00:32:51,646
Is that okay with you?

427
00:32:53,546 --> 00:32:54,612
He's yours.

428
00:32:57,049 --> 00:32:58,337
Please!

429
00:32:59,851 --> 00:33:02,414
You're acting like there's some
polite way to do this, like there's...

430
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:04,338
some etiquette.

431
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:08,353
Killing is killing, Dexter.

432
00:33:08,855 --> 00:33:10,423
Let's at least be honest about that.

433
00:33:10,673 --> 00:33:12,217
Oh, you're being honest...

434
00:33:12,714 --> 00:33:13,737
Eugene?

435
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:15,993
Oh, you think that's an insult?

436
00:33:16,643 --> 00:33:17,926
It's a compliment.

437
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:20,531
It's a reminder of how far I've come.

438
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:23,660
And how far is that?
You're right back where you started,

439
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,603
only this time,
you're strapped to a table.

440
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:26,962
I'm transformed.

441
00:33:27,212 --> 00:33:28,435
You will be soon.

442
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:29,666
Not just me.

443
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:31,594
You, Lumen.

444
00:33:34,295 --> 00:33:35,974
You don't get to use my name.

445
00:33:39,262 --> 00:33:43,190
Really? If we're not on a first name basis,
the three of us, then who is, hmm?

446
00:33:44,513 --> 00:33:47,763
Look at you.
You're transformed too. You're beautiful.

447
00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:49,395
And you know what?

448
00:33:49,645 --> 00:33:53,142
If you hadn't met me,
you would never have known you had it in you.

449
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:55,890
- I wouldn't have had it in me...
- Well, now you do!

450
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,190
Shut up!

451
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,834
It's truly amazing.

452
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:05,813
You should thank me.

453
00:34:06,063 --> 00:34:08,013
That's not what's gonna happen.

454
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:11,479
I watched you so carefully
the last time you were here.

455
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:14,273
You used to just cower and cry!

456
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:19,680
That's not just for me.

457
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:22,118
That's for everyone that you hurt.

458
00:34:22,368 --> 00:34:23,479
Even Emily.

459
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:25,147
Do you hear me?

460
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,230
Do you hear me?

461
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,640
I'm sorry.

462
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:48,057
I know that's not
how you're supposed to do it.

463
00:34:48,934 --> 00:34:52,608
Well, he was right about that part.
There is no polite way.

464
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:23,757
Maybe we should just leave the body here.

465
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:26,407
We don't want a murder investigation.

466
00:35:26,982 --> 00:35:29,559
We want closure.

467
00:35:30,722 --> 00:35:32,381
So he just vanishes, like the others?

468
00:35:32,696 --> 00:35:35,844
No. Jordan's car is outside.
We'll use it to move the body.

469
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:37,253
Then,...

470
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:42,253
maybe a month from now,
we'll tip off Miami Metro about this place.

471
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:44,831
Everyone will know what he's done.

472
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:31,769
Don't move.

473
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:34,185
Don't fucking move.

474
00:36:37,198 --> 00:36:40,075
Whatever's in your arms, drop it now.

475
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:42,741
Both of you.

476
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:56,742
I know who you are.

477
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:01,929
Number 13.

478
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,580
And I know what they did to you.

479
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,811
I've seen the tapes.

480
00:37:08,573 --> 00:37:10,574
I watched them over and over.

481
00:37:15,674 --> 00:37:18,174
It's a miracle you survived.

482
00:37:19,086 --> 00:37:20,636
A fucking miracle.

483
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:22,841
And you,...

484
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:25,288
whoever you are,...

485
00:37:26,282 --> 00:37:27,582
you know that too.

486
00:37:34,197 --> 00:37:35,255
I said don't...

487
00:37:35,779 --> 00:37:37,668
fucking move!

488
00:37:42,038 --> 00:37:45,438
Maybe it's true some people deserve to die.

489
00:37:46,452 --> 00:37:50,852
But I'm a cop, and I don't
make that fucking decision.

490
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:53,609
So I'm gonna call this in.

491
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:59,409
In an hour, this place
will be swarming with police.

492
00:38:06,854 --> 00:38:09,804
If I were you, I'd be gone by then.

493
00:38:57,815 --> 00:39:00,215
I don't know what you did or didn't do.

494
00:39:00,662 --> 00:39:02,912
And for some reason, you're not saying.

495
00:39:04,972 --> 00:39:06,372
But I'm not judging.

496
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:10,771
I can't judge.

497
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,119
Not anymore.

498
00:39:16,513 --> 00:39:17,763
What do you mean?

499
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,693
Did something happen?

500
00:39:23,504 --> 00:39:24,504
Yes.

501
00:39:27,354 --> 00:39:31,004
A lot, actually.
A lot that I don't understand.

502
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:35,859
You know how LaGuerta keeps
saying everything's complicated?

503
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:40,309
I'm starting to believe her.

504
00:39:42,696 --> 00:39:44,646
I'm glad you're here.

505
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:46,194
Are you?

506
00:39:47,663 --> 00:39:49,598
More than you know.

507
00:39:50,634 --> 00:39:53,634
I'll be here no matter what happens.

508
00:40:18,713 --> 00:40:20,946
Did you ever think we'd get here?

509
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,750
You didn't?

510
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:27,259
Not really, no.

511
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:30,634
I mean, for a while there, I wasn't sure.

512
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:35,324
It's like what your sister said.

513
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,670
It's a miracle.

514
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:40,735
It's a fucking miracle.

515
00:40:58,681 --> 00:40:59,931
Home?

516
00:42:42,528 --> 00:42:46,028
I thought you'd be getting ready
for Harrison's birthday.

517
00:42:46,405 --> 00:42:48,145
LaGuerta said this couldn't wait.

518
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:51,612
She also said
you broke the barrel girls case.

519
00:42:52,047 --> 00:42:53,697
I didn't break it. I...

520
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,188
found the place
where they shot the DVDs,...

521
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,204
this camp where everything happened.

522
00:43:00,513 --> 00:43:01,762
Jordan's missing, though.

523
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,562
Just like the rest of them.

524
00:43:04,194 --> 00:43:06,390
Think it was your vigilantes?

525
00:43:09,108 --> 00:43:10,108
Maybe.

526
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:14,106
At least then we'd know he was dead.

527
00:43:15,503 --> 00:43:17,003
That's just a crazy theory.

528
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,062
What about that?

529
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:28,185
The blood on Quinn's shoe, is it Liddy's?

530
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:32,256
I haven't run it yet.

531
00:43:32,506 --> 00:43:33,856
Do you think it is?

532
00:43:36,793 --> 00:43:37,575
I don't know.

533
00:43:41,975 --> 00:43:43,875
You think you know someone,

534
00:43:46,686 --> 00:43:49,386
and then it turns out you don't.

535
00:43:51,103 --> 00:43:54,153
You think someone's a good cop,
and then they...

536
00:43:56,962 --> 00:43:58,062
do something.

537
00:44:01,451 --> 00:44:03,751
I don't know. All I'm saying is,...

538
00:44:04,027 --> 00:44:06,377
nothing is as simple as it seems.

539
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:09,332
You're right about that.

540
00:44:11,113 --> 00:44:13,113
Tell me as soon as you know.

541
00:44:31,474 --> 00:44:32,524
<i>I know already.</i>

542
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:39,641
Hey, you're up.

543
00:44:40,705 --> 00:44:42,597
I bought some stuff...

544
00:44:43,508 --> 00:44:45,345
for pancakes.

545
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,654
You don't know this about me,
but I'm actually...

546
00:44:47,904 --> 00:44:50,147
kind of a breakfast connoisseur.

547
00:44:51,779 --> 00:44:53,129
The party's today.

548
00:44:53,886 --> 00:44:55,529
Harrison's birthday.

549
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:57,410
You'll get to meet Cody, finally.

550
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,616
Actually, you'll get to meet a lot of people.

551
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:02,035
Everybody from the station.

552
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:05,435
Oh, and the kids want to spend
the whole summer here.

553
00:45:06,132 --> 00:45:07,132
So...

554
00:45:07,832 --> 00:45:09,668
we should probably talk about that.

555
00:45:15,075 --> 00:45:15,799
What?

556
00:45:17,735 --> 00:45:18,735
What is it?

557
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,920
I didn't sleep at all last night.

558
00:45:26,744 --> 00:45:28,310
First, I was...

559
00:45:28,565 --> 00:45:31,715
wondering what was happening to me,
and then I was...

560
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:34,967
wondering how I could possibly tell you.

561
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:37,409
Tell me what?

562
00:45:41,555 --> 00:45:42,805
I have to leave.

563
00:45:46,416 --> 00:45:47,329
What?

564
00:45:48,032 --> 00:45:49,032
Today.

565
00:45:51,885 --> 00:45:52,885
You can't.

566
00:45:53,174 --> 00:45:54,174
I have to.

567
00:45:56,557 --> 00:46:00,607
When I saw Jordan Chase's body
disappearing into the ocean, I...

568
00:46:01,902 --> 00:46:03,429
Something happened.

569
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,011
And...

570
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:08,617
all night, I was trying to figure out...

571
00:46:09,457 --> 00:46:11,107
what was happening.

572
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,304
And I tried to hold on to it.

573
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:18,278
But...

574
00:46:19,603 --> 00:46:20,903
this morning...

575
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:25,660
I could tell it was gone.

576
00:46:29,248 --> 00:46:30,610
I don't feel it anymore.

577
00:46:33,196 --> 00:46:34,246
The need.

578
00:46:36,056 --> 00:46:38,690
<i>Her dark passenger. It's vanished.</i>

579
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:42,780
Say something.

580
00:46:45,485 --> 00:46:46,485
Please.

581
00:46:49,279 --> 00:46:50,693
Anything. Just...

582
00:46:51,745 --> 00:46:52,745
Just talk to me.

583
00:46:56,096 --> 00:46:57,146
Don't go.

584
00:46:57,691 --> 00:46:58,691
You can't.

585
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:00,594
I don't want to.

586
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,102
Then don't. Stay here.

587
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:07,458
I can't do it anymore,...

588
00:47:08,173 --> 00:47:09,169
what we've been doing.

589
00:47:09,419 --> 00:47:10,819
You don't have to.

590
00:47:11,568 --> 00:47:12,568
But you do.

591
00:47:14,043 --> 00:47:14,995
Right?

592
00:47:17,529 --> 00:47:19,079
We both know that.

593
00:47:25,192 --> 00:47:26,492
It's who you are.

594
00:47:59,522 --> 00:48:01,071
You're right.

595
00:48:05,678 --> 00:48:07,262
About everything, you're right.

596
00:48:13,763 --> 00:48:15,312
We're not the same.

597
00:48:19,419 --> 00:48:20,901
I'm so sorry.

598
00:48:22,404 --> 00:48:23,529
Don't be.

599
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:30,626
Don't be sorry your darkness is gone.

600
00:48:36,866 --> 00:48:38,818
I'll carry it for you.

601
00:48:40,359 --> 00:48:41,386
Always.

602
00:48:46,915 --> 00:48:49,076
I'll keep it with mine.

603
00:49:13,997 --> 00:49:15,852
Happy Birthday, Harrison.

604
00:49:27,293 --> 00:49:29,238
Happy anniversary.

605
00:49:30,913 --> 00:49:32,101
Thank you.

606
00:49:32,405 --> 00:49:34,897
Only it's not our anniversary.

607
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:36,889
I saw you.

608
00:49:37,681 --> 00:49:39,979
With Deb. Trying so hard.

609
00:49:41,841 --> 00:49:43,994
It makes me want to do the same.

610
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:47,445
How 'bout we give it another shot?

611
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:50,354
- Go back to the beginning?
- Yes.

612
00:49:53,004 --> 00:49:54,004
Yes.

613
00:50:09,538 --> 00:50:11,069
Dexterous.

614
00:50:14,188 --> 00:50:17,465
So, Dex, be honest with me.

615
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:21,139
Is it weird to bring a date
to a first birthday party?

616
00:50:22,165 --> 00:50:24,128
No, Vince. I'm...

617
00:50:24,705 --> 00:50:26,572
- glad you brought her.
- Oh, no,...

618
00:50:26,822 --> 00:50:29,927
I didn't mean me.
I meant your sister.

619
00:50:32,574 --> 00:50:36,881
There she is! The detective
who solved the barrel girls case.

620
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:46,713
Thank you.

621
00:50:48,676 --> 00:50:49,715
For what?

622
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,592
The blood work.

623
00:50:52,801 --> 00:50:54,055
Just doing my job.

624
00:50:54,305 --> 00:50:57,240
Yeah, well, that was the one thing
hanging me up.

625
00:50:58,365 --> 00:50:59,559
I owe you one.

626
00:51:03,284 --> 00:51:04,828
I'm gonna go get a drink.

627
00:51:10,054 --> 00:51:12,667
You could have told me sooner
that the blood work cleared him.

628
00:51:12,917 --> 00:51:16,893
Channels. LaGuerta wanted to
give you the good news.

629
00:51:21,075 --> 00:51:22,539
You don't like Quinn much.

630
00:51:23,074 --> 00:51:24,879
I don't like Quinn at all.

631
00:51:26,009 --> 00:51:27,990
But I want you to be happy.

632
00:51:29,484 --> 00:51:31,591
I am. I'm happy.

633
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:35,261
You must be too.

634
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:38,080
Now that this is all over, I mean.

635
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:46,868
<i>They make it look so easy.</i>

636
00:51:52,232 --> 00:51:55,023
<i>Connecting with another human being.</i>

637
00:51:58,807 --> 00:52:02,772
<i>It's like no one told them
it's the hardest thing in the world.</i>

638
00:52:43,956 --> 00:52:44,955
Where is she?

639
00:52:46,495 --> 00:52:48,926
Your tenant.
Who was staying at the house.

640
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,320
She left.

641
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,498
I'm sorry.

642
00:52:56,735 --> 00:52:57,719
Did you do it?

643
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:01,179
What you wanted to do?

644
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,963
You said she needed your help.

645
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:05,684
Did you help her?

646
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:10,173
Yeah. I think I did.

647
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:12,936
And did it work?

648
00:53:14,665 --> 00:53:16,835
Did it make you feel better?

649
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,814
About what happened to mom?

650
00:53:20,479 --> 00:53:24,693
<i>You can't do one thing to make up for another.
That's what Jordan Chase says.</i>

651
00:53:25,485 --> 00:53:28,546
<i>But he's wrong, because
we do that all the time.</i>

652
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,424
<i>That is the way the world works.
We try to make things right.</i>

653
00:53:34,792 --> 00:53:36,485
<i>Even me.</i>

654
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:39,468
Come on, everybody, it's time for the cake.

655
00:53:40,846 --> 00:53:41,720
Dexter.

656
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:48,691
Are you ready?

657
00:53:50,487 --> 00:53:54,533
<i>Lumen said I gave her her life back,
a reversal of my usual role.</i>

658
00:53:54,944 --> 00:53:57,564
<i>Well, the fact is, she
gave me mine back too.</i>

659
00:53:57,852 --> 00:54:01,613
<i>And I'm left not with what she took
from me but with what she brought.</i>

660
00:54:02,524 --> 00:54:06,612
<i>Eyes that saw me, finally,
for who I really am.</i>

661
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:11,276
<i>And this certainty.
That nothing, nothing is set in stone.</i>

662
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:13,329
<i>Not even darkness.</i>

663
00:54:15,308 --> 00:54:17,841
<i>While she was here, she made me think,
for the briefest moment,</i>

664
00:54:18,383 --> 00:54:20,748
<i>that I might even have
a chance to be human.</i>

665
00:54:20,998 --> 00:54:23,269
Make a wish. Make a wish.

666
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:24,833
One...

667
00:54:25,515 --> 00:54:26,230
Two...

668
00:54:26,841 --> 00:54:28,575
- Make a wish.
- Make a wish.

669
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:32,449
<i>But wishes, of course, are for children.</i>

670
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:33,809
Three!
