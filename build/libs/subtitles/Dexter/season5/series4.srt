2
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:48,345
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,513
I think I may have a lead
on Kyle Butler.

4
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:52,414
I didn't know you people
were working this.

5
00:01:52,449 --> 00:01:53,982
The Mitchells are
in a safe house.

6
00:01:54,017 --> 00:01:55,384
I just want to show them
a photo.

7
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:56,485
There is a great, big,

8
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,420
shit-ugly world
out there, Jonah,

9
00:01:58,455 --> 00:02:00,255
what do you want me to do?

10
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,925
- Okay, we had sex.
- Was it good sex?

11
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,994
I've said all I'm gonna say.

12
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:08,497
Lopez collapsed
while on duty today.

13
00:02:08,531 --> 00:02:10,065
He's been hospitalized
with internal bleeding.

14
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,334
Batista could not only
lose his job,

15
00:02:12,368 --> 00:02:13,902
he could serve time.

16
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:16,605
I know who purchased
the Santa Muerte icons.

17
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,841
- What'd you get?
- Two guys in their 30s.

18
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,876
Strong accents, possibly
recent immigrants

19
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,112
from Venezuela.

20
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:25,581
They did this to him because
he started talking to me.

21
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:29,885
Boyd Fowler, division
of dead animal pickup.

22
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,153
Hobbies... storing women
in formaldehyde.

23
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:32,654
We'll do a shift together.

24
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:34,389
Tomorrow morning,
8:00 sharp.

25
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:36,391
An old tourist welcome center.

26
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:39,194
Totally isolated.

27
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:42,498
Oh, I wish you could see
the room I set up for you.

28
00:02:42,532 --> 00:02:44,700
All the women you've killed.

29
00:02:44,734 --> 00:02:47,102
You don't know what
you're getting into.

30
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:56,011
Don't...

31
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,113
she saw everything.

32
00:02:58,148 --> 00:02:59,882
She saw...Me.

33
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:42,324
I'm not liking the trend here.

34
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:44,426
You rip a man apart
in a public bathroom...

35
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,495
No one saw.

36
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:50,432
You nearly botch Boyd's kill.

37
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:51,967
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Yeah.

38
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:54,803
And now you've got her.

39
00:03:54,838 --> 00:03:58,173
What's the first rule
of the code?

40
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,741
Never kill an innocent.

41
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:01,410
Don't get caught.

42
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:05,914
So what's your plan here?

43
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:08,617
Nurse her back to health
so she can go to the police?

44
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:10,485
She gives the cops enough
to track you down,

45
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,687
then everything falls apart.

46
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:14,389
Harrison grows up
visiting you on death row.

47
00:04:21,965 --> 00:04:24,499
Why are you doing this?

48
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:25,834
Because she's dying.

49
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:27,836
And you're a serial killer.

50
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:29,137
I'd think you could
handle that.

51
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:32,040
You didn't do this to her, Dex.

52
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:34,509
She's not your responsibility.

53
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:38,881
Go home and take care
of your son.

54
00:04:51,628 --> 00:04:54,897
It's okay. Don't move.

55
00:04:59,302 --> 00:05:01,937
Everything will be okay.

56
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,842
Don't! It's okay.
It's okay!

57
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:10,545
Calm down.

58
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,214
Stop fighting me.

59
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:16,919
I'm not here to hurt you.
Stop!

60
00:05:49,786 --> 00:05:52,754
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

61
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:06,969
What?

62
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:09,538
Jesus.
What's your problem?

63
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:11,073
Sorry. It's the middle
of the night.

64
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:12,941
In California, maybe.
What's wrong with you?

65
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:15,444
Nothing.
I'm just...Tired.

66
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:16,945
You are?

67
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,081
I just pulled an all-nighter
at a crime scene.

68
00:06:19,115 --> 00:06:21,049
Totally fried
and I've got Jack shit.

69
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:23,652
So the babysitter's
been there all night?

70
00:06:23,686 --> 00:06:26,221
Masuka's trying.
He really is.

71
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:27,723
But the blood just
doesn't talk to him

72
00:06:27,757 --> 00:06:29,725
the way it does to you.

73
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,593
I really need your help
on this.

74
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:34,329
It's not a good time.
I've got Harrison.

75
00:06:34,364 --> 00:06:35,764
Well, what happened
to the babysitter?

76
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:37,532
Probably getting ready
to kill me.

77
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,167
Look, I know you're still
on leave,

78
00:06:39,202 --> 00:06:41,003
and you know I wouldn't ask
if it weren't important.

79
00:06:41,037 --> 00:06:42,104
Don't make me beg.

80
00:06:42,138 --> 00:06:44,439
Deb, look, it's...

81
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:46,842
Maybe I can use the crime scene
to get an I.D.

82
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:49,678
On sleeping beauty here.

83
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:52,614
Okay, I'll do it.
You will?

84
00:06:52,648 --> 00:06:56,518
Yeah. Of course.

85
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:58,887
You're my sister.

86
00:06:58,921 --> 00:07:01,690
Where, uh...
where should I go?

87
00:07:01,724 --> 00:07:04,860
1132 Moredo.
It's a Botanica.

88
00:07:04,894 --> 00:07:08,163
Just follow the fucking
news vans.

89
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:09,865
You're t best, you know that?

90
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:14,102
Hello?

91
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:46,001
Dex, over here.

92
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:47,402
You're just in time.

93
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:49,638
The coroner's chomping
at the bit to remove the body.

94
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:50,672
It's a bit of a circus.

95
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:51,973
Are you kidding me?
It's Barnum and Bailey.

96
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,411
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're working on it!

97
00:07:56,446 --> 00:07:57,779
- What's he saying?
- I have no idea.

98
00:07:57,814 --> 00:07:59,347
But the general complaint is
there are fewer beheadings

99
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:00,348
in the rich parts of Miami.

100
00:08:00,383 --> 00:08:01,683
Beheadings?

101
00:08:01,717 --> 00:08:06,354
Yeah. And that's not even
the fucked up part.

102
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:14,396
- Dextrous.
- Vince.

103
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,466
Whoa, you weren't kidding
about the fucked up part.

104
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,536
It's a potential witness.
And it's the second this week.

105
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:22,871
So what you got?

106
00:08:22,905 --> 00:08:25,207
Uh, we're thinking machete.

107
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:27,709
Okay. What else?

108
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:29,144
Just machete.

109
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:31,179
We've been up all night.
We're too tired to think.

110
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:35,617
That's why I called you.

111
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:38,753
So?

112
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:41,823
So the beheading obviously
went down here.

113
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:45,527
He was standing.

114
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:49,764
Whack one,
and the victim goes down.

115
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,999
Whack two...

116
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:53,835
Whack three...

117
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,506
And cervical vertebrae
are pretty much toast.

118
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,475
Separation complete.

119
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,310
We have liftoff.
That's what I've been saying.

120
00:09:02,345 --> 00:09:04,646
Not really.
Let him work.

121
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,515
Eyes and tongue removed here.

122
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:09,251
Tongue's in the ice chest.
Do you want to see it?

123
00:09:09,285 --> 00:09:11,786
No, not really.

124
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:13,855
Has anyone been smoking
in here?

125
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,191
It's 2010. Who smokes?

126
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:18,660
Uh, machete man, I think.

127
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,835
A small cigar.

128
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:28,904
Highly unstable ash.

129
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:32,274
Short, torn tobacco leaves.
It's a cheap one.

130
00:09:32,308 --> 00:09:34,376
Like a tiparillo.

131
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,413
I'd look for that.

132
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:42,584
So machete and tiparillo.
Definitely stylin'.

133
00:09:42,618 --> 00:09:44,352
Fuck me in both ears.

134
00:09:44,387 --> 00:09:48,190
Okay, people, our killers left
through that door

135
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:49,391
into the alley.

136
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:51,293
So let's sweep it
for small cigar butts.

137
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:52,627
Hey, watch your step, fellas.

138
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:54,162
Watch the ev.
Watch the ev!

139
00:09:54,197 --> 00:09:56,698
Thank you.
Watch the ev.

140
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:05,707
So...That, uh,
cigar ash stuff...

141
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:08,543
- Yeah?
- You learn that in grad school?

142
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:10,445
Uh, Havana room.

143
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:14,583
Havana room.

144
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:17,619
Oh, good to have you back.

145
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:21,456
You know, in a supporting role.

146
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,392
Assisting...Me.
Yeah. Thanks.

147
00:10:24,427 --> 00:10:25,760
I gotta go.

148
00:10:25,795 --> 00:10:28,263
Don't you want to see
if we find the cigar?

149
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:30,065
I just want to find out
who that girl is

150
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:32,300
before the m-99
wears off.

151
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:33,668
Absolutely.

152
00:10:33,703 --> 00:10:37,072
I'll drop by the station later.

153
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:49,651
Oh...He's up.

154
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:52,020
He's been up for hours.

155
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:55,757
I know.
I missed you too.

156
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,326
I'm so sorry.
I know I'm late.

157
00:10:58,361 --> 00:10:59,928
<i>Late doesn't quite
capture it.</i>

158
00:10:59,962 --> 00:11:01,763
It's been all night.

159
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:03,331
I know, it's just...

160
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:04,833
I killed a man
in front of a witness

161
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:06,368
I just had to tranquilize

162
00:11:06,402 --> 00:11:08,837
to keep her
from scratching my eyes out.

163
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:11,106
- What?
- I'll make it up to you.

164
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,274
I don't think so.

165
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:13,875
What's that mean?

166
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:16,077
It means I don't think
this is a good fit,

167
00:11:16,112 --> 00:11:17,279
and I won't be returning.

168
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:18,980
It is.
It is a good fit.

169
00:11:19,015 --> 00:11:21,716
Harrison likes you.
And I really like him.

170
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:24,185
Which is what pains me
so much about this, but...

171
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,154
He needs a reliable parent.

172
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:27,889
Especially with his mother
gone.

173
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:29,291
I'm reliable.

174
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:31,159
Well, I guess we use
different dictionaries.

175
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:33,328
- It will never happen again.
- Do you think?

176
00:11:33,362 --> 00:11:36,231
My mother told me
when I was just a little girl,

177
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:38,533
"never lie to someone
who trusts you.

178
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:41,202
Never trust someone
who lies to you."

179
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:42,904
It's a shame, really.

180
00:11:42,938 --> 00:11:46,007
We got off
to such a good start.

181
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:53,548
I miss your mom.

182
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:58,753
? ?

183
00:11:58,788 --> 00:12:01,323
I understand that,
but the bureau said no.

184
00:12:01,357 --> 00:12:05,427
Even though the only clue
you have in the trinity case

185
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:07,162
is Kyle Butler,
and I might know who that is.

186
00:12:07,196 --> 00:12:08,330
That's right.

187
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:10,098
- Ask again, ray.
- There's no point.

188
00:12:10,132 --> 00:12:12,334
I thought you had clout.

189
00:12:12,368 --> 00:12:14,235
Not when it comes
to doing an end run

190
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,304
on safe house procedures.

191
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:18,340
Look, offer still stands.

192
00:12:18,374 --> 00:12:20,241
Give me the photo,
I'll show it to the family.

193
00:12:20,276 --> 00:12:23,511
I told you, I can't do that.
It's a sensitive situation.

194
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:25,347
It's your call.

195
00:12:25,381 --> 00:12:29,684
Great. Thanks.

196
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:34,556
Here we go.

197
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:58,179
There's the safe house,

198
00:12:58,214 --> 00:13:02,484
and there's Jonah Mitchell.

199
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:10,425
Okay, we may have finally
caught a break

200
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:12,627
in the Santa Muerte case,
so listen up, people.

201
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:13,928
Detective Morgan.

202
00:13:13,963 --> 00:13:15,363
Okay, it's too soon
to celebrate,

203
00:13:15,398 --> 00:13:18,233
and most of us are
too fucking tired anyway,

204
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:21,236
but we found this
just outside the back entrance

205
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,104
of the Botanica
where Fauzi was murdered.

206
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:26,107
Is that a cigar butt?

207
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:27,275
Very perceptive,
Detective Quinn.

208
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:29,744
And may I thank you for
getting your lazy ass

209
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,579
off the couch and joining us...
so thank you.

210
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:33,882
It's a tiparillo butt,

211
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,116
and we have reason to believe
it was handled

212
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:36,918
by one of the two assailants.

213
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:38,420
So what are we talking about,
DNA swab?

214
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:40,821
Even better.

215
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:45,526
Oh, there's a 3/4 partial
thumbprint on the side,

216
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,728
and it has to be processed
manually... it's incomplete.

217
00:13:47,763 --> 00:13:51,065
But we expect to hear back
within a day.

218
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:53,901
And there's the man
we have to thank for it...

219
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:55,770
my nephew Harrison.

220
00:13:55,804 --> 00:13:58,239
He lent us his dad.

221
00:13:58,273 --> 00:14:00,441
Look at those cheeks!
May I?

222
00:14:00,475 --> 00:14:01,742
Sure.

223
00:14:04,646 --> 00:14:06,614
You look like your mommy.

224
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:08,416
Oh, and he's got daddy's eyes.

225
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,651
- And your penis size.
- No, it's bigger.

226
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:12,853
It's much bigger.

227
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:18,159
Who would have thought?
Better than doughnuts.

228
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:25,232
This your idea of quality time,

229
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:27,468
using your son as cover?

230
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:29,704
He's enjoying it.
They're enjoying it.

231
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:30,972
It's a win-win.

232
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:32,907
Besides, it's for a good cause.

233
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,675
I need to find out
who this girl is

234
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,512
before she wakes up,
which will be soon.

235
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:44,819
Ah, damn it.

236
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:49,123
Come on, come on...

237
00:15:02,437 --> 00:15:03,838
What are you doing now,

238
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:06,340
stealing from a co-worker?

239
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,342
Borrowing.

240
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:09,710
You really thing
Vince Masuka won't notice

241
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:11,812
half his medicine cabinet
is missing?

242
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:14,181
I don't care.
He's a hypochondriac.

243
00:15:14,216 --> 00:15:17,018
She actually needs this stuff.

244
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,195
Lumen Ann Pierce,

245
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,730
from Minnesota.

246
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:33,334
No warrants.
Not even a traffic violation.

247
00:15:33,368 --> 00:15:35,569
Yeah, and no missing persons
report either.

248
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:37,338
No one's looking for her.

249
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:38,939
What are you saying,
I should just let her die?

250
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:40,374
Well, you can't just
let her go.

251
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:46,981
This isn't some fairy tale
where she wakes up

252
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:49,150
and you get to be the handsome
prince who saved her.

253
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:51,018
If she wakes up,
she'll call the police.

254
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:52,853
You think I don't know that?

255
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,257
How you doing?

256
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:18,279
Hey, isn't it about time
for his nap?

257
00:16:18,313 --> 00:16:19,380
Yeah.

258
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:21,282
Oh, I know the feeling.

259
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:24,118
You do?
I flatlined hours ago.

260
00:16:24,152 --> 00:16:25,486
I'm heading home to take a nap.

261
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,822
Hey, will you do me a favor
and take him with you?

262
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:30,391
I've got someone expecting me.

263
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:33,661
- What about the nanny?
- She needed a break.

264
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:34,829
After two days?

265
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:36,797
It would be a huge help.

266
00:16:36,832 --> 00:16:38,732
And he's gonna go
right to sleep.

267
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:41,802
He's way overdue for a nap.

268
00:16:41,837 --> 00:16:43,170
All right.
If you carry him to the car.

269
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:47,174
He's getting heavy.

270
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:48,943
Angel.

271
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:55,382
- What's this?
- An address.

272
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:56,817
I didn't want to give it to you
in front of everybody else.

273
00:16:56,852 --> 00:16:57,918
- It's a hospital.
- Mm-hmm.

274
00:16:57,953 --> 00:17:00,354
That's where sergeant Lopez
ended up

275
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:01,989
after your little fight.

276
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:04,592
You need to go apologize.
No. No.

277
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:05,926
No.

278
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:07,695
He's the one that should
apologize to me.

279
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:10,064
He's the one who has
a broken nose,

280
00:17:10,098 --> 00:17:12,500
a broken rib,
and a punctured lung.

281
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:13,601
Angel.

282
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:14,802
I should have broken his jaw

283
00:17:14,836 --> 00:17:15,936
for what he said about you.

284
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:17,805
I'm not gonna argue with you.

285
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,607
Internal affairs
is coming by tomorrow,

286
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:21,108
and they need to know
that it's over.

287
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:26,680
That there's no bad blood
between you, okay?

288
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:29,016
I'm not asking.

289
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:49,570
Sorry if I scared you before.

290
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:52,339
Maybe we can start again?

291
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:58,979
You probably have a headache.

292
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:00,748
The sedative does that.

293
00:18:00,782 --> 00:18:03,817
I got you aspirin for it.

294
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:06,587
Also antibiotics.

295
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:08,055
You have a pretty
serious fever.

296
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:10,157
They'll help bring that down.

297
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:11,959
I'm not trying to drug you.

298
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:13,527
They really are just
antibiotics.

299
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:20,668
See?

300
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:31,912
You're dehydrated.
Can you drink?

301
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:39,353
Careful, careful, careful.

302
00:18:39,387 --> 00:18:42,223
I'm not gonna hurt you.

303
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:48,295
Where am I?

304
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,798
A safe place.

305
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:52,600
Far from Boyd.

306
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:57,605
I'm...
Not taking anything.

307
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,713
What's your name?

308
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:13,887
Look, you really need
to talk to me.

309
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:17,858
Rachel.

310
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:21,929
Okay.

311
00:19:21,963 --> 00:19:26,567
Rachel...
I'm not gonna hurt you.

312
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:28,068
I just want to see you
get better.

313
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:33,941
Why didn't you take me
to the hospital?

314
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:35,943
You know why.

315
00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:39,313
No, I don't.

316
00:19:39,347 --> 00:19:43,284
Because you saw me...

317
00:19:43,318 --> 00:19:48,222
In the house.

318
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:50,791
I didn't see anything.

319
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:53,394
We both know that's not true.

320
00:19:53,428 --> 00:19:57,831
I would never tell anyone.

321
00:19:57,866 --> 00:20:01,935
Please...
Let me go.

322
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,438
I can't.

323
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,212
What are you gonna do with me?

324
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:14,915
Nothing.

325
00:20:14,949 --> 00:20:18,585
Are you...Gonna sell me?

326
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,754
Sell you? No.

327
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:24,992
Then what are you gonna do?

328
00:20:25,026 --> 00:20:26,560
Nothing.
I'm not gonna do anything.

329
00:20:26,594 --> 00:20:28,562
I'm not lying.

330
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:30,397
Look, you can't even
think straight

331
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:31,965
with a fever like that.

332
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,202
You need to take these.

333
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:46,413
No, no, no, no.
No, stay away from me!

334
00:20:46,448 --> 00:20:48,349
Stay away from me!
I'm trying to help you.

335
00:20:48,383 --> 00:20:50,651
- Let me out! Let me out!
- I can't do that.

336
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:52,786
No, please, let me go.

337
00:20:52,821 --> 00:20:55,122
I can't... I can't...

338
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:58,058
I can't go through it again!

339
00:20:58,093 --> 00:21:00,461
Just kill me now.

340
00:21:00,495 --> 00:21:02,996
Please!

341
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:08,902
Harry's right.

342
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:10,838
I need a plan.

343
00:21:26,588 --> 00:21:27,888
How you doing, Lopez?

344
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:30,124
How's it look like I'm doing?

345
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:33,260
Listen, the other night,

346
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:35,562
we both had a little
too much to drink.

347
00:21:35,597 --> 00:21:41,135
And, um...
When you insulted my wife,

348
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:44,405
I just saw red.

349
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:45,939
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,712
I'm not the first guy
to take a swing at you.

351
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:53,180
Are you really gonna
bust my chops

352
00:21:53,214 --> 00:21:55,382
with I.A. Over this?

353
00:21:58,953 --> 00:22:00,754
You know that line
between a few

354
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:02,189
and a few too many?

355
00:22:02,223 --> 00:22:03,590
All too well.

356
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,427
<i>Yeah, well, I had
way too many that night.</i>

357
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:10,230
And I should have
held my temper, but I didn't.

358
00:22:10,265 --> 00:22:13,934
<i>And I apologize.
Lo siento.</i>

359
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:16,703
I don't know what else to say.

360
00:22:18,406 --> 00:22:20,274
So are we okay or what?

361
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:23,710
You're okay.

362
00:22:23,745 --> 00:22:26,113
I'm in a fucking hospital.

363
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,023
No...We're okay.

364
00:22:36,057 --> 00:22:38,525
I'm not gonna press charges,
Batista.

365
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,294
Now get the fuck out
of my room.

366
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:52,206
The babysitter doesn't trust me

367
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,507
because of the lies.

368
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:57,244
Lumen doesn't trust me
because of the truth.

369
00:22:58,613 --> 00:23:02,149
There must be a name for that.

370
00:23:02,183 --> 00:23:05,752
Oh, right, Dexter Morgan...

371
00:23:05,787 --> 00:23:08,322
The problem is lumen knows
way too much about me,

372
00:23:08,356 --> 00:23:11,091
and I know nothing about her.

373
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:14,328
Hmm, an unpaid motel bill.

374
00:23:14,362 --> 00:23:15,462
I was hoping for more,

375
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:18,899
but at least
it's a place to start.

376
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:23,770
Hey, how was your nap?
What nap?

377
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:25,472
He woke up the second
we got back.

378
00:23:25,507 --> 00:23:27,341
Oh. Sorry.

379
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:30,177
Fix you something to eat?

380
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:31,612
I'm too tired to chew.

381
00:23:31,646 --> 00:23:34,281
Damn it, Dexter!

382
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:35,349
What? What is it?

383
00:23:35,383 --> 00:23:38,619
Nothing. It's just...

384
00:23:38,653 --> 00:23:42,489
What is this?

385
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:44,024
It's a little toy keyboard.

386
00:23:44,058 --> 00:23:46,727
No, I mean why
am I sitting on it?

387
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:48,262
Why are we living like this?

388
00:23:48,296 --> 00:23:51,832
Between the baby stuff
and your stuff and my stuff,

389
00:23:51,866 --> 00:23:53,000
which I can barely see anymore,

390
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:54,535
I feel like a fucking refugee.

391
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:57,604
I get it. I get it.

392
00:23:57,639 --> 00:24:01,675
Okay...

393
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:05,979
You need some peace and quiet.

394
00:24:06,014 --> 00:24:07,147
We'll head out for a while.

395
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:10,551
Where are you going?

396
00:24:49,123 --> 00:24:50,557
So what can I do for you?

397
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:51,825
Uh, I'm not sure.

398
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:54,628
I think my wife...
his mom...

399
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:56,496
might have left
her luggage here.

400
00:24:56,531 --> 00:24:58,265
Lumen Pierce.

401
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:00,534
- Let's have a look-see.
Can you spell that, please?

402
00:25:00,568 --> 00:25:03,604
- Yeah, it's p-I-e-r-c-e.

403
00:25:03,638 --> 00:25:05,839
The other name.
The weird one. No offense.

404
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:09,610
- Uh, lumen.
L-u-m-e-n.

405
00:25:12,213 --> 00:25:14,081
- Mm-hmm.

406
00:25:14,115 --> 00:25:15,415
I remember her.

407
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:19,419
Your wife prepaid two weeks.
It's been over a month.

408
00:25:19,454 --> 00:25:21,555
Change of plans.
We ended up staying with friends

409
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:22,789
in north beach.

410
00:25:22,824 --> 00:25:24,358
Well, she never checked out.

411
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:27,527
We sent her file
to a collection agency.

412
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:29,329
Oh, gee, it'd be a lot simpler

413
00:25:29,364 --> 00:25:31,231
if you'd just let me
take care of it.

414
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:33,333
Oh, do you, by any chance,
still have her luggage?

415
00:25:33,368 --> 00:25:35,435
Yeah, in storage.

416
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,205
I'd appreciate it.
We both would.

417
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:39,906
$320 and we're square.

418
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:44,611
Okay.

419
00:25:48,216 --> 00:25:50,050
Put your John Hancock here,

420
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:51,985
and I'll go fetch
your wife's luggage.

421
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,587
Great.

422
00:25:56,124 --> 00:25:58,659
Ten months old and you've had
your first cigarette.

423
00:25:58,693 --> 00:26:00,761
Sorry about that.

424
00:26:23,051 --> 00:26:24,317
"Dear lumen,

425
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:28,388
"I know it feels like
the end of the world right now,

426
00:26:28,423 --> 00:26:31,925
"but it's not.

427
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:34,961
"I understand why you felt
you had to leave.

428
00:26:34,996 --> 00:26:39,132
"And believe me, you have
nothing to be ashamed of.

429
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:41,435
"And as for your father,

430
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:43,637
"I know he said things
he regrets,

431
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:45,405
"even though he'll
never admit it.

432
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:50,510
"We miss you.
We love you.

433
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:52,713
"Take all the time you need,

434
00:26:52,747 --> 00:26:54,648
"but then please come home.

435
00:26:54,682 --> 00:26:56,450
"It's not a family without you.

436
00:26:56,484 --> 00:26:58,085
Love, mom."

437
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:21,141
Dexter.

438
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:22,676
Oh, sorry.

439
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,545
I woke you up.
I was trying to be quiet.

440
00:27:29,717 --> 00:27:32,252
You were gone a long time.
I was worried about you.

441
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:34,821
Just went for a little drive.

442
00:27:34,856 --> 00:27:36,723
Sorry about before.

443
00:27:36,758 --> 00:27:40,694
And in case you didn't know,

444
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:43,930
you and Harrison are
the most important people to me.

445
00:27:43,965 --> 00:27:46,600
You're the only
important people.

446
00:27:46,634 --> 00:27:48,401
You guys can stay here forever.

447
00:27:48,436 --> 00:27:50,837
I don't care about the mess.

448
00:27:50,872 --> 00:27:53,373
I'm the fucking slob
in the family anyway.

449
00:27:57,211 --> 00:27:58,712
You want a beer?

450
00:27:58,746 --> 00:28:01,681
Yeah.

451
00:28:01,716 --> 00:28:05,952
I would love a beer.

452
00:28:24,772 --> 00:28:27,274
Mr. Morgan.

453
00:28:27,308 --> 00:28:30,410
Please give us another chance.

454
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:31,878
I don't think it's a good idea.

455
00:28:31,913 --> 00:28:33,079
I know I screwed up.

456
00:28:33,114 --> 00:28:35,315
There's no need to apologize.

457
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:36,683
Harrison is a wonderful child,

458
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:37,717
and you will have no trouble

459
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:38,952
finding someone else
to watch him.

460
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:40,787
I don't want someone else
to watch him.

461
00:28:40,822 --> 00:28:42,656
- Well, I'm flattered...
- And I heard you.

462
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,959
About how you need
to be able to trust me.

463
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:51,531
What I said was
I don't trust you.

464
00:28:57,505 --> 00:29:00,173
Look, there was an emergency.

465
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:04,044
A girl was badly hurt.
She was very near death.

466
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:05,478
I spent the night trying
to help her,

467
00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:07,647
and then I was called
to a crime scene by my sister.

468
00:29:07,682 --> 00:29:12,085
That's...Where I was.
Really.

469
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:17,324
And I'm here now because
we interviewed 30 people,

470
00:29:17,358 --> 00:29:19,492
and you're the one...

471
00:29:19,527 --> 00:29:21,862
Who didn't scare me, basically.

472
00:29:21,896 --> 00:29:24,397
You're the only one
I could trust Harrison to.

473
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:31,705
Well, you are holding him
a little bit like a football.

474
00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:35,809
Oh...
What do they call it?

475
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:37,210
A leap of faith.

476
00:29:37,245 --> 00:29:41,381
I guess it's one
on both our parts.

477
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:47,254
One more chance, Mr. Morgan,
but that's it.

478
00:29:47,288 --> 00:29:52,626
Look at this.

479
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,196
- Look at what?
- Notice anything missing?

480
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,397
How would I know?

481
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:59,799
Somebody's been dipping
into my meds,

482
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:02,068
and methinks me knows who.

483
00:30:02,103 --> 00:30:05,205
Yeah, uh, Dexter was
back here alone yesterday.

484
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:06,339
I don't know, maybe it was him.

485
00:30:06,374 --> 00:30:08,875
No motive, Detective.

486
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,012
You, on the other hand,
have been getting down and dirty

487
00:30:12,046 --> 00:30:14,214
with the hottest potty mouth
in the south.

488
00:30:14,248 --> 00:30:17,951
Now, I appreciate you taking
preventative measures

489
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:20,620
so as not to pass on
whatever sick scurvy

490
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:21,955
you may carry on to her.

491
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:23,390
Mm.

492
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:28,395
I'm willing to share.

493
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:31,164
All you have to do is ask.

494
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:34,200
Okay, I didn't take your meds.

495
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:39,339
And I'm not getting
down and dirty with Debra.

496
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:41,541
Okay?

497
00:30:44,445 --> 00:30:46,780
May I just say that
I admire your chivalry?

498
00:30:46,814 --> 00:30:50,583
It's a rare man
who won't kiss and tell.

499
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,089
Make sure you get
the names and numbers...

500
00:30:58,092 --> 00:30:59,159
Get back to me when you finish.

501
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:01,094
- Mm-hmm.
- Excuse me.

502
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:06,967
McCourt...

503
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:09,569
Just wanted to let you know
that I paid sergeant Lopez

504
00:31:09,603 --> 00:31:11,037
a visit yesterday.

505
00:31:11,072 --> 00:31:12,105
So I heard.

506
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:13,907
I apologized, he accepted.

507
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:15,141
We're Jake.
It's all good.

508
00:31:15,176 --> 00:31:17,544
Hey, you put a cop
in the hospital.

509
00:31:17,578 --> 00:31:19,479
What happens now
is up to the department,

510
00:31:19,513 --> 00:31:21,581
not him.

511
00:31:21,615 --> 00:31:23,616
Meaning what?

512
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:25,885
Fact is,
it's assault and battery

513
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,954
against a fellow officer.

514
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:32,092
It's a few punches against
a drunken loudmouth.

515
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:33,793
Good morning, Jim.

516
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:35,495
- Lieutenant.
- You mean to tell me

517
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:37,263
you have nothing
more important to do

518
00:31:37,298 --> 00:31:38,698
than to investigate
a bar fight?

519
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:40,000
How's the time line coming
on the Santa Muerte case?

520
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:42,635
The time line's just fine.

521
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,636
I'm due upstairs in 20 minutes,

522
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:45,739
so we should get going.

523
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:47,474
Would you like some coffee?

524
00:31:47,508 --> 00:31:49,442
That would be wonderful.

525
00:31:53,147 --> 00:31:54,614
My husband's not wrong,
you know.

526
00:31:54,648 --> 00:31:56,816
- How's that?
- Well, considering the fact

527
00:31:56,851 --> 00:31:58,118
that the other officer
involved...

528
00:31:58,152 --> 00:32:00,620
The assault victim.

529
00:32:00,654 --> 00:32:02,122
It was just a bar fight, Jim.

530
00:32:02,156 --> 00:32:07,293
Now, you and I both know
they happen all the time.

531
00:32:07,328 --> 00:32:09,896
Okay, I'm wondering
what can end this.

532
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,599
See, I'm more interested
in what started it.

533
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:17,504
Because according
to sergeant Lopez's deposition,

534
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:21,775
he said, drunkenly,
that you give the best blow job

535
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:25,512
in Miami.

536
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:30,283
Is that part
of the official record?

537
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:32,385
Should it be?

538
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:46,466
Hey, good news.

539
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,201
Masuka found a match
on that partial print

540
00:32:48,235 --> 00:32:50,837
we had from the cigar butt.

541
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:54,707
Or are you no longer interested
in solving homicides?

542
00:32:54,742 --> 00:32:57,310
- Huh?
- Carlos Fuentes.

543
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,179
You're gonna love this.
He's got a brother. Marco.

544
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:01,181
They live together,
and I got the address.

545
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:02,882
Two of them.

546
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:04,617
Does that sound like
what we've been looking for,

547
00:33:04,652 --> 00:33:06,352
or does that sound like
what we've been looking for?

548
00:33:06,387 --> 00:33:09,022
I'll get a team together.
Let's get these guys.

549
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:10,490
And where's Quinn again?

550
00:33:10,524 --> 00:33:11,524
Fucknose is gonna miss
the party.

551
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:16,196
I have no idea.
Who knows?

552
00:33:20,701 --> 00:33:22,569
Fuck.

553
00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:40,487
Hold on. Hold on.

554
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:41,955
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

555
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:44,991
Okay, go.

556
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:47,127
Go, go, go, go.

557
00:33:51,932 --> 00:33:54,567
Morgan, you, you, you.

558
00:33:54,602 --> 00:33:55,969
The other end of the hall.

559
00:33:56,003 --> 00:33:57,070
You, upstairs.

560
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:02,475
- Freeze!
- No, no, no.

561
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,777
We want Fuentes.
Let him go. Let him go.

562
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:06,713
Go!

563
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:14,454
? ?

564
00:34:17,158 --> 00:34:20,593
? ?

565
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:23,329
Open up. Police.

566
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:30,937
<i>Police. Policia!</i>

567
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,407
Nobody move.

568
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:36,743
Holy shit.

569
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:41,481
We want these guys.

570
00:34:41,515 --> 00:34:43,816
Fuentes. Fuentes.

571
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:45,251
Fuentes.

572
00:35:24,692 --> 00:35:25,858
You cut him and I'll blow
your fucking head off.

573
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:27,493
You hear me?

574
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:30,697
Let him go.

575
00:35:30,731 --> 00:35:32,699
- You let him go!
- Everybody clear?

576
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:34,634
Report in.
Diaz, clear.

577
00:35:34,668 --> 00:35:37,503
- Manson, clear.
- Respond.

578
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:39,138
Detective Morgan, you clear?

579
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:44,877
Yes, clear.

580
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:49,315
You stupid bitch.

581
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,185
Aah...Help.

582
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:55,555
Medic!

583
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:58,758
I need a fucking medic!

584
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:29,522
Don't you dare let him die.

585
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:34,994
You okay?

586
00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:36,529
Fine.

587
00:36:36,563 --> 00:36:39,432
Fuck, I should have shot Fuentes
when I had the chance!

588
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:41,434
- And risk killing that kid?
- He might die anyway.

589
00:36:41,468 --> 00:36:42,702
And he might live,
thanks to you.

590
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:45,238
We nearly caught those fucks.
You did good.

591
00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:48,241
You weren't there.

592
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:56,382
Lumen Ann Pierce, from Minnesota.

593
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:00,953
If I can get the crotchety
judgmental babysitter

594
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:03,990
from Ireland to trust me,

595
00:37:04,024 --> 00:37:05,825
I say why not you?

596
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:26,746
- Hyah!
- Unh!

597
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,549
Ouch.

598
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:24,203
Aah!

599
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,589
Stop! Stop! Help me!

600
00:38:43,624 --> 00:38:47,927
Help! Help me!

601
00:38:47,961 --> 00:38:49,796
Do you need a ride?

602
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:52,832
Yeah, what are you doing
out here?

603
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:55,334
Hey, where are you going?

604
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:58,271
Man, she is fucked up!

605
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,178
Aah! No! No!

606
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:06,579
No! No!
Lumen...

607
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:08,648
- No! No!
- Lumen. Lumen

608
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:10,249
lumen, lumen...

609
00:39:10,284 --> 00:39:13,386
Would you stop?
Stop.

610
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,620
Would you stop!

611
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:17,523
Shh...

612
00:39:46,854 --> 00:39:49,522
You know how close
you came back there?

613
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:53,159
If she'd gotten in that car,
it would have been all over.

614
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:55,094
Where are we going?

615
00:39:55,128 --> 00:39:58,464
Believe me,
she will never trust you.

616
00:39:58,499 --> 00:39:59,465
Where are you taking me?

617
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,933
First rule of the code, Dexter,

618
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:02,201
don't get caught.

619
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:03,503
And you're out of options now.

620
00:40:03,537 --> 00:40:05,571
- Let me go.
- She's left you no choice.

621
00:40:05,606 --> 00:40:07,373
Quiet.

622
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:29,661
? ?

623
00:40:36,737 --> 00:40:37,803
Jonah?

624
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:40,973
Hey. Don't be afraid.
I'm a cop.

625
00:40:41,008 --> 00:40:42,341
Miami Metro.
Do I know you?

626
00:40:42,376 --> 00:40:46,279
I think I know
who Kyle Butler is.

627
00:40:46,313 --> 00:40:50,216
Do you recognize this man?

628
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,451
Why do you want to know?

629
00:40:52,486 --> 00:40:54,353
Is this Kyle Butler?

630
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:55,721
Hey, back away!
Back away!

631
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:57,056
I'm a cop. It's okay.

632
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,057
Keep your hands where
I can fuckin' see 'em,

633
00:40:58,091 --> 00:40:59,191
and shut the hell up.

634
00:40:59,226 --> 00:41:01,327
Jonah, go to the car now.

635
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:04,363
Turn around.

636
00:41:47,107 --> 00:41:49,208
Come on. Move.

637
00:41:49,242 --> 00:41:52,845
Please...Don't!

638
00:41:52,879 --> 00:41:55,948
Just move.

639
00:41:55,983 --> 00:41:58,084
What are you gonna do?

640
00:41:58,118 --> 00:42:00,653
Oh...Oh...

641
00:42:08,962 --> 00:42:10,863
- Look at this.
- No! No, no.

642
00:42:10,897 --> 00:42:12,365
Look.

643
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:16,902
This is what happened
to the girls before you.

644
00:42:16,937 --> 00:42:20,439
This is what was gonna
happen to you.

645
00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:23,876
Every one of these barrels
has a body in it.

646
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,511
Boyd preserved them
in formaldehyde

647
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:26,946
so he could come and visit.

648
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,049
Do you understand?

649
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:32,284
I saved your life.

650
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:39,592
How do I know that
you didn't kill these girls?

651
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:45,431
You don't.

652
00:42:50,637 --> 00:42:55,741
It's a leap of faith...
For both of us.

653
00:43:01,648 --> 00:43:04,517
My wife was murdered...

654
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:10,389
Brutally...
By someone like Boyd.

655
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:13,993
I don't want to see any more
innocent people die.

656
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:19,598
Here, you don't believe me?
Take it.

657
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:21,233
No.

658
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:28,407
Take it. It's yours.

659
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:30,743
Oh...

660
00:43:37,184 --> 00:43:39,251
Aah!

661
00:43:44,991 --> 00:43:47,760
Are you done?

662
00:44:07,347 --> 00:44:11,450
I tell you to leave
trinity's family alone,

663
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:14,253
and instead,
you go behind my back.

664
00:44:14,287 --> 00:44:16,956
And based on what? This?

665
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,023
A cut-and-paste sketch

666
00:44:18,058 --> 00:44:19,658
you think resembles
Dexter Morgan?

667
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:21,594
The kid recognized him.

668
00:44:21,628 --> 00:44:22,928
He identified Dexter
as Kyle Butler?

669
00:44:22,963 --> 00:44:25,164
He didn't get a chance,
but I could tell.

670
00:44:25,198 --> 00:44:26,665
<i>Oh, you could tell.</i>

671
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,368
And did Jonah convey this I.D.
To the FBI?

672
00:44:29,402 --> 00:44:31,871
- No.
- Right.

673
00:44:31,905 --> 00:44:35,040
Because it's bullshit.

674
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:37,443
You have your suspicions,
you come to me.

675
00:44:37,477 --> 00:44:40,012
- I tried.
- And when I say no, Quinn,

676
00:44:40,046 --> 00:44:42,648
it's over!

677
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:47,620
You're on unpaid suspension
until further notice.

678
00:44:47,654 --> 00:44:49,488
Suspension?

679
00:44:49,523 --> 00:44:51,557
Just tell everyone you're
taking a few vacation days.

680
00:44:51,591 --> 00:44:53,993
You kidding?

681
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:56,195
Am I fucking kidding?

682
00:44:56,229 --> 00:44:58,964
You're lucky I don't
terminate your ass.

683
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:00,966
And you know the one reason
I don't?

684
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:02,902
Because there'd be
a mandatory hearing,

685
00:45:02,936 --> 00:45:06,372
and this whole embarrassment
would become a matter of record.

686
00:45:09,142 --> 00:45:10,843
No one needs to hear
about your stupid theories.

687
00:45:10,877 --> 00:45:15,614
It would tear
this department apart.

688
00:45:15,649 --> 00:45:16,749
Understood?

689
00:45:16,783 --> 00:45:20,019
Sure.

690
00:45:20,053 --> 00:45:22,688
He just lost his wife,
for chrissakes!

691
00:45:35,035 --> 00:45:37,970
Hey, skeezey...

692
00:45:38,004 --> 00:45:40,239
Where you been all day?

693
00:45:40,273 --> 00:45:43,375
Very long, fucked up story.

694
00:45:46,813 --> 00:45:49,582
I heard about the raid.

695
00:45:49,616 --> 00:45:51,417
Perp got away.

696
00:45:51,451 --> 00:45:54,520
What I heard was
you saved someone's life.

697
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:01,293
I let you down.

698
00:46:01,328 --> 00:46:06,365
I should've been there
to back you up.

699
00:46:06,399 --> 00:46:07,499
Yeah, you should've.

700
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:09,401
Yeah.

701
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:15,975
You okay?

702
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:18,744
I guess not, 'cause everybody
keeps asking me that.

703
00:46:23,049 --> 00:46:25,150
I don't want to be alone
tonight.

704
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:31,523
Deb, I'm, uh...

705
00:46:31,558 --> 00:46:33,759
No good for you.

706
00:46:33,793 --> 00:46:37,329
I'm not looking
for good right now.

707
00:46:51,745 --> 00:46:53,312
Is that true...

708
00:46:53,346 --> 00:46:59,551
What you said about your wife?

709
00:46:59,586 --> 00:47:01,787
Yes.

710
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,762
How did it happen?

711
00:47:09,796 --> 00:47:12,965
Knife.

712
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:25,344
Painful and cruel.

713
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,485
I'm sorry...

714
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,988
That I cut you.

715
00:47:38,425 --> 00:47:42,795
I thought you were
a monster, like Boyd.

716
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:48,233
I thought you were
gonna kill me.

717
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:54,073
Or worse.

718
00:47:54,107 --> 00:47:57,943
I was locked up.

719
00:47:57,978 --> 00:48:03,549
I don't know where,
or for how long.

720
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:07,152
All I know is that
it was horrible.

721
00:48:09,823 --> 00:48:13,826
And I thought...
It would never stop.

722
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:24,436
But it has stopped.
He's dead. It's over.

723
00:48:24,471 --> 00:48:27,406
You can go home.

724
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,075
I don't think so.

725
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,277
You can.

726
00:48:35,515 --> 00:48:38,083
I read your letter. I know
you have a family who loves you.

727
00:48:38,118 --> 00:48:41,787
You should go home to them.

728
00:48:41,821 --> 00:48:46,425
It's not that simple.

729
00:48:46,459 --> 00:48:49,194
It is.

730
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:51,196
It really is.

731
00:48:59,072 --> 00:49:01,540
Boyd wasn't the only one
who did this to me.

732
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,011
There were others.

733
00:49:15,155 --> 00:49:18,357
It's not over.

734
00:49:22,328 --> 00:49:32,264
