2
00:01:46,589 --> 00:01:47,856
<i>Previously, on Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,791
- What'd you get?
- Two guys in their 30s.

4
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:50,892
Strong accents.

5
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:53,962
Possibly recent immigrants
from Venezuela.

6
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:55,664
Masuka found a match
on the print

7
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,698
we had from the cigar butt.

8
00:01:56,732 --> 00:01:58,300
Carlos Fuentes.

9
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:01,102
He's got a brother, Marco,
and I got the address.

10
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:03,905
Cut him and I'll blow your
fucking head off.

11
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,106
Ah!

12
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:07,409
Medic!
I need a fucking medic!

13
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:09,344
Don't you dare let him die.

14
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,214
I apologized, he accepted.

15
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:13,582
It's assault and battery.

16
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:15,817
Batista could
not only lose his job,

17
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:17,052
he could serve time.

18
00:02:17,086 --> 00:02:19,621
According to sergeant
Lopez's deposition,

19
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:24,092
you give the best blowjob
in Miami.

20
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:25,660
Do you recognize this man?

21
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:27,128
Jonah, is this Kyle Butler?

22
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:28,597
Back away!
Back away!

23
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:30,765
You're on unpaid suspension
until further notice.

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,334
Suspension?

25
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:35,136
Just tell everyone you're
taking a few vacation days.

26
00:02:35,171 --> 00:02:36,638
I don't want
to be alone tonight.

27
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,673
I'm no good for you.

28
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,675
I'm not looking
for good right now.

29
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,744
I just want to find out
who that girl is

30
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:45,847
before the m99 wears off.

31
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:47,349
Lumen Ann Pierce.

32
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:48,817
Why didn't you take me
to the hospital?

33
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:50,785
Because you saw me.

34
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:53,855
I didn't see anything.

35
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:55,357
We both know that's not true.

36
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:58,827
Every one of these barrels
has a body in it.

37
00:02:58,861 --> 00:02:59,928
Look at this.

38
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,096
No.

39
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,931
This is what happened
to the girls before you.

40
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:04,833
This is what was gonna happen
to you.

41
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:07,869
I saved your life.

42
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:11,172
I was locked up and I thought
it would never stop.

43
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:12,274
But it has stopped.

44
00:03:12,308 --> 00:03:14,276
He's dead.
It's over.

45
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,113
Boyd wasn't the only one who
did this to me.

46
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:21,816
There were others.

47
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,494
We all have something to hide.

48
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:34,195
Some dark place inside us

49
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,900
we don't want the world to see.

50
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:41,903
So we pretend everything's
okay.

51
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:46,007
Wrapping ourselves in rainbows.

52
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:48,877
And maybe that's all
for the best,

53
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:52,314
because some of these places
are darker than others.

54
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:53,415
Carefully.

55
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:55,183
Whoo!

56
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:58,687
I want to believe that smile.

57
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:01,122
That watching your mother die
hasn't changed you

58
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,991
the way watching mine
changed me.

59
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:05,960
Gently falling.

60
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:10,465
Sweetheart!

61
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:12,334
Sweetheart, what is it?

62
00:04:12,368 --> 00:04:15,270
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay.

63
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:16,438
He's got a scratch.

64
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:18,373
Looks like someone was playing
a little rough.

65
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:21,109
That's a little too familiar.

66
00:04:21,143 --> 00:04:22,777
- Let's get a band-aid on him.
- Okay.

67
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:24,479
That's it for today!

68
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:27,048
But I use a scalpel.

69
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,584
All you have are your fingers.

70
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:31,086
Wiped clean.

71
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,188
Not even a year old, you're
already destroying evidence.

72
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:38,593
And having to flee
the scene of the crime.

73
00:04:38,627 --> 00:04:40,595
Aww, it's okay.

74
00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:07,122
Every time you see me,
you look disappointed.

75
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:09,324
Like you were hoping
to find an empty table.

76
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:11,526
Guilty.

77
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,896
Still think you need
to consider my advice.

78
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,832
Leave town?

79
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:21,669
Go home to people
who care about you.

80
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:23,505
I told you why I can't do that.

81
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:28,143
If you stay in Miami,
you'll never get past this.

82
00:05:28,177 --> 00:05:30,912
If you had something
horrible happen to you,

83
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:34,249
could you just forget
about it and move on?

84
00:05:37,353 --> 00:05:39,687
I would want to.

85
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:42,991
What if you couldn't?

86
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:51,299
If you really want to help me
get past this,

87
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:56,604
help me find those guys
and kill them.

88
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,306
I saw you kill Boyd.

89
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,275
You knew what you were doing.

90
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:01,810
Usual?

91
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:05,246
Thanks.

92
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:11,586
Going after those men won't
help you get past this.

93
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,189
It'll only make it worse.

94
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:15,457
How could it get worse?

95
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:17,091
It'll open up something
inside you

96
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,661
you don't want
to know is there.

97
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:20,962
Trust me.

98
00:06:20,996 --> 00:06:23,665
Trust you?

99
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,767
I don't even know
your last name.

100
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:27,769
The less you know about me,
the better.

101
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:28,937
Better for who?

102
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,973
For the both of us.

103
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:33,308
If you're not gonna help me,

104
00:06:33,342 --> 00:06:36,144
why do you keep
coming back here?

105
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:39,781
I'm trying to help you.

106
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:53,795
Minneapolis.

107
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:55,964
Yeah, I used some miles.

108
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:59,701
Wow.

109
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:02,103
You really want to get rid
of me, don't you?

110
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,576
I want you to get on
with your life.

111
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:15,216
Lumen.

112
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:20,455
She took the ticket.

113
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:23,358
Maybe this is one problem
I can check off the list.

114
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:29,464
And maybe it'll snow this week.

115
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:35,470
Whoa.
Where's the fire?

116
00:07:35,504 --> 00:07:36,971
Got to get my ass in gear

117
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:42,143
or I'm gonna be late.

118
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:47,415
I could take that ass
back to bed.

119
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:51,119
What part of "late"
don't you understand?

120
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:54,155
I mean, at least let me make
you breakfast or something.

121
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:55,323
I have no time.

122
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:56,658
I've got to meet Batista
at the hospital.

123
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:58,493
We're interviewing that kid
Fuentes sliced open.

124
00:07:58,527 --> 00:07:59,494
Good luck with that.

125
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:02,163
"Good luck with that"?

126
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:03,565
Fuentes has killed
three people.

127
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,366
I'm running down leads and
you're sitting around

128
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,868
in your boxer shorts
watching TV all day.

129
00:08:06,902 --> 00:08:08,836
Oh, is that why you're,
like, all,

130
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:09,971
"let me get the fuck
out of here,"

131
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:11,072
'cause I'm taking
a few days off?

132
00:08:11,106 --> 00:08:12,140
Just drop it.

133
00:08:12,174 --> 00:08:14,042
This wasn't even my call.

134
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,710
Laguerta said
I had too many days.

135
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:17,211
I had to use 'em or lose 'em.
That's bullshit.

136
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,481
No argument here.

137
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:24,252
I got to go.

138
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:28,790
Quinn's my partner.

139
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:30,291
He should be here.
Not you.

140
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:31,726
No offense.

141
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,727
Look, what do you
want me to do?

142
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:33,995
He put in for his time.

143
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:35,763
No, he told me he was forced
to take his leave.

144
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,632
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Exactly.

145
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,067
So will you talk to Laguerta...
Oh, shit.

146
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,301
What?

147
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:41,336
It's the mother.
What is she doing?

148
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,370
She's coming this way.

149
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:43,571
Oh, fuck me so bad.

150
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,906
What am I supposed to say?
"I'm sorry.

151
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,407
It's my fault your son
got his throat slit"?

152
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,709
No, let me do the talking.

153
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:01,589
<i>De nada, de nada.</i>

154
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,359
Uh, if it's okay with you,

155
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:08,930
we'd like to ask your
son some questions.

156
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,201
<i>Si.</i>

157
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:15,336
Yes.

158
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:16,971
<i>Gracias.</i>

159
00:09:21,176 --> 00:09:22,677
Jandro, how you feeling?

160
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:28,349
<i>- A little better.
- Bueno.</i>

161
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:30,118
We were wondering
if there's anything

162
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:33,187
you can tell us about
the man who injured you.

163
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:39,060
Uh...

164
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:47,902
He's seen him around,
but he didn't know

165
00:09:47,936 --> 00:09:49,370
who he was.

166
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:54,442
<i>No. Nada.</i>

167
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:55,977
I asked if he had
heard anything

168
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,078
about Fuentes around
the neighborhood.

169
00:09:57,112 --> 00:09:58,479
Does he remember
anything about that day?

170
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,882
Anything Fuentes said or did?
Anything at all?

171
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:12,627
He doesn't remember
anything else.

172
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:13,661
He was really scared.

173
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:17,331
Fuentes said he
was going to kill him.

174
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,834
Okay.

175
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:22,737
<i>Gracias.</i>

176
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:23,738
Uh...

177
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,911
He had a mark on his hand.

178
00:10:31,313 --> 00:10:33,347
- A small one.
- Like a tattoo?

179
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:36,918
Can you draw it for us?

180
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:50,732
Lumen needs to stay away
from the darkness.

181
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:54,135
I, on the other hand,
always need names for my table

182
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:56,137
and there are few people
more deserving

183
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:58,005
than Boyd Fowler's accomplices.

184
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,441
Nothing in Boyd's arrest record
even hints he had help.

185
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:01,976
Zero to go on.

186
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,345
I'll have to look elsewhere.

187
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:09,484
Yours.

188
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:11,586
Thanks.
You didn't have to do that.

189
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,887
No, it really is yours.

190
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:15,523
You left it on
the hood of your car.

191
00:11:15,557 --> 00:11:17,091
Oh.

192
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:18,793
My head's in 50 places.

193
00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:21,129
Masuka didn't even begin
to keep up the case load.

194
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:22,997
Well, good luck getting
the midget porn

195
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:24,198
off your hard drive.

196
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:28,136
He might have shown it to me.

197
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,471
How was Mommy and Me?
Harrison break any hearts?

198
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:33,307
No, but he drew
his first blood.

199
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:35,476
I think his little black book
still has a few blank pages.

200
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:37,011
Well, not for long.

201
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:38,246
He missed you this morning.

202
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,514
He's used to having
his aunt Deb

203
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:40,515
feed him his mango oatmeal.

204
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:42,950
Yeah, sorry.

205
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:46,387
You didn't come home
last night.

206
00:11:46,421 --> 00:11:49,257
No, it was late and I didn't
want to wake you,

207
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,958
so I just crashed
at a friend's house.

208
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:52,527
Oh, what friend?

209
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:55,229
What, are you mom now?

210
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:56,531
You want to do lunch?

211
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:58,866
I think I'm gonna
be dining on backlog.

212
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,535
And paying a visit
to Boyd's house.

213
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:02,336
Hmm.

214
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:04,472
All right, well, I'll bring
you something back.

215
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:07,508
Bye.

216
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:15,516
Wait a second.

217
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:19,287
What?

218
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,589
Give me your opinion
as a female.

219
00:12:21,623 --> 00:12:24,692
- As a female?
- As a woman, you know?

220
00:12:24,726 --> 00:12:27,762
McCourt.

221
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:29,230
What about him?

222
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:30,698
Do you find him attractive?

223
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:34,669
Do you?

224
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:35,670
I mean, would you ever?

225
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:38,105
I would rather
put a campfire out

226
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,474
with my face.

227
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,909
Okay?

228
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:43,477
I checked in with Cira.

229
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,613
She's gonna stay on
the ATM video surveillance

230
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:47,215
while I track down the tattoo.

231
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:50,184
Let me see that again.

232
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:51,986
See, it still looks
like a UFO to me.

233
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,788
- Who the fuck knows, right?
- Yeah.

234
00:12:53,822 --> 00:12:54,789
We need to talk to an expert.

235
00:12:54,823 --> 00:12:57,792
- An expert, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

236
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:05,967
The dragon lady represents
the dualities

237
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:09,237
of my inner warrior.

238
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:11,038
Or your inner idiot.

239
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:13,875
Hey, if you can't muster up
the appropriate respect,

240
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:14,942
I'm dropping the curtain.

241
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:17,144
When did you get this?

242
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:20,882
I've been adding
to it over time,

243
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,551
but the main work started
about two years ago.

244
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:25,186
I was having a bit of a crisis

245
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,455
and this was my way
of working through it.

246
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:28,456
Viagra probably
would have been cheaper.

247
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,491
This was a crisis of the soul,
Morgan.

248
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:32,627
Don't you have to have a soul
before it could be in crisis?

249
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:35,062
Point is you know
a little about this world.

250
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:36,063
I know a little.

251
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:37,465
The person you want to talk to

252
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:39,934
is my body artist
Michael Angelo.

253
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:41,469
You're kidding?
Michelangelo?

254
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,004
Two words.
Michael Angelo.

255
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:44,171
And, yes, I'm serious.

256
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:46,674
If your tattoo were done
by anyone local,

257
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,509
Michael Angelo will know.

258
00:13:48,543 --> 00:13:50,444
You can lower the curtain.

259
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:59,253
From the outside, a normal home

260
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:01,155
is indistinguishable
from the home

261
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:04,158
of a monster who puts women
in barrels.

262
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:14,502
But step inside...

263
00:14:14,536 --> 00:14:16,170
There must be something
around here

264
00:14:16,204 --> 00:14:21,142
that will point me
to Boyd's accomplices.

265
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:26,981
Somebody's been here.

266
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:27,982
Oh, great.

267
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:30,685
Blood.

268
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:44,298
They were going through
Boyd's files.

269
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:58,012
Whoever Boyd was working
with must have panicked.

270
00:14:58,046 --> 00:15:02,249
Tried to cover up any trace
of their existence.

271
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:05,252
Amateurs.

272
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:15,229
Here he is, freshly bathed,

273
00:15:15,263 --> 00:15:18,132
clean as a whistle,
and ready for bed.

274
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,368
- Thanks.
- I'm gonna get going.

275
00:15:20,402 --> 00:15:23,704
Check's on the counter.

276
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:25,172
Sonya, can I ask you
a question?

277
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:27,842
Sure.

278
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:31,879
Have you ever noticed
Harrison being...Aggressive?

279
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:33,614
Aggressive?
What do you mean?

280
00:15:33,648 --> 00:15:35,983
Uh, scratching.
Stuff like that.

281
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,252
No.

282
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:39,453
He's a very gentle child,
really.

283
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:41,088
Why?

284
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:42,423
There might have been
an incident

285
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:43,924
at one of the Mommy
and Me classes.

286
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,826
Can't be sure
it was Harrison or not.

287
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,128
He's a little boy.

288
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:48,529
My little brother used
to bite people.

289
00:15:48,563 --> 00:15:50,664
Bloody little cannibal.

290
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,833
Now he's a vegetarian.
Works for Greenpeace.

291
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,035
Well, that's comforting.

292
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:57,238
Not to worry.

293
00:15:57,272 --> 00:15:59,306
You've got a little angel
on your hands.

294
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:00,541
Nothing can change that.

295
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:02,410
See you tomorrow morning.

296
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:06,714
Night.

297
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:13,554
No match for daddy
in the criminal database.

298
00:16:13,588 --> 00:16:16,557
You're absolutely right.
Maybe he drives.

299
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:18,259
Let's check the DMV.

300
00:16:22,664 --> 00:16:26,734
Minnesota.

301
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:30,137
Lumen Ann Pierce.

302
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:34,442
She broke into Boyd's house.

303
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:37,711
She beat me to it.

304
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:25,793
Oh, my God.

305
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:36,170
Dexter.

306
00:17:36,204 --> 00:17:39,173
This seem like the product
of a stable mind?

307
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:47,781
A closet was the only place
she felt safe from them.

308
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,617
She's remade it here.

309
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,019
Dexter, are you listening
to me?

310
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:55,122
Yes, I'm listening.

311
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,590
She's not a killer.
She's not you.

312
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,527
She's coming undone.

313
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:04,565
What's that now?

314
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:08,169
This is the letter she took
from Boyd Fowler's house.

315
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:11,972
From his ex-cellmate
Robert Brunner.

316
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,574
"Getting paroled next week.

317
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:15,276
Need a place to 'sleap'."

318
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,511
S-l-e-a-p.

319
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:20,147
She's found a target.

320
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,216
You don't know
what she's planning.

321
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,919
I know this isn't gonna
end well.

322
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:27,421
She keeps going this way,
she's gonna get herself killed

323
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,257
or thrown in jail and you're
gonna be right there with her.

324
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:33,027
Dex, she's gonna
bring you down.

325
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:53,647
I know what you're doing.

326
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:56,483
Having breakfast?

327
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:58,252
You're looking
for the men who hurt you.

328
00:18:58,286 --> 00:19:02,156
So, what,
you're spying on me now?

329
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,293
What are you gonna do if you
actually find one of these guys?

330
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:07,595
Maybe...

331
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:09,396
What you won't.

332
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:11,065
Are you gonna kill them?
Is that it?

333
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:13,367
I'm sorry.

334
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:17,438
You don't get
to tell me what to do.

335
00:19:17,472 --> 00:19:20,040
I asked for your help.
You turned me down.

336
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:23,043
For your own good.

337
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,880
Look...

338
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,750
You saved my life.
I'm grateful for that.

339
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:32,253
But what I need from you right
now is to leave me alone.

340
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:33,254
Lumen...

341
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:35,923
Don't touch me!

342
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:53,307
These men put five women
in barrels.

343
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:55,075
They're not gonna want
to be found.

344
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,178
Please...

345
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:01,849
Stop this before it's too late.

346
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:17,665
She's not going to stop
until she finds Brunner.

347
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:28,342
My favorite color.

348
00:20:28,376 --> 00:20:30,110
Help you, sergeant?

349
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,478
Morgan has been all over me

350
00:20:31,513 --> 00:20:32,780
the last two days about Quinn.

351
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,014
What about Quinn?

352
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:36,884
The vacation
he's being forced to take.

353
00:20:36,918 --> 00:20:38,919
She's feeling short-handed
without her partner,

354
00:20:38,953 --> 00:20:40,688
and to tell you the truth,
we need him.

355
00:20:40,722 --> 00:20:43,190
Well, it's the union.

356
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:45,292
Not my call.

357
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,796
That all?

358
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,164
Is there anything
I need to know

359
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:51,398
about my case with I.A.?

360
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:54,902
Mm-mm.

361
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:57,638
Is there anything
I need to know

362
00:20:57,672 --> 00:21:03,510
about anything else?

363
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:06,547
I'm sorry, Angel,
but I got to go.

364
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:08,248
Sure.

365
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:09,650
I'll see you tonight?

366
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:11,785
Yeah... Um, I might be late.

367
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,121
Okay, so I'll let you know.

368
00:21:14,155 --> 00:21:16,023
Okay?

369
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,868
Hope you didn't have
to dig too deep.

370
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,203
Only eight boxes,
but I always remember

371
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,738
to lift with my back.

372
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:06,273
Well, here's the guy
you asked for.

373
00:22:06,307 --> 00:22:07,341
Robert Brunner.

374
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,742
Nuh-uh-uh.

375
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:09,843
Like we agreed.
Right.

376
00:22:09,878 --> 00:22:10,978
Hmm.

377
00:22:11,012 --> 00:22:12,379
There you go.

378
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,414
Ahh, aww.

379
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:17,718
That face.

380
00:22:17,752 --> 00:22:20,087
Abduction, torture, rape.

381
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:21,688
Mmm, he's so big.

382
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:22,790
Is he a year yet?

383
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:25,058
- Ten months.
- He's beautiful.

384
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,794
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

385
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:28,395
Seven years for sexual assault.

386
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,830
Out in three for good behavior.

387
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:31,198
Mmm.
Good behavior.

388
00:22:31,232 --> 00:22:32,933
You ever seen scars like that?

389
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:34,701
Yes.
On Lumen.

390
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:36,203
And he's out now.

391
00:22:36,237 --> 00:22:37,971
Thank you, state of Florida.

392
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:40,707
Looks like she stumbled onto
the right guy.

393
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:42,109
Says he's living under
Tuttle Bridge.

394
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:43,110
Is this current?

395
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:44,611
Mm-hmm.

396
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:45,813
Sex offenders can't live
anywhere near kids.

397
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:47,414
Tuttle's the only place
they can go.

398
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,515
Can I keep this?

399
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,783
At depends now.

400
00:22:49,818 --> 00:22:51,885
You gonna bring this little
cutie by to see me?

401
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,922
- Will do.
- Okay.

402
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,490
Tuttle Bridge
is the perfect place

403
00:22:56,524 --> 00:22:59,526
for Brunner to hide
in the dark, but not from me.

404
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:01,795
I've got to get
to him before she does.

405
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:12,606
Tramp stamp.

406
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,007
I think I'm in love.

407
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:15,142
She's into needles.

408
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:18,445
Why don't you
show her your dick?

409
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,280
That's disgusting.

410
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,015
You are so judgmental, Morgan.

411
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,183
I mean, come on.

412
00:23:23,218 --> 00:23:25,185
We all have our own ways
of expressing ourselves.

413
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,022
I have my ink
and you have your...

414
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:30,357
Man-boots.

415
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:32,192
Yeah?

416
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:33,393
Well, expect my man-boots
up your ass

417
00:23:33,428 --> 00:23:35,195
if you're wasting
my time, okay?

418
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,597
Vincent?

419
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:40,634
Now what can I do you for?

420
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:42,035
That's Michael Angelo?

421
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,670
The one and only.

422
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:44,872
M, how are you?

423
00:23:44,906 --> 00:23:46,640
Come here.

424
00:23:46,674 --> 00:23:48,509
- Good to see you.
- Always good to see you.

425
00:23:48,543 --> 00:23:50,277
M, this is the detective
I was telling you about.

426
00:23:50,311 --> 00:23:52,679
Detective Morgan.

427
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:53,747
<i>Enchante.</i>

428
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:56,483
Right.

429
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,918
Mind taking a look
at something for us?

430
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,786
Any friend of sugar's
is a friend of mine.

431
00:23:59,821 --> 00:24:01,555
"Sugar"?

432
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,993
Okay.

433
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,661
We interviewed this kid who saw
this on the hand

434
00:24:07,695 --> 00:24:09,663
of a suspect we're looking for.

435
00:24:09,697 --> 00:24:11,131
Any idea what it means?

436
00:24:11,165 --> 00:24:14,401
Crude, simplistic, but...

437
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:16,003
It's definitely an eye.

438
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:19,072
Look.

439
00:24:19,107 --> 00:24:20,240
The similarity.

440
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:22,342
See?

441
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,578
And that would mean?

442
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:27,180
Eyes symbolize
the third eye in our minds,

443
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,916
like the God horus

444
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,585
and also...

445
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:33,987
Just like...

446
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:37,157
The back of a dollar bill.

447
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,228
Hmm.

448
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:42,896
Have you ever done something
like this?

449
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:44,665
Well, if I had,
I would have remembered it.

450
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:46,767
Anything else you can tell us?

451
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:48,101
We're kind of desperate here.

452
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:49,169
Without it in front of me,

453
00:24:49,203 --> 00:24:51,872
that's the best I can do.

454
00:24:51,906 --> 00:24:54,041
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.

455
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,810
M, thank you so much anyways.

456
00:24:56,844 --> 00:24:58,745
Always for you.

457
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,015
And you...

458
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,451
You come see me anytime, okay?

459
00:25:04,485 --> 00:25:07,354
Okay, thank you.

460
00:25:07,388 --> 00:25:08,689
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

461
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:10,390
Bye.

462
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,458
I'll be in soon.

463
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:13,126
Bye.

464
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:14,461
Hey, I think she likes you.

465
00:25:14,495 --> 00:25:17,864
Don't ever speak about this.

466
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:20,534
Since we're already here,

467
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:21,568
why don't you get Quinn's
name put on your...

468
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,170
Hey, I have a gun.

469
00:25:23,204 --> 00:25:24,171
I'll just wait in the car.

470
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:26,173
Okay.

471
00:25:32,046 --> 00:25:33,246
Hello?

472
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,515
- Cira, it's me.
- Any luck?

473
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,651
Just a steaming pile
of fuck all.

474
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:39,019
Please tell me you have
something.

475
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:41,021
I've gone through most
of the bank's ATM footage.

476
00:25:41,055 --> 00:25:42,422
Eight names and counting.

477
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,657
They're all freaking out
about something

478
00:25:43,691 --> 00:25:45,425
while they're withdrawing
maximum amounts

479
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,560
from their accounts just like
our first

480
00:25:46,594 --> 00:25:47,728
Santa Muerte vics.

481
00:25:47,762 --> 00:25:49,997
I want addresses
for all eight names

482
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:51,565
and any others you can find.

483
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,100
I'll pick you up on my
way to work tomorrow

484
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,702
and we'll check 'em out, okay?

485
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:05,912
Poor Julia Tuttle.

486
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:07,280
The mother of Miami.

487
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:11,051
They named this bridge
after her in her honor.

488
00:26:11,085 --> 00:26:16,056
Now it's crawling with
pedophiles and sex offenders.

489
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,927
So much for honor.

490
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,148
Japan's total area
is slightly smaller

491
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,250
than the U.S. state
of Montana.

492
00:26:43,284 --> 00:26:46,953
You mind if I watch?

493
00:26:46,988 --> 00:26:49,122
The kid fuckers stay over
by the tracks.

494
00:26:49,157 --> 00:26:50,791
That's not why I'm here.

495
00:26:50,825 --> 00:26:52,059
And why is that?

496
00:26:52,093 --> 00:26:54,361
Stuck-up little co-ed and I

497
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:56,096
had a legal disagreement
concerning

498
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:00,767
the meaning
of the word "consent."

499
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:04,705
Take a load off.

500
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:08,075
Appreciate it, brother.

501
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:11,712
Where'd you do your time?

502
00:27:11,746 --> 00:27:14,081
Okeechobee.

503
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,351
My last stretch was
in that shithole.

504
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,087
Rough place.

505
00:27:20,121 --> 00:27:22,589
Yeah.

506
00:27:22,623 --> 00:27:24,825
Told everyone I was in
for armed robbery

507
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:28,628
to keep a target off my back.

508
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:30,230
You from Miami?

509
00:27:30,264 --> 00:27:31,398
Used to be.

510
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:33,667
Guy I bunked with
lives down here now.

511
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:36,103
Thought I'd let him show me
the town and have some fun.

512
00:27:36,137 --> 00:27:37,838
Did that fun include Lumen?

513
00:27:37,872 --> 00:27:40,340
That is until
my parole officer,

514
00:27:40,374 --> 00:27:41,708
the cunt,
started giving me shit

515
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:45,011
about staying with someone
from the joint.

516
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:46,146
Wound up here.

517
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,281
Mmm.
Beats a cell.

518
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:50,083
Barely.

519
00:27:50,118 --> 00:27:54,654
Once my parole is done,
fuck Florida.

520
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:57,023
I'm going north.

521
00:27:57,058 --> 00:28:00,494
Get me some of that
farm-fresh pussy.

522
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:02,629
You ever tap that?

523
00:28:02,663 --> 00:28:05,565
Can't say that I have.

524
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,135
A couple weeks ago...

525
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:12,873
I had this hot little blonde
on all fours.

526
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:14,608
A few of us did.

527
00:28:14,642 --> 00:28:17,043
Believe me, that bitch
got every fucking inch

528
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:20,380
- of my motherfucking...
- That's enough.

529
00:28:24,252 --> 00:28:26,820
This room was meant for Boyd,
not his cellmate.

530
00:28:26,854 --> 00:28:28,889
They were co-workers, partners.

531
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:30,090
Basically the same.

532
00:28:30,124 --> 00:28:31,224
You're sure?

533
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:34,528
I need to kill him

534
00:28:34,562 --> 00:28:35,529
so Lumen doesn't have to.

535
00:28:35,563 --> 00:28:37,164
I don't want her
down that road.

536
00:28:37,198 --> 00:28:38,532
Think about what you're doing.

537
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:40,667
I am.

538
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:42,235
- He's a sex offender.
- I know.

539
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,838
On parole.

540
00:28:44,872 --> 00:28:46,206
What are you saying?

541
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,208
Think!

542
00:28:48,242 --> 00:28:51,211
Are you listening?

543
00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:58,318
Okay.

544
00:28:58,352 --> 00:29:00,153
He's wearing an ankle bracelet.

545
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:01,321
It couldn't have been him.

546
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:06,159
She had the wrong guy.

547
00:29:06,194 --> 00:29:08,228
I was ready to kill him.

548
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:15,769
I was ready to kill him.

549
00:29:15,803 --> 00:29:18,271
I was ready to kill him!

550
00:29:21,742 --> 00:29:24,411
Robert Brunner isn't one
of the men who hurt her.

551
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:30,650
Harry's right.

552
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:34,421
I have to convince Lumen
to do what I never could.

553
00:29:34,455 --> 00:29:38,592
To move on.

554
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:41,094
You're home early.

555
00:29:41,128 --> 00:29:43,163
Where's Sonya?

556
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:44,698
I sent her home.

557
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:46,700
She said you were gonna
be working late.

558
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:48,668
Hope you don't mind,
I grabbed a beer.

559
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,036
What's he doing here?

560
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:54,107
He wanted to...

561
00:29:54,141 --> 00:29:56,710
Borrow...

562
00:29:56,744 --> 00:29:57,744
A book.

563
00:29:57,778 --> 00:30:00,413
He reads?

564
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,414
Yeah, he does.

565
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:03,884
Here.

566
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:05,352
Thanks.

567
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,354
Little vacation reading.

568
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,923
Quinn was just leaving.

569
00:30:09,957 --> 00:30:14,394
What she said.

570
00:30:14,428 --> 00:30:18,131
I will call you
in the morning, Joseph.

571
00:30:18,165 --> 00:30:23,403
Oh, okay, Debra.

572
00:30:23,437 --> 00:30:29,042
Kind of warm for gloves.

573
00:30:29,076 --> 00:30:30,377
Good night.

574
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,078
Thanks for the book.

575
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,721
What was that about?

576
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,890
It's late,
so I'll take the couch.

577
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,627
Are you and Quinn?

578
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:53,733
We're fuck buddies.
That's it.

579
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,602
You need Quinn for that?

580
00:30:55,636 --> 00:30:57,637
I know it's insane.

581
00:30:57,672 --> 00:30:59,739
I... I know it's...

582
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,908
Wrong for a fuck-ton
of reas...

583
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,044
Will you please stop looking
at me like that?

584
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:06,246
It's your life, Deb.

585
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,449
Just don't bring him around
when Harrison's here.

586
00:31:09,483 --> 00:31:10,617
What's that supposed to mean?

587
00:31:10,651 --> 00:31:12,352
Well, he's at
an impressionable age.

588
00:31:12,386 --> 00:31:13,987
We don't know what might
rub off on him.

589
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:17,357
What will rub off on him?

590
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:18,558
Just keep Quinn away
from my son.

591
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:19,659
Fine.

592
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:20,694
You know, you're wrong
about Quinn.

593
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:23,063
He's...

594
00:31:23,097 --> 00:31:24,397
Not that bad.

595
00:31:27,735 --> 00:31:29,469
Hey.

596
00:31:29,503 --> 00:31:32,906
Sorry.
Long day.

597
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,442
Dinner's in the oven.

598
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:39,212
You mind if I hop
in the shower first?

599
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,920
You never called.

600
00:31:46,954 --> 00:31:48,021
Yeah, I know.

601
00:31:48,055 --> 00:31:50,590
I just lost track of time.

602
00:31:50,624 --> 00:31:54,461
Why so late?

603
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:58,898
Budgets are due at
the end of the month, so.

604
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:00,200
I'm gonna...

605
00:32:00,234 --> 00:32:01,468
I'll set the table.

606
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,470
Okay, thanks.

607
00:32:40,674 --> 00:32:41,941
She's not there.

608
00:32:41,976 --> 00:32:44,044
You just missed her.

609
00:32:44,078 --> 00:32:45,645
Did my wife say where
she was going?

610
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,213
You two still not
seeing eye to eye?

611
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:48,915
Look, I really need
to find her.

612
00:32:48,949 --> 00:32:49,916
It's important.

613
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,085
She was asking
about Tuttle Bridge.

614
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:56,456
I told her that is the last
place she wants to be.

615
00:33:16,944 --> 00:33:19,846
What the fuck, asshole?

616
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,014
Nice.

617
00:33:21,048 --> 00:33:22,482
Where you going, baby?

618
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:53,540
What are you doing?

619
00:34:53,574 --> 00:34:56,142
I'm taking you out of here.

620
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,377
- Give me the gun.
- No.

621
00:34:57,411 --> 00:34:59,179
Give it to me!

622
00:34:59,213 --> 00:35:02,048
You have no idea what those
animals did to me.

623
00:35:02,082 --> 00:35:03,483
Passing me around.

624
00:35:03,517 --> 00:35:05,451
I couldn't move.
I couldn't stop them.

625
00:35:05,486 --> 00:35:06,953
- It wasn't Brunner.
- It was.

626
00:35:06,987 --> 00:35:09,222
He was Boyd's cellmate.

627
00:35:09,256 --> 00:35:10,623
He raped three women!

628
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:12,325
He tortured them just
like he did to me.

629
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:13,893
- That's impossible.
- You weren't there!

630
00:35:13,928 --> 00:35:15,361
Just listen to me.

631
00:35:15,396 --> 00:35:17,897
He's wearing an ankle bracelet
as part of his parole.

632
00:35:17,932 --> 00:35:19,566
If he leaves this place,
it gets reported.

633
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,900
I checked.

634
00:35:20,935 --> 00:35:26,539
He was here the whole time
you were taken.

635
00:35:26,574 --> 00:35:28,341
Robert Brunner's
never seen you before.

636
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,443
He's never touched you.

637
00:35:30,477 --> 00:35:32,278
He never hurt you.

638
00:35:32,313 --> 00:35:35,248
You were about to murder
the wrong man.

639
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,755
Oh, fuck.

640
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,758
You see?
This is where it leads.

641
00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:46,926
But it's not too late.

642
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:50,129
There's still no blood
on your hands.

643
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:58,137
I just want to feel better.

644
00:35:58,172 --> 00:36:00,306
I want all this to go away.

645
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:03,543
It will.

646
00:36:03,577 --> 00:36:06,312
I don't see how it can.

647
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:08,314
Go home...

648
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:11,084
Back to your family.

649
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:13,886
If you don't
put this behind you,

650
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:17,957
I swear what you're feeling now
will only get worse.

651
00:36:25,332 --> 00:36:26,799
Okay, okay, okay.

652
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:28,434
I'll go.

653
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:32,872
Okay.

654
00:36:32,906 --> 00:36:35,141
Next one on our ATM list.

655
00:36:35,175 --> 00:36:36,342
Oh-for-fucking-five.

656
00:36:36,377 --> 00:36:41,080
That's how I like
to start my fucking day.

657
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,782
You want to make
a bet why this one

658
00:36:42,816 --> 00:36:45,018
was taking a wad of cash
out of the ATM?

659
00:36:45,052 --> 00:36:47,287
Gambling? Hookers? Drugs?

660
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:48,288
You're very cynical.

661
00:36:48,322 --> 00:36:51,157
It's called being a detective.

662
00:36:51,191 --> 00:36:52,258
And blow me.

663
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,726
You have to put positive energy

664
00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:56,362
out into the universe.

665
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:57,764
Right.

666
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,732
Blow you.

667
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,039
You smell that?

668
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:16,449
Holy shit.

669
00:37:21,088 --> 00:37:22,622
Little help here?

670
00:37:22,656 --> 00:37:23,690
Any time you're ready.

671
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:24,957
Yeah.

672
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,458
This is detective
Morgan requesting CSI

673
00:37:58,492 --> 00:38:01,594
and body transport
at 2075 Ocean Way

674
00:38:01,628 --> 00:38:03,363
for a possible double homicide.

675
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:06,499
And you need to tell
Masuka and Dexter

676
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:09,035
that they need to bring
a bug kit...

677
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:10,636
And some fucking crackers.

678
00:38:13,707 --> 00:38:16,943
You good?

679
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,547
You son of a bitch.

680
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:55,748
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Angel!

681
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:57,417
Hey, sergeant,
you're making a big mistake!

682
00:38:57,451 --> 00:38:58,885
The only mistake I made
was not kicking your ass

683
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,486
when you first laid eyes
on my wife.

684
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:04,157
Angel, let him go!
This is a sting!

685
00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:08,428
Let him go!

686
00:39:08,462 --> 00:39:10,062
You're wearing a wire?

687
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:13,166
No shit, you idiot.

688
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,867
What would have happened if he
barged in here a half hour ago?

689
00:39:14,902 --> 00:39:17,437
I know.

690
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:20,106
Just give us a minute, Jim.

691
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,942
You just don't learn,
do you, Batista?

692
00:39:25,646 --> 00:39:28,848
Have you completely
lost your mind?

693
00:39:28,882 --> 00:39:30,550
- I thought...
- What?

694
00:39:30,584 --> 00:39:31,551
That I was fucking him?

695
00:39:31,585 --> 00:39:33,453
What am I supposed to think?

696
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:35,555
You barely talk to me.

697
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:37,857
The late nights.
The sneaking around.

698
00:39:37,891 --> 00:39:41,294
How'd you find us?

699
00:39:41,328 --> 00:39:43,229
Wait.
You...

700
00:39:43,263 --> 00:39:45,631
I don't even want to know.

701
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:49,302
I.A. needed my help
to bust a narcotics cop

702
00:39:49,336 --> 00:39:51,070
on the take and I said yes.

703
00:39:51,104 --> 00:39:52,138
Why?

704
00:39:52,172 --> 00:39:55,041
To close the books
on your bar fight!

705
00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:57,009
So I don't want to hear
about sneaking around

706
00:39:57,044 --> 00:39:59,111
and late nights!

707
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,646
Why didn't you tell me?

708
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:02,715
Why didn't you trust me?

709
00:40:02,749 --> 00:40:04,317
Maria, I...

710
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:10,723
Morgan needs us on site.
Double homicide.

711
00:40:10,757 --> 00:40:11,724
My car's outside.

712
00:40:11,758 --> 00:40:13,759
I'll ride with patrol.

713
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:25,404
Fuck me.

714
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:27,406
Come on, Liddy.

715
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:37,817
Lieutenant, any comment?

716
00:40:37,851 --> 00:40:39,919
- Not now.
- Lieutenant Laguerta...

717
00:40:39,953 --> 00:40:42,655
It's like the fucking food
chain in action in there.

718
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:44,624
Flies... the blow flies are
attracted by the smell

719
00:40:44,658 --> 00:40:45,925
and they lay eggs
and the beetles,

720
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:46,993
they're drawn by the larvae,

721
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,027
and they burrow
into every orifice...

722
00:40:48,061 --> 00:40:49,996
- I get it.
- What do we know?

723
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,833
The vics' names are Daniel
and Awilda Ortiz.

724
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:55,935
ATM footage showed
Daniel trying

725
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:57,937
to make a maximum withdrawal
about four weeks ago.

726
00:40:57,971 --> 00:41:00,306
Officer Manzon and I show up
to interview him

727
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,707
and we find the bodies.

728
00:41:01,742 --> 00:41:04,210
The remains have already
started to mummify,

729
00:41:04,244 --> 00:41:05,912
but the wounds are consistent
with a machete.

730
00:41:05,946 --> 00:41:07,613
I can make sure when
I get them back to the lab.

731
00:41:07,648 --> 00:41:09,148
We like the Fuentes brothers
for this.

732
00:41:09,182 --> 00:41:11,050
Only weird thing
is we can't find

733
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:13,719
any Santa Claus Muerte
mumbo jumbo bullshit.

734
00:41:13,754 --> 00:41:15,788
We might be looking
at the Fuentes brothers'

735
00:41:15,822 --> 00:41:17,290
first victims.

736
00:41:17,324 --> 00:41:18,991
The defensive wounds
and heavy smearing

737
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:20,893
suggest our killers
were still inexperienced.

738
00:41:20,928 --> 00:41:22,228
Beheading requires skill.

739
00:41:22,262 --> 00:41:24,797
So we got their goddamn
training wheels kill?

740
00:41:24,831 --> 00:41:28,501
Means we're back
to fucking square one.

741
00:41:28,535 --> 00:41:29,802
Little downwind, please.

742
00:41:29,836 --> 00:41:32,104
Oh, yeah.

743
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:34,240
That's never coming out.
I liked this shirt too.

744
00:41:34,274 --> 00:41:36,208
I'll get a jacket out
of my car.

745
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,878
All right.

746
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,698
It was never a tattoo.

747
00:41:58,732 --> 00:42:02,435
It was a stamp
from a nightclub.

748
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:06,272
It was a fucking nightclub!

749
00:42:06,306 --> 00:42:08,441
It's a nightclub!

750
00:42:08,475 --> 00:42:10,176
What's gotten into her?

751
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,345
Find out, sergeant.

752
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:14,347
I'm gonna go deal
with the press.

753
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:15,581
Nice to have you back, Dexter.

754
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:19,885
Good to be back, lieutenant.

755
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,256
Reports on my desk,
first thing.

756
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,760
All together once again.

757
00:42:27,794 --> 00:42:31,631
One big happy family, eh,
Dexerino?

758
00:42:47,814 --> 00:42:49,782
Yeah.

759
00:43:00,093 --> 00:43:01,661
You don't have to wait.

760
00:43:01,695 --> 00:43:05,164
I don't mind.

761
00:43:05,198 --> 00:43:06,565
I can pay you back
for the ticket.

762
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,134
I'll send you some money.

763
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,836
Except...

764
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:15,808
I still don't know who
to send it to.

765
00:43:15,842 --> 00:43:19,545
Dexter Morgan.

766
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:22,348
And it's not necessary.

767
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:24,784
The ticket.

768
00:43:28,655 --> 00:43:31,991
I came to Miami
for a fresh start.

769
00:43:32,025 --> 00:43:33,659
Somewhere warm.

770
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,860
You're doing the right thing.

771
00:43:34,895 --> 00:43:36,862
Your parents will be...

772
00:43:36,897 --> 00:43:39,198
Happy to see you.

773
00:43:39,232 --> 00:43:44,570
I tried to call them,
but I couldn't.

774
00:43:44,604 --> 00:43:48,641
What would I say?

775
00:43:48,675 --> 00:43:53,179
Just give it some time.

776
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:58,050
I can't tell them what
happened to me.

777
00:43:58,085 --> 00:44:01,821
I can't tell anyone.

778
00:44:01,855 --> 00:44:06,025
You're the only one who knows.

779
00:44:09,596 --> 00:44:10,696
You have my number.

780
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,499
Call me if you need
to talk about it.

781
00:44:17,671 --> 00:44:19,171
I should...

782
00:44:19,206 --> 00:44:23,142
Oh, yeah.

783
00:44:23,176 --> 00:44:26,479
Thank you.

784
00:44:35,555 --> 00:44:38,891
You're welcome.

785
00:44:47,667 --> 00:44:49,201
Go ahead.
Put it through.

786
00:44:49,236 --> 00:44:53,939
And your bags.

787
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,076
Make sure everything's
out of your pockets.

788
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,645
Jewelry, belts.

789
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,187
Step to the mat, ma'am.

790
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:09,555
Is there a problem?

791
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:10,689
I can't let you through
to your gate

792
00:45:10,724 --> 00:45:14,193
unless you consent
to a hand search.

793
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,265
Lift your arms.

794
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,367
I need you to stay still.

795
00:45:24,604 --> 00:45:27,206
Spread your legs.

796
00:46:24,931 --> 00:46:25,965
Are you home?

797
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:27,766
Not quite.

798
00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:29,201
Are you at a bar?

799
00:46:29,236 --> 00:46:30,803
I had to gas up the car.

800
00:46:30,837 --> 00:46:32,404
My fault O'Malley's
is on the way?

801
00:46:32,439 --> 00:46:34,306
So ask me how my day was.

802
00:46:34,341 --> 00:46:35,441
How was your day?

803
00:46:35,475 --> 00:46:37,576
It was better than yours,
slacker,

804
00:46:37,611 --> 00:46:38,911
'cause I know where Carlos
and his brother

805
00:46:38,945 --> 00:46:39,945
have been hanging out.

806
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,614
At a local club called
the Mayan.

807
00:46:41,648 --> 00:46:43,449
You got your lead.
Congrats.

808
00:46:43,483 --> 00:46:44,583
Yeah, we stake this place out,

809
00:46:44,618 --> 00:46:45,951
they show up, and then we take

810
00:46:45,986 --> 00:46:47,553
these Santa Muerte
no-dicks down for good.

811
00:46:47,587 --> 00:46:49,889
How about I get some steaks
and beer and we celebrate?

812
00:46:49,923 --> 00:46:52,057
Well, there's nothing
to celebrate just yet,

813
00:46:52,092 --> 00:46:54,460
but I have a good feeling
about this one.

814
00:46:54,494 --> 00:46:56,428
Now get your ass moving.
I'm starving.

815
00:46:56,463 --> 00:46:58,230
On my way.

816
00:46:59,866 --> 00:47:02,167
Thanks for the cuervo, stud.

817
00:47:02,202 --> 00:47:04,370
No problem.

818
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,739
I heard what happened.

819
00:47:06,773 --> 00:47:09,742
Fuck those I.A. rats.

820
00:47:09,776 --> 00:47:12,177
And your boss.

821
00:47:12,212 --> 00:47:14,580
She's the reason I'm here.

822
00:47:14,614 --> 00:47:17,082
Unpaid leave.
Why?

823
00:47:17,117 --> 00:47:18,584
For doing my fucking job.

824
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:21,854
That bitch put handcuffs on me

825
00:47:21,888 --> 00:47:24,256
and then that no-nuts
McCourt parades me

826
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:27,293
around that station like I'm
a goddamn carnival prize.

827
00:47:27,327 --> 00:47:29,428
Well, they can both go
fuck the dog.

828
00:47:29,462 --> 00:47:31,063
They think I'm gonna cop a plea,
they're both

829
00:47:31,097 --> 00:47:32,531
cracking walnuts up their ass.

830
00:47:32,565 --> 00:47:34,967
I'm gonna fight this thing
to my last damn dime.

831
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:39,939
You need some extra cash
for those lawyers,

832
00:47:39,973 --> 00:47:41,807
I might have a job for you.

833
00:47:41,841 --> 00:47:43,642
Really?

834
00:47:43,677 --> 00:47:45,177
And what would that be?

835
00:47:45,211 --> 00:47:46,946
- Looking into someone.
- Who?

836
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,815
Guy I work with.
Interested?

837
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:51,450
I don't know if I should be

838
00:47:51,484 --> 00:47:53,852
considering who's sitting
in front of me making the offer.

839
00:47:53,887 --> 00:47:55,154
What are you talking about?

840
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:56,555
Have I ever fucked you over?

841
00:47:56,589 --> 00:47:59,657
No, but Laguerta just taught me
there's always a first time.

842
00:48:00,293 --> 00:48:01,493
Look, Quinn,

843
00:48:01,528 --> 00:48:03,929
you fuck with the bull,

844
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,065
you get the horn.

845
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:07,166
You understand?

846
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,335
Yeah.
Do you?

847
00:48:18,044 --> 00:48:19,111
You got a name?

848
00:48:19,145 --> 00:48:21,113
Dexter Morgan.

849
00:48:21,147 --> 00:48:24,116
Dexter.

850
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,185
What the fuck kind of name
is "Dexter"?

851
00:48:32,525 --> 00:48:35,027
Rainbows are an illusion.

852
00:48:35,061 --> 00:48:37,229
Refracted light to make us think
something's there

853
00:48:37,263 --> 00:48:39,999
when it's really not.

854
00:48:40,033 --> 00:48:41,800
Is there darkness in Harrison

855
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:47,339
or is it just my own fear
being reflected back?

856
00:48:47,374 --> 00:48:51,243
I just know he's the one
who scratched Teddy.

857
00:48:51,277 --> 00:48:52,544
He was right next to him.

858
00:48:52,579 --> 00:48:54,646
Did you read about
what happened to his mother?

859
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,548
That boy will never
be the same.

860
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:59,618
There's nothing wrong
with my son.

861
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,995
I'm sorry for ever thinking
the worst, Harrison.

862
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,298
You'll always be my son.

863
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:18,570
Whatever we have to face,
we'll face together, okay?

864
00:49:18,605 --> 00:49:20,973
Ow!

865
00:49:21,007 --> 00:49:22,441
Hello, ma'am.

866
00:49:22,475 --> 00:49:23,575
Where you headed
this afternoon?

867
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:26,578
You need a cab?

868
00:49:34,587 --> 00:49:36,522
Welcome to Miami.
