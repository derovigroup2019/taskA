2
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,906
<i>Previously, on Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:51,976
Rita's inside.

4
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,511
It was me.

5
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:55,013
FBI?

6
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:56,481
Fucking bunch of idiots.

7
00:01:56,515 --> 00:02:00,118
You want to talk to Dexter,
schedule an appointment.

8
00:02:00,152 --> 00:02:02,020
I'll do that.

9
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:04,389
If this were anyone but Dexter,

10
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:06,824
we'd at least be thinking
like detectives.

11
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,927
When the wife is dead,
90% of the time,

12
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,461
the husband did it.

13
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:14,532
What are you doing?

14
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:19,304
You wanna talk about it,
or you just gonna act weird?

15
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:20,338
There's nothing to talk about.

16
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:22,106
All Rita and I
ever did was kiss.

17
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,008
Dexter found out
about the indiscretion,

18
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,679
and, uh, came over
and punched me out.

19
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:29,213
Arthur Mitchell.

20
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,214
Kyle Butler.

21
00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:32,016
And what's his name?

22
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,217
Uh, Kyle Butler.

23
00:02:35,387 --> 00:02:36,721
Something happened...

24
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:38,423
To your mom.

25
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:40,258
She's dead!

26
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:41,559
And it doesn't even matter
to you!

27
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:43,061
<i>I wish you were dead!</i>

28
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:44,362
I just got a call from the FBI.

29
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:45,997
About your brother's interview.

30
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:47,031
Don't tell me.
What'd he say?

31
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,099
He didn't show.

32
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:49,667
I don't know where
the fuck you are

33
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,903
or why you think you can fucking
run away from the FBI,

34
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:53,004
but you better
get back here bef...

35
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:58,676
My wife died,
and it was my fault.

36
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,846
Your dead wife
can suck my dick.

37
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:08,019
That's the first human thing
I've seen you do

38
00:03:08,053 --> 00:03:09,554
since she died, Dexter.

39
00:03:09,588 --> 00:03:12,623
They're not better off
without you.

40
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:16,027
You're not better off
without them.

41
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:18,029
You need to go back.

42
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:33,544
It's said there are
seven stages of grief.

43
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:37,982
I suppose killing someone

44
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,751
with my bare hands
in a men's room

45
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:42,453
was my way of working
through the anger stage.

46
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:50,628
Whatever the other
six stages are...

47
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:52,897
I don't have time for them.

48
00:03:57,603 --> 00:04:01,806
'Cause now
I'm a full-time dad.

49
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,243
Once the kids and I
are back together,

50
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:07,645
it'll all be fine.

51
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:20,658
I can't believe we're
all gonna squish in here.

52
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:23,661
It's just temporary,
till we can get a new place.

53
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:24,996
Here...

54
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,599
He needs to be
hosed off or something.

55
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:30,501
Hey.

56
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:31,502
Welcome home.

57
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,371
This isn't our home.

58
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:35,907
And why do we need
a new place, anyway?

59
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:37,141
I think starting
in a new apartment

60
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,176
will be good for us.

61
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,510
Look, I found a place

62
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:40,745
practically on the beach.

63
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:43,414
Or another one
right next to a park.

64
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,149
But, until then, Astor,

65
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,185
you get to share
the bed with me.

66
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:49,087
And, Dexter,
you're on the couch.

67
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:51,522
Cody, you're on the cot.

68
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:54,992
Time for you both
to get to bed... school tomorrow.

69
00:04:55,027 --> 00:04:56,861
How can I go to school?

70
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:59,497
I don't even have
any of my things.

71
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,266
Make a list.
I'll go by the house tomorrow.

72
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:03,768
I want to go with you.

73
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:05,336
I don't think
that's a good idea.

74
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,105
Why?

75
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,973
Well...

76
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,842
Because of what happened
to your mother there.

77
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:12,944
I know what happened to my mom.

78
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,178
She was murdered.

79
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:23,688
Don't forget,
9 A.M. tomorrow.

80
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:25,957
FBI interview.

81
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,128
One final loose end to tie up

82
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:32,797
before putting
all this behind me.

83
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:38,970
At the time
of your wife's death,

84
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:40,571
you were...

85
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,206
I already told you.
I was on my boat.

86
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,875
Right.

87
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:46,144
Just seemed odd.

88
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:48,446
You do a lot of night boating,
Mr. Morgan?

89
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,914
Sometimes.
It's more peaceful.

90
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:51,182
And you were by yourself?

91
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,483
Yes, I was alone.

92
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,684
There's security cameras
at the marina.

93
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:55,353
You can see me leaving
and returning.

94
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:56,854
We've seen the footage,
Mr. Morgan.

95
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,090
Problem is, according
to the coroner's report,

96
00:05:59,124 --> 00:06:00,424
your wife
was killed several hours

97
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:01,726
before you got on the boat.

98
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,027
Is that what this is about?

99
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:05,163
You fucking serious?

100
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:09,934
Suggesting I have anything to do
with my wife's death...

101
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:11,002
That I'd slice her artery,

102
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,103
let her bleed out
in the bathroom...

103
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:13,804
Mr. Morgan,

104
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,274
we know that you were
at Arthur Mitchell's house.

105
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,879
At the time
of your wife's death,

106
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,114
you were part of the team

107
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:25,049
that raided
Arthur Mitchell's house.

108
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,954
Right, of course.

109
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:32,156
We know you didn't
kill your wife.

110
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,558
We're just looking for a reason

111
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:35,126
why Arthur Mitchell
might have targeted her.

112
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:44,702
Because he's a serial killer?

113
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:52,877
How'd it go?

114
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:55,279
It's...fine.

115
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:58,683
I'm just glad it's over,
and I can move on.

116
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:00,284
We miss you, brother.

117
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,552
Yeah?

118
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,955
How's handling the department
all by yourself?

119
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:05,623
Ah, it's a breeze.

120
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:06,958
I'll be back in a few days.

121
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:08,459
Oh, no you won't.

122
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:09,894
You're taking
at least another week.

123
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:12,296
You need to spend time
with your family.

124
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,798
Thanks.

125
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:14,899
Excuse me.

126
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,867
Anything you need, Dexter,
just ask.

127
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:19,337
I will.

128
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:21,305
See you tonight.

129
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,674
Oh, grandparents
stopping by too.

130
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:28,312
They're all staying
at your place?

131
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,547
Yeah.

132
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:31,749
It's crowded.

133
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,150
But it's temporary.

134
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:34,318
He just doesn't want
the kids staying at the house

135
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,821
where their mom...
Right.

136
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:38,656
So...We all good here?

137
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,991
Yeah, he's airtight.

138
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:41,659
But otherwise,
we got Jack shit.

139
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:43,160
Arthur Mitchell disappeared.

140
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:47,064
The only lead we have now
is this Kyle Butler.

141
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,933
We had a murder victim
by that name

142
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:50,134
a few weeks back.

143
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:52,336
Well, our guy's alive,
as far as we know.

144
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,305
Unfortunately,
he's disappeared as well.

145
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:55,606
We're gonna
have a sketch artist

146
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,275
meet with the family,
and get a composite of him.

147
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,609
Okay.

148
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,678
Well, I'd appreciate it
if you'd keep me posted.

149
00:08:00,712 --> 00:08:01,779
Will do.

150
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,450
Oh, hey.

151
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:12,623
Maria, your mail.

152
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,608
<i>?Pero que cono?</i>

153
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,314
So, Dexter Morgan,

154
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:38,049
let's get you a moving van.

155
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,318
Aren't you a cute kid, huh?

156
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:41,652
Huh?

157
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,988
He's not actually talking yet.

158
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:45,523
Here's your 18-footer.

159
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:47,291
What's his name?

160
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,659
Harrison.

161
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,860
14-footer.

162
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:51,529
It's a family name?

163
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:59,136
Blood.

164
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,905
Uh, sort of.

165
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:03,407
So what kind of stuff
you moving?

166
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,076
Just, uh, furniture, clothes.

167
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,877
Uh, dresser, maybe.

168
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:08,713
Plenty of reasons
for blood to be there.

169
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:10,348
Someone cut himself moving...

170
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:11,682
Well, that's all
we're talking about.

171
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,318
Save yourself some money.
Go with the 10-footer.

172
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,156
I can't
let myself think about this.

173
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,325
I've just got to move the kids.

174
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,697
Actually, I think I'll go
with the 14-footer.

175
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,267
Okay, let's, uh, write you up.

176
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:53,124
We're gonna get
a much better place.

177
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:54,625
What do you think,
closer to the park

178
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:56,360
or the beach?

179
00:09:57,562 --> 00:09:58,963
Hello?

180
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:00,398
Dexter?

181
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:03,567
No annoying neighbors.

182
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:06,070
Hey, Dex.

183
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:07,705
- Brought your mail.
- Thanks.

184
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,783
Wow, look at Harrison.

185
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:22,319
Boy, he's just getting bigger
every day.

186
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:24,155
Hey, look, Dex, um...

187
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:26,257
You know, we haven't
had a chance to talk.

188
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,792
But I just...
I wanted to let you know

189
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:30,594
how sorry I am
about everything.

190
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,829
Thanks.

191
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:35,032
Have they caught
the trinity killer yet or...

192
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:36,534
No.

193
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:38,335
Man, if I could just
get my hands on him.

194
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,904
I can only imagine.

195
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:41,172
Hey, listen, you know,

196
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:42,239
I know we've
had our differences,

197
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,508
but, you know,
I'm a single dad.

198
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,810
I mean, I know the ropes, so...

199
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,845
- If you need any help...
- No, I'm good.

200
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,313
'Cause, you know,
you gotta give up a lot.

201
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:52,149
I mean, I actually have a pretty
decent career going, you know.

202
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,851
But I had to turn down
some major job offers

203
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:55,319
so I could just work at home

204
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:56,854
and just, you know,
be there for those kids.

205
00:10:56,888 --> 00:10:58,722
Good for you.

206
00:10:58,757 --> 00:11:01,592
I mean, forget
about any free time.

207
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:03,494
Or any life of your own,
really.

208
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:05,162
I mean, you just, you know,
you have to be there.

209
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,697
Right? Every morning.
Every evening.

210
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:07,998
Every weekend.

211
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:10,000
You ready to do that, Dex,

212
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:13,370
for the kids?

213
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:15,339
Yes, Elliot,
I'm ready to do that.

214
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:17,107
For the kids.

215
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:20,044
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Here, let me...

216
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:21,045
No! I got it.

217
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:22,480
Okay, well...

218
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:24,415
But you know what?
It works out.

219
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:25,783
It really does, you know.

220
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:27,518
I mean, yeah, you have
to give up your life and all,

221
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:29,320
but, uh...You know what?

222
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:30,588
You just... you live
for those kids,

223
00:11:30,622 --> 00:11:35,292
and...It's satisfying.

224
00:11:37,062 --> 00:11:38,195
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

225
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:47,738
I'll be a good father.
Everyone makes sacrifices.

226
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:48,806
I can too.

227
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:09,026
Focus on the kids.

228
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,296
Wow, I didn't know you
were gonna bring so much.

229
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,464
You can just put that...

230
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:15,466
Right there is great.

231
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,901
I emptied the refrigerator.

232
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:19,036
Someone left
another cake at the door.

233
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,671
I just ate
a whole tuna casserole

234
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:22,473
to make room in the apartment.

235
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:24,275
Cody, is is a good job for you.

236
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:25,476
Wanna help me unload the food?

237
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,444
Okay.

238
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,883
Wow. You sure do have
a lot of beer, aunt Deb.

239
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:35,619
Uh...

240
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,222
People just keep bringing it.

241
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:39,490
Heh.

242
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:42,159
This is all you brought?

243
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:44,895
Uh, well, we're a little
short on space.

244
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,864
You didn't even
bring the right clothes.

245
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:48,465
This was my reject stuff.

246
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,833
I can't wear
any of this to school.

247
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:52,836
Astor, come on.
No one's gonna notice you.

248
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:57,775
Uhh, okay.

249
00:12:57,809 --> 00:12:59,076
Honey, would you hold the baby?

250
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,378
- Come here.
- Cody.

251
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:06,417
Why don't you help us
carry the last load in, hmm?

252
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:08,986
I like it here.
It's like camping.

253
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,523
Exactly.

254
00:13:12,557 --> 00:13:14,491
Boys are easier.

255
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:26,337
It doesn't matter how much
I love my children,

256
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:28,372
I'm still a creature
of the night.

257
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:38,349
Can't sleep either?

258
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:45,990
The blood
probably means nothing.

259
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:50,160
Someone cut their finger
while moving.

260
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:52,129
But I won't be able
to put it out of my mind

261
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:55,432
until I know for sure.

262
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,775
Someone did
a quick cleanup job,

263
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:06,744
but forgot to wash the door.

264
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,446
Yeah, it's pretty.

265
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,681
I know.

266
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,119
But not the story it tells.

267
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:19,456
Once upon a time,

268
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,758
an evil green ogre

269
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:24,194
left a circular spatter
at three feet high,

270
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:27,464
consistent with
blunt force trauma...

271
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,801
Which seems to indicate
the handsome young prince

272
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:33,037
was hit while on his knees,

273
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:34,772
at least two or three times.

274
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:41,545
Or the princess
was on her knees.

275
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,380
Small hands.

276
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,215
Female.

277
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,766
I thought the kids were
your number one responsibility.

278
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,868
- They are.
- But here you are...

279
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,003
In the middle of the night.

280
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:08,372
It's not that simple.

281
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:09,473
It never is.

282
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:13,010
It's like when
you get on a plane.

283
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:15,546
They tell you
if the oxygen masks come down

284
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,181
to put yours on first

285
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:18,348
before helping the kids.

286
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:20,884
I have to take care
of my own needs too.

287
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:24,722
Otherwise, I risk
spinning out of control.

288
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:26,356
That's not good for anyone.

289
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:28,792
I'm not just saying this
for the sake of the kids, Dex,

290
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,360
but for you.

291
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:33,564
They're not only
your responsibility.

292
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:35,232
They're your salvation.

293
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:44,408
I have to give him a bottle.

294
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,262
No reason a truck rental agency

295
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:07,798
would put any serious
safeguards on their records.

296
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:14,671
The truck was most recently
rented to Boyd Fowler.

297
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:17,007
Boyd seems to have
listed his address

298
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,476
as the department
of sanitation.

299
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,646
No home address.

300
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,282
Miami-Dade County Department
of Sanitation,

301
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:27,785
division of dead animal pickup,

302
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,987
meaning the blood belongs
to an animal.

303
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,628
But what about those
little hand prints?

304
00:16:52,977 --> 00:16:55,045
Two lines.

305
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,079
Human.

306
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:17,467
Well, well, well.
What do we got here?

307
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:20,671
Raccoon.

308
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:22,439
- You call this in?
- Yeah, I did.

309
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:23,740
I was driving down the road,

310
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:25,742
and...I saw it.

311
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:27,277
Kind of creeps me out.

312
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,913
You're probably used to
seeing dead things, though, huh?

313
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,882
Can't say I ever
get used to it.

314
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,250
I don't usually come this way,

315
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:35,018
but I'm in the middle
of moving to a new place.

316
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,254
It's a hassle, huh?
Moving?

317
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:38,622
- I wouldn't know.
- No?

318
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:41,658
Lived in the same house
for over 20 years.

319
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,126
So why did you
rent a moving van?

320
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:45,028
Hello there, bandit.

321
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:50,067
This don't look right.

322
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:51,335
What do you mean?

323
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:53,237
Well, usually, you find a dead
animal in the road,

324
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:54,872
it means he was hit by a car.

325
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:56,907
But there's no tire marks
or blood on the asphalt.

326
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:59,710
This raccoon was killed
someplace else and dropped here.

327
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:01,578
He's C.S.I.-ing me.

328
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:09,820
He's got
defensive wounds on his paws.

329
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:11,488
Little guy put up
quite a struggle.

330
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:25,269
Alrighty then.

331
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:33,176
He's definitely peculiar.

332
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:34,811
But I guess
the best and brightest

333
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:37,514
don't typically get into
dead animal pickup.

334
00:18:46,524 --> 00:18:48,091
Just so you know, okay?

335
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:50,560
What do we got?

336
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:52,162
We got a female victim.

337
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:53,630
Part of a female victim.

338
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,165
- Part?
- We got a head.

339
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:56,934
Just a head?

340
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:58,068
Yeah.

341
00:18:58,102 --> 00:18:59,303
Decapitation.

342
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:00,837
Probably some kind
of drug killing.

343
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:01,872
Nice.

344
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:09,846
Let me ask you a question,
hypothetical.

345
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:12,482
- Say a newly-married person...
- Mm-hmm.

346
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:15,252
Accidentally discovers
that his or her new spouse

347
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:17,454
has a savings account
with a lot of money.

348
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:21,091
Is that something that one
should expect to share?

349
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,327
Fuck, no.
That's your money.

350
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:25,662
You tell the lieutenant to keep
her fuckin' hands off it.

351
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,833
Take me to the head.

352
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:31,134
All right.

353
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:40,877
She was still alive
when they cut her head off.

354
00:19:40,912 --> 00:19:43,180
Excision of eyes and tongue
was done post-mortem.

355
00:19:43,214 --> 00:19:44,715
That's considerate of them.

356
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:46,550
You were right.

357
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:47,985
It's just a head.

358
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:50,520
Unless they buried her
standing up.

359
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:56,093
What are you doing?

360
00:19:56,127 --> 00:19:58,362
Just trying to help you.
Looking a little ragged.

361
00:19:58,396 --> 00:19:59,563
I'm exhausted.

362
00:19:59,597 --> 00:20:01,198
There are five people
in my tiny apartment.

363
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:02,532
I shared a bed
with Astor last night,

364
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:04,101
and she kicked me
all night long.

365
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:06,036
You know, you're welcome
to crash at my place,

366
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,137
if you want.

367
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:09,539
Uh, no thanks, detective.

368
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:10,807
Okay.

369
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,946
It looks like Santa Muerte.

370
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,547
What?

371
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:20,617
Santa Muerte, the cult.
"Saint death."

372
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:22,686
Yeah, I know what it is,
but why do you say that?

373
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,788
Well, the missing eyes
and tongue

374
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:26,323
were meant to send a message.

375
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:29,059
You didn't see anything,
you're not gonna say anything.

376
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:30,394
Who are you?

377
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:32,829
Officer Manzon.
Cira.

378
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,498
The golden candles mean money.

379
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:35,999
The icons, I don't know.

380
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,768
There's so many now.

381
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:38,935
Might need an expert on it.

382
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,470
And you know
all of this because...

383
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,471
It's my neighborhood.

384
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:44,474
And if it is Santa Muerte...

385
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,109
They used a machete on her.

386
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,677
Okay, well,
we'll keep that in mind.

387
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:49,913
But this park is
a local drug hangout,

388
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:51,415
and drug cartels like
to cut heads off.

389
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:52,649
So we might follow that lead.

390
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:54,518
Of course.

391
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:56,453
Hey...We found the body

392
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:59,990
on the other end of the park,
under the bushes, no I.D.

393
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:03,527
Gotta canvass the neighborhood,
start asking questions.

394
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:05,595
No one will talk.
They're too afraid.

395
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,664
Well, we still ask, officer.

396
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,405
"Helping your children
cope with grief."

397
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,676
"Grandpa's gone to heaven."

398
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:23,647
"Saying good-bye to Fluffy."

399
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:27,184
But nothing on
"mommy bled out in a bathtub."

400
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:43,066
Boyd Fowler,
you have a prison record.

401
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,001
Assault with a deadly weapon.

402
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:47,137
18 months at Okeechobee.

403
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,842
You said you lived in a house,

404
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:55,879
but there are no mortgage
records in your name.

405
00:21:55,913 --> 00:22:00,350
In the same house
for over 20 years.

406
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:03,587
You inherited it
from your parents,

407
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:06,590
rich and Elsie Fowler
in Opa-Locka.

408
00:22:11,462 --> 00:22:13,063
Hey.

409
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:14,698
How was your day?

410
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:17,601
A whole afternoon getting
doors shut in my face.

411
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:19,769
Sorry.

412
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:22,839
You?

413
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,141
Okay.

414
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:26,977
We finished Laguerta's
caserola de camarones

415
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:28,545
and Masuka's
chocolate lava cake,

416
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:30,947
and Astor told me
she hated living here.

417
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:34,718
They're both asleep in the bed.

418
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,087
Looking at apartments.

419
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:41,091
So it's everything as usual.

420
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:44,728
They're seeing
a grief counselor tomorrow.

421
00:22:44,762 --> 00:22:47,831
Maybe that'll help.

422
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:49,666
Still, even after...

423
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,935
What?

424
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:53,904
You're gonna be a single dad

425
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:55,872
raising three kids.

426
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,241
Gonna be hard.

427
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,310
Rita was a great mom.

428
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:02,112
There's nothing I can do
to make up for that.

429
00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:04,347
But I'm gonna have to try.

430
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:10,654
Well, I'll be here.

431
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:11,721
You can count on me.

432
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,792
The kids'll be okay.

433
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,833
Know that place.

434
00:23:23,868 --> 00:23:26,670
It's near the station.

435
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:27,871
They have an open house
tomorrow.

436
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:28,939
Maybe I'll check it out
for you.

437
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:31,875
Great.

438
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:33,443
You want the couch tonight?

439
00:23:33,477 --> 00:23:35,212
No, you take it.

440
00:24:05,676 --> 00:24:06,776
- Hey.
- Hi.

441
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:08,078
Glad you called.

442
00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:09,779
Hey, fuck puddle.
What are you doing?

443
00:24:09,814 --> 00:24:10,847
Just giving you a kiss hello.

444
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:12,616
I-I came over here
to sleep,

445
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,252
not to have your fat little
sausage fingers all over me.

446
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,992
There's no room for me
at my own place.

447
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:26,730
Unless I want to curl up inside
a fuckin' toaster oven.

448
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:30,100
I'm trying so hard
to be a good sister,

449
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:32,335
'cause fuck knows, Dexter's
always been the best brother.

450
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,072
But...It is
fucking exhausting.

451
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,173
I'm sure.

452
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,441
Well, look,

453
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:41,311
you're, uh,
welcome to stay here

454
00:24:41,345 --> 00:24:42,779
for as long as you want,

455
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:44,247
whenever you want.

456
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:47,717
And I promise to keep my fat
little sausage fingers off you.

457
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,185
You better.

458
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,054
- How's your brother?
- You know.

459
00:24:51,088 --> 00:24:52,722
I heard the FBI interview
went well.

460
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:53,823
I mean, that must
be a load off.

461
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:55,158
Why would that be a load off?

462
00:24:55,192 --> 00:24:57,060
Nothin'.
Never mind.

463
00:24:57,094 --> 00:24:59,629
They're looking for someone
named Kyle Butler

464
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,231
who's a friend
of Arthur Mitchell's.

465
00:25:01,265 --> 00:25:02,432
They think
if they can find him,

466
00:25:02,466 --> 00:25:03,633
then he can lead them
to Mitchell.

467
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,701
But they can't find him?

468
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:06,036
Well, not yet.

469
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,203
They're having sketches done.

470
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:08,738
They're trying to get
a positive I.D.

471
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:09,973
Kyle Butler.

472
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:11,508
Why does that name
sound so familiar?

473
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:12,609
Well, that's the weird thing.

474
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:14,177
We worked that case, remember?

475
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:15,612
A dead Kyle Butler.

476
00:25:15,646 --> 00:25:17,414
Right, he got his head
smashed in.

477
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:20,183
Went unsolved.

478
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:22,419
Any connection?
I don't know.

479
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:25,722
I'm sure the FBI will
find a way to fuck it up.

480
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:28,158
Will you get the lights?

481
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:29,459
Yes, ma'am.

482
00:25:34,932 --> 00:25:36,599
What do you want to do
for the next batch?

483
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:38,468
Mickey mouse, silver dollar?

484
00:25:38,502 --> 00:25:40,637
Great big ones?
Triangles.

485
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:42,305
A challenge.

486
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,676
Dexter's making
triangle pancakes.

487
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,312
Actually, they're more freeform.

488
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,381
Wanna set the table for us?

489
00:25:51,415 --> 00:25:52,816
Uh, sure.

490
00:25:55,786 --> 00:25:57,721
They're just blobs.

491
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:59,089
How dare you?

492
00:26:05,229 --> 00:26:06,529
Triangles.

493
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:15,605
I counted too many plates.

494
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:19,142
Mom's not here.

495
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:20,810
- That's okay.
- No, it's not.

496
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,546
She should be here.
I'm sorry.

497
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,248
That doesn't make a difference.

498
00:26:25,282 --> 00:26:26,716
Astor, I'm doing
the best I can here.

499
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,119
Let's just...Sit down
and have some breakfast.

500
00:26:29,153 --> 00:26:30,653
I don't want to!

501
00:26:30,688 --> 00:26:32,722
I wanna go back home!
Astor...

502
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,524
- Stop it!
- Yeah, just stop it!

503
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:36,793
Both of you just stop
fighting all the time!

504
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:38,261
I hate it!

505
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:51,374
While they're seeing
the grief counselor,

506
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,110
I'll be getting
my own kind of therapy.

507
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:01,418
So is this, uh...

508
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:03,119
Something we should talk about?

509
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,522
Whatever's going on between us?

510
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:06,556
- No.
- I mean...

511
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,458
We have sex one day,
and then...

512
00:27:08,492 --> 00:27:09,626
I'm sorry,
I'm not the kind of person

513
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,060
who would ever
have sex with you.

514
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:12,095
I don't know what we're doing.

515
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:13,263
We're not doing anything.

516
00:27:13,297 --> 00:27:14,597
We never did do anything.

517
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,899
We never will do anything.

518
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,434
- So we never had sex?
- Exactly.

519
00:27:17,468 --> 00:27:18,435
That's really weird.

520
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:19,502
'Cause I remember...

521
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,704
I gotta go now.
I'm gonna go.

522
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:32,615
How's it going?

523
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,784
I hate this shit.

524
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:41,858
This is Dexter's job.

525
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:43,526
Blood. It's gross.

526
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:46,763
Well, whoever cut the head off

527
00:27:46,797 --> 00:27:48,932
used the same weapon to cut
the eyes and the tongue out.

528
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:51,067
But I can't find
anything that fits.

529
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:53,269
I mean, I've tried two swords,
three knives.

530
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:54,971
Hey...Try the machete.

531
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:00,877
Yeah.

532
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:16,059
Huh.

533
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:17,794
I think we have a match.

534
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,165
I'll send somebody
over there right away.

535
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,266
Okay, yeah.

536
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,575
How's it going in there?

537
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,678
Masuka said he really
likes working with the blood.

538
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,680
He hopes he can get
more assignments like this.

539
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:38,681
I'll keep that in mind.

540
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,583
Let me ask you a question.

541
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:41,684
If you were married...

542
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,952
And you found out

543
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,354
that the person
you were married to

544
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:45,655
had a secret bank account

545
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:47,290
with a lot of money,

546
00:28:47,324 --> 00:28:48,758
you think that person
should share it?

547
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:50,226
Jesus, Angel.

548
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,794
Just because you married her
doesn't mean you own her.

549
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:54,797
It's her money.
End of story.

550
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:56,432
Well, you got a dead body
waiting for you.

551
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,477
Oh, fuck me.

552
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:08,678
Why couldn't he have
just hanged himself,

553
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:09,679
took some pills...

554
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:11,347
Stuck his head in the oven?

555
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,316
People are so rude.
Excuse me.

556
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,684
You again.

557
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:16,152
It's my neighborhood.

558
00:29:16,186 --> 00:29:18,254
You were right
about the machete.

559
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,657
Good...I guess.

560
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,660
So what do we have here?

561
00:29:23,694 --> 00:29:24,827
Well, golly gee, Deb,

562
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:26,596
I think we got
a shotgun wound to the head.

563
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,932
Approximately 24 hours ago.

564
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:30,466
Make sure you swab the gun.

565
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:32,201
And check his hands for GSR.

566
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:33,636
- I got it, I got it.
- I'm just checking.

567
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,204
Dexter usually
works cases like this.

568
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:36,339
We have an I.D.?

569
00:29:36,373 --> 00:29:38,808
According to this,
Francisco Alfaro.

570
00:29:38,842 --> 00:29:39,876
Hey, can we roll him over?

571
00:29:44,148 --> 00:29:46,349
Oh, looks like his face
has changed a little

572
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:48,351
since his driver's license
picture was taken.

573
00:29:51,555 --> 00:29:53,823
Looks like him.

574
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:56,392
Hey...Check out the girl.

575
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:57,827
- What?
- Look at her.

576
00:29:57,861 --> 00:30:00,129
Imagine she has no eyes
and no tongue.

577
00:30:00,164 --> 00:30:01,798
- Holy shit.
- It's her, isn't it?

578
00:30:01,832 --> 00:30:03,066
Those are the exact,
same earrings.

579
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,201
We've got our head.

580
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:06,469
Uh-huh.

581
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:08,504
Bingo... looks like we got
a murder-suicide here.

582
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:10,006
- How you figure?
- Well...

583
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,208
Guy gets pissed at his wife.
Cuts her head off.

584
00:30:12,242 --> 00:30:14,210
Leaves it in the park
for everyone to see.

585
00:30:14,244 --> 00:30:16,512
And comes home,
blows his head off.

586
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:18,214
Masuka, we got some
brain goo on the ceiling

587
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:19,582
you need to photograph.

588
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,284
Oh, fuck me up the goat ass.

589
00:30:21,318 --> 00:30:25,188
What about all that
Santa Muerte stuff then?

590
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:27,323
Yeah...There is
no Santa Muerte stuff.

591
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,192
That's what I'm saying.
There was at the park.

592
00:30:29,226 --> 00:30:30,560
There was, uh, missing eyes
and a tongue

593
00:30:30,594 --> 00:30:32,228
and the gold candles
and the icons.

594
00:30:32,262 --> 00:30:35,498
There's none of that here.
No.

595
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:37,533
What do you think?

596
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,202
I think you're right.

597
00:30:39,236 --> 00:30:40,637
Who's she?

598
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:47,844
Hey...When is Dexter
coming back?

599
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:56,285
Boyd Fowler works
the 7:00 to 4:00 shift...

600
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,655
Which gives me time
to check out his house,

601
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:03,493
see if there's anything
that'll put him on my table.

602
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:05,395
Let me guess.

603
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:09,565
This is you putting on
your oxygen mask first.

604
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,367
Being on the hunt
keeps me sharp.

605
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,236
Focused.

606
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,671
Thus, the better killer I am,

607
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:16,172
the better father.

608
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:48,204
So he takes his work
home with him.

609
00:31:48,238 --> 00:31:49,372
No crime in that.

610
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,252
A man of simple taste.

611
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:08,491
Looks like
my grandmother's house.

612
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:13,796
A loaded hand gun.

613
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,398
A no-no
for a convicted felon.

614
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:17,233
But even so, not much to go on.

615
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:21,671
Boyd, you are very boring.

616
00:32:26,877 --> 00:32:28,244
Shit.

617
00:32:29,513 --> 00:32:31,781
Boyd comes home for lunch.

618
00:32:34,785 --> 00:32:36,519
Okay, that's interesting.

619
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,962
Do you want
to have control of your life?

620
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:49,899
You have that power.

621
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:53,069
You just have to learn
how to use it.

622
00:32:53,103 --> 00:32:55,271
You can make up
all the excuses you want.

623
00:32:55,305 --> 00:32:57,640
You're too tired.

624
00:32:57,674 --> 00:32:59,876
Who keeps their attic door
locked?

625
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:03,646
Too old.
Too fat.

626
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,281
Too stupid.

627
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:07,250
You know,
I've heard them all.

628
00:33:07,284 --> 00:33:08,951
Chicken noodle,
chicken noodle, chicken noodle.

629
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:10,586
Where's the tomato?

630
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:11,788
But if you want something...

631
00:33:11,822 --> 00:33:14,857
Take it!

632
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,993
You want that job?

633
00:33:17,027 --> 00:33:19,295
Well, then, take it!

634
00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:21,798
It's entirely up to you.

635
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:24,734
The world does not put one...

636
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:27,170
You want that nice house
on the beach?

637
00:33:27,204 --> 00:33:29,739
Take it!

638
00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:31,274
The world
does not put limitations

639
00:33:31,308 --> 00:33:32,909
on what you can have.

640
00:33:32,943 --> 00:33:34,777
But if you want something...

641
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,012
Take it!

642
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:37,747
You have that power.

643
00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:38,848
I can see having

644
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:42,585
an old girlfriend's
lock of hair...

645
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:44,587
But identified
only by a number?

646
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:47,857
We are our own worst enemy.

647
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:49,358
Make no mistake about it.

648
00:33:49,393 --> 00:33:51,360
But with a few simple steps,

649
00:33:51,395 --> 00:33:54,997
I can teach you how to take
control of your life.

650
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:56,566
Take it!

651
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,267
All I'm saying...

652
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,836
If a woman
pissed me off enough,

653
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,604
yeah, I'd wanna
cut her head off.

654
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:02,738
Well, that's great to hear.

655
00:34:02,773 --> 00:34:04,841
No, I'm not saying
I would do it.

656
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,909
But I understand the impulse.

657
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,311
What are we doing here?

658
00:34:08,345 --> 00:34:10,613
I told Dexter I'd
check this place out for him.

659
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,418
Oh! Come in, come in.

660
00:34:15,452 --> 00:34:16,652
- Hey.
- Hi!

661
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,054
Um, we've just painted

662
00:34:18,088 --> 00:34:20,723
and installed new flooring
throughout the house.

663
00:34:20,757 --> 00:34:22,425
Looks great.

664
00:34:22,459 --> 00:34:24,393
Lots of young couples
in the neighborhood.

665
00:34:24,428 --> 00:34:27,096
And the elementary school
is about three blocks away.

666
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,999
I'm sure you'd be
very happy here.

667
00:34:30,033 --> 00:34:31,267
Oh, it's not for us.

668
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:33,803
I think we'd be
very happy here too.

669
00:34:33,837 --> 00:34:35,605
Thank you.

670
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,007
Well, I have to get
a few things out of my car.

671
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,542
But if you have any questions,

672
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:40,977
I'll just be right outside.

673
00:34:41,011 --> 00:34:41,978
- Okay.
- Thank you.

674
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:47,617
- It's a nice kitchen.
- Uh-huh.

675
00:34:47,651 --> 00:34:50,887
- Decent appliances.
- Uh-huh.

676
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:53,222
Oh, look at this.

677
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,725
Great bedroom.
Check it out.

678
00:34:55,759 --> 00:34:57,059
Don't.

679
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:58,794
Ohh.

680
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:01,797
Wow.

681
00:35:01,832 --> 00:35:03,499
Comfy bed.

682
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:05,434
Feel it.

683
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:06,569
Get off the bed.

684
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:08,604
What do you say?
A little nap time?

685
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,773
- I'm leaving.
- What did I do?

686
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:12,108
I've got to drop you off
at the station,

687
00:35:12,142 --> 00:35:13,576
then pick up my brother's kids.

688
00:35:17,948 --> 00:35:20,049
How desperate am I
to follow Boyd

689
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:21,817
to the middle of nowhere
when all I've got

690
00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:23,920
is a bit of blood
and a lock of hair?

691
00:35:34,164 --> 00:35:36,732
But with nothing else
to go on...

692
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:57,086
It's a rule of nature.

693
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,822
Leave some old bedsprings
out in the middle of nowhere,

694
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:01,991
and soon, it'll be joined
by a refrigerator,

695
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:06,062
couch, car engine.

696
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:09,799
And now, a barrel, most likely
holding dead animals.

697
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,134
Too lazy to drive it back
to the incinerator, I suppose.

698
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:16,138
Hey, Deb.

699
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:17,239
Do you have the kids?

700
00:36:17,274 --> 00:36:19,175
Harrison's with Bill and Maura,

701
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:22,011
and...Astor and Cody
are...with you?

702
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:23,779
Shit.

703
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:24,914
What's going on?

704
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:26,882
Did you drop them off
at school this morning?

705
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:28,951
Yeah, they were
seeing the counselor first,

706
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,820
and then they were going
to their regular classes.

707
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:32,288
Well, I just went to go
pick them up,

708
00:36:32,322 --> 00:36:34,323
and the woman in the office said
that they never went to class.

709
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,426
So I called the apartment,
and there's no answer.

710
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,828
Well, where are they?

711
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:40,162
That's my question,
big brother.

712
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:41,330
Where would they go?

713
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,966
Same place Astor keeps
saying she wants to go.

714
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:49,572
Astor.

715
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:52,975
Cody.

716
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,387
Hey.

717
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,425
How'd you guys get here?

718
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:11,694
We walked.

719
00:37:11,728 --> 00:37:14,263
Don't be mad, Dexter.

720
00:37:14,297 --> 00:37:17,366
They wanted
to see where it happened.

721
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,834
Where they lost their mother.

722
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:22,271
I'm not mad.

723
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:23,506
Astor, I'm sorry.

724
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,540
I should have listened to you.

725
00:37:24,574 --> 00:37:25,608
I should
have brought you back here,

726
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:26,709
like you asked.

727
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:31,147
If you want to move back here,
then we will.

728
00:37:31,181 --> 00:37:32,248
We'll find a way
to make it work.

729
00:37:32,282 --> 00:37:33,783
No, we won't.

730
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:41,924
Astor, I'm sorry.

731
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:44,527
You keep saying that,
but I don't care.

732
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:46,095
You ruined everything.

733
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:48,364
We'd gotten used to it.
It wasn't that bad!

734
00:37:48,398 --> 00:37:49,398
Used to what?

735
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,434
To the way things were!

736
00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:53,069
Before you!
Without a dad!

737
00:37:53,103 --> 00:37:54,203
Oh.

738
00:37:54,237 --> 00:37:55,337
And then you come along

739
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:56,772
and become
a part of the family,

740
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,974
and we thought that everything
was gonna be good forever.

741
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:04,180
You made us think that!

742
00:38:04,214 --> 00:38:06,482
And it's not true.

743
00:38:06,516 --> 00:38:09,085
Things got worse.

744
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,687
And now every time
I look at you, I get so angry,

745
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:15,524
because it was all just a lie.

746
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,661
It's not Dexter's fault.

747
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,432
I thought coming here
would help.

748
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,735
But that was stupid.

749
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,738
No, I understand.

750
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:32,641
It looks exactly
the same as before.

751
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,180
It does.

752
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:41,984
You can't even
tell what happened.

753
00:38:42,018 --> 00:38:44,386
But I know my mom died there.

754
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:46,288
And things will never
be the same.

755
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:47,623
I miss her so much.

756
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:48,858
I do too.

757
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,761
We all do.

758
00:38:52,796 --> 00:38:54,630
I don't want to live with you.

759
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:56,432
I want to live
with grandma and grandpa.

760
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:57,766
I want to go back
with them tonight.

761
00:38:57,801 --> 00:38:58,968
Right now!

762
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,787
Hey.
I'm, uh, heading out.

763
00:39:18,822 --> 00:39:19,822
You want to grab
a bite somewhere?

764
00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:21,290
No, why would I wanna do that?

765
00:39:21,324 --> 00:39:23,058
All right.

766
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:29,465
Hey, lieutenant.

767
00:39:29,499 --> 00:39:31,767
Deb told me about
the Kyle Butler sketches.

768
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:34,203
Yeah, well, I'm not sure
how useful they'll be.

769
00:39:34,237 --> 00:39:35,271
The mother and two children

770
00:39:35,305 --> 00:39:39,141
all gave very different
versions.

771
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:40,609
- Huh.
- It's their biggest lead.

772
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:43,045
Seems to be going nowhere.

773
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:44,780
Do you mind if I keep
a copy of these?

774
00:39:44,814 --> 00:39:46,315
No, I got plenty.

775
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:55,524
Angel.

776
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,360
Let me ask you a question.

777
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:00,462
Can you tell me
why you kept his much money

778
00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:03,432
a secret from me?

779
00:40:05,268 --> 00:40:07,670
It was never a secret.

780
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:09,138
That's my retirement fund.

781
00:40:09,172 --> 00:40:10,339
Well, now that we're married,

782
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:11,407
aren't we supposed
to share everything?

783
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:12,975
I don't think
we ever discussed that.

784
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:14,176
Then maybe
we have different ideas

785
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,011
about what a marriage
should be.

786
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:19,582
Because I always pictured
you and I at 80 years old,

787
00:40:19,616 --> 00:40:22,017
walking down the beach,
hand in hand.

788
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:26,355
I like to picture that
as well, Angel.

789
00:40:26,389 --> 00:40:27,356
I love you.

790
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:30,226
But I think maybe I have
more of a...

791
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,493
Practical side than you do.

792
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:32,661
What does that mean?

793
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,597
I mean I've worked
my entire career

794
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:36,465
to save up, to protect myself,

795
00:40:36,499 --> 00:40:38,667
and you live every day
like it's a party.

796
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:41,237
It's one of the things
I like about you,

797
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:43,305
but it also means
that you spend money

798
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,506
faster than you even make it.

799
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:46,041
- Okay!
- And it's, I'm...

800
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:49,311
Okay, I get it.

801
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:51,013
I don't mean to hurt
your feelings.

802
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:52,815
No, I'm fine.

803
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:53,882
I'm irresponsible.

804
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:54,984
Oh, Maria.

805
00:40:55,018 --> 00:40:56,218
Everyone knows that.

806
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:02,891
Hey, everyone!

807
00:41:02,926 --> 00:41:04,026
Drinks on me.

808
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,394
Tonight.

809
00:41:05,428 --> 00:41:06,795
Yeah! Angel!

810
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,330
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.

811
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,099
Angel.

812
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,769
Hey.

813
00:41:17,841 --> 00:41:20,209
So everyone's home safe?

814
00:41:20,243 --> 00:41:22,811
Yeah, they're all inside.

815
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:28,851
You think they're finally
settling in?

816
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:31,954
They're packing.

817
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:35,057
What do you mean?

818
00:41:35,091 --> 00:41:38,661
Astor and Cody are...
leaving.

819
00:41:38,695 --> 00:41:39,928
Soon as their grandparents
get here,

820
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:41,664
they're going back to Orlando
with them.

821
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:48,304
Dex, I'm so sorry.

822
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:52,908
For how long?

823
00:41:52,942 --> 00:41:55,444
I don't know.

824
00:41:55,478 --> 00:41:57,146
Well, maybe if
I talk to Astor...

825
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,049
I already tried.

826
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,550
And Cody wants to go too?

827
00:42:01,584 --> 00:42:05,654
No, he wants to stay.

828
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,457
It got...very upsetting.

829
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:10,326
What did you say?

830
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:14,296
I reminded him that you and I
are brother and sister,

831
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,397
just like him and Astor,

832
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:16,965
and that it's...

833
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,135
Important that they
never split up.

834
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:27,042
All the shit
we've been through.

835
00:42:29,145 --> 00:42:31,847
I never would have
made it through without you.

836
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:38,320
That's what I tried
to tell him.

837
00:42:40,123 --> 00:42:41,357
Did it help?

838
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:43,158
Not really.

839
00:42:45,028 --> 00:42:49,264
I really was trying...

840
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:51,233
To make it work.

841
00:42:53,303 --> 00:42:54,770
In my own way.

842
00:42:54,804 --> 00:42:56,071
Yeah, I know you were.

843
00:43:01,544 --> 00:43:04,146
I guess it's time
to face reality.

844
00:43:22,098 --> 00:43:23,599
Reality.

845
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:29,438
Quinn.

846
00:43:29,472 --> 00:43:31,206
Okay, we had sex.

847
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:34,376
Was it good sex?

848
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:37,212
I've said all I'm gonna say.

849
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,148
Are we gonna have more sex?

850
00:43:39,182 --> 00:43:40,182
Good-bye.

851
00:43:40,216 --> 00:43:41,183
Come on.

852
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:42,518
Help me out here.

853
00:43:42,552 --> 00:43:45,354
I'm hanging up now.

854
00:44:01,738 --> 00:44:03,372
She wants to live her life

855
00:44:03,406 --> 00:44:05,007
stashing away
all her little pennies,

856
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:06,375
that's... that's her problem.

857
00:44:06,409 --> 00:44:09,144
I can't do anything about that.

858
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,246
You know?

859
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:12,948
You want another drink?

860
00:44:12,982 --> 00:44:14,450
You buying, right?

861
00:44:14,484 --> 00:44:16,919
Bartender, a cuervo silver.

862
00:44:16,953 --> 00:44:19,455
You know how much
money she's got? It's sick.

863
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:22,925
You tell me.
Will you tell me?

864
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:24,159
Cheers.

865
00:44:27,163 --> 00:44:28,397
Angel.

866
00:44:31,067 --> 00:44:34,303
It true you married
Maria Laguerta?

867
00:44:34,337 --> 00:44:35,437
I did indeed.

868
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:39,942
You got yourself
a little sugar mama.

869
00:44:42,512 --> 00:44:43,512
What?

870
00:44:43,546 --> 00:44:44,680
Oh, yeah.

871
00:44:44,714 --> 00:44:46,748
I remember when she was
first starting out.

872
00:44:46,783 --> 00:44:48,217
Such a fine piece of ass.

873
00:44:48,251 --> 00:44:49,751
I think you need to get
the hell out of here.

874
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:54,256
You fuck!

875
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:55,524
Uhh!

876
00:44:55,558 --> 00:44:56,725
Uhh!

877
00:44:56,759 --> 00:44:58,126
Aah!

878
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:18,547
If they need anything,
just let me know; I'll send it.

879
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:20,115
We will.
Thank you.

880
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,087
I lost my innocence

881
00:45:25,121 --> 00:45:26,822
at such an early age.

882
00:45:26,856 --> 00:45:29,258
And it left
a very damaging mark.

883
00:45:32,295 --> 00:45:35,163
Can't I stay with you, Dexter?

884
00:45:35,198 --> 00:45:39,434
For now, you need
to go with your grandparents.

885
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:41,503
Don't worry, we'll still
see each other all the time.

886
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,472
Orlando's not so far.

887
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,608
Yes, it is.

888
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:47,843
Any shrink could tell you

889
00:45:47,877 --> 00:45:49,311
that's why I've always
liked children.

890
00:45:49,345 --> 00:45:53,682
Because they connect me
to what I can never get back.

891
00:45:53,716 --> 00:45:56,118
I don't want to go, Dexter.

892
00:45:58,955 --> 00:46:00,389
I don't want you to go.

893
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:14,169
Astor...

894
00:46:14,203 --> 00:46:16,138
What?

895
00:46:20,076 --> 00:46:24,513
Your mother loved you more
than you could ever imagine.

896
00:46:24,547 --> 00:46:26,381
And I...

897
00:46:31,487 --> 00:46:33,755
Me too.

898
00:47:00,483 --> 00:47:01,883
Cody and Astor showed me

899
00:47:01,918 --> 00:47:05,153
that I can still care
about something.

900
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:07,956
That makes letting them go
all that much harder.

901
00:47:23,172 --> 00:47:24,940
And it's losing them
that makes me realize

902
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:27,743
there must be some small part
of that innocent child

903
00:47:27,777 --> 00:47:30,779
still inside me.

904
00:47:38,154 --> 00:47:39,287
Because, just like Astor,

905
00:47:39,322 --> 00:47:41,123
I was foolish enough
to think that things

906
00:47:41,157 --> 00:47:44,092
would always be good.

907
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,327
But they're not.

908
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,806
They're worse.

909
00:48:07,483 --> 00:48:10,252
Much worse.

910
00:48:10,286 --> 00:48:13,755
Normally, having a target
would make me feel good.

911
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,424
Give me direction.

912
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:16,558
A sense of purpose.

913
00:48:16,592 --> 00:48:17,993
But now...

914
00:48:22,965 --> 00:48:25,233
It means nothing.

915
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:30,272
And I don't know what's
going to make me feel better.

916
00:48:30,306 --> 00:48:33,642
Should we go home?

917
00:48:33,676 --> 00:48:36,311
Give me a minute.

918
00:48:36,345 --> 00:48:46,449
