2
00:01:46,892 --> 00:01:47,858
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,927
He's calling me over.

4
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:51,662
Officer Manzon, go to him.

5
00:01:51,697 --> 00:01:53,197
Lieutenant, no,
this is a problem.

6
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:54,365
These guys are dangerous.

7
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,733
Stand down, Morgan.

8
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:02,807
Drop the gun now!

9
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:06,644
Our informant, Yasmin Aragon,

10
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:07,878
was shot and killed.

11
00:02:07,913 --> 00:02:09,280
This is a fucking disaster.

12
00:02:09,314 --> 00:02:10,781
If mistakes were made,

13
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,216
they most certainly
were not mine.

14
00:02:13,785 --> 00:02:15,519
I just gave you 500 bucks.

15
00:02:15,554 --> 00:02:16,887
And I told you about the girl.

16
00:02:16,922 --> 00:02:18,823
But if you want
to find out who she is,

17
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:21,692
where she's from, and what
she's doing in that damn house,

18
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:23,160
you're gonna have to pay.

19
00:02:23,195 --> 00:02:25,229
Boyd wasn't the only one
who did this to me.

20
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:26,664
There were others.

21
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:30,801
Besides the ones that we've
already taken care of,

22
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:32,136
Suit and Tie.

23
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,404
He'd take off his jacket

24
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:35,906
and fold it very carefully,

25
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:37,775
like he didn't
want to mess it up.

26
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:40,010
Someone tried to move
the girls in the barrels.

27
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:44,448
- Where's the driver?
- He took off.

28
00:02:44,483 --> 00:02:46,417
That means
he's still mine to find.

29
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:48,385
You're never gonna guess
who this truck is registered to.

30
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,321
Jordan Chase.

31
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:52,022
Nice to meet you.

32
00:02:52,057 --> 00:02:53,124
Do you know this man?

33
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,561
That's the guy
who folded his jacket.

34
00:02:57,596 --> 00:02:58,896
His name's Cole Harmon.

35
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,766
He's Jordan Chase's
head of security.

36
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,300
- That's Cole.
- And Boyd.

37
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:04,468
And Dan the dentist.

38
00:03:04,503 --> 00:03:07,037
It's them
from, like, 15 years ago.

39
00:03:07,072 --> 00:03:09,273
What does this mean?

40
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:16,846
? ?

41
00:03:20,184 --> 00:03:24,221
We are born primal.

42
00:03:26,691 --> 00:03:29,626
Conceived with the impulse
to fight...

43
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:32,396
For what we desire.

44
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,802
It's written in our genes.

45
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:42,506
It's engraved in our souls.

46
00:03:44,776 --> 00:03:47,844
But we've traded
the wilderness for pavement,

47
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,247
trees for skyscrapers.

48
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:53,216
We've lost touch
with our instincts,

49
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:54,718
with what we are.

50
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:59,656
We have fallen
from nature's grace.

51
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:01,892
But we shall be delivered!

52
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:12,936
It's time to tap
into your primal selves

53
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,173
and seize the power
of instinct.

54
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:20,177
We're gonna cast off
those shackles

55
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:22,646
that bind us to jobs we hate,

56
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,581
people we don't love,

57
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:27,884
lives that aren't worth living.

58
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,787
We are going to...

59
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:32,489
Take it!

60
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,424
I've never been
around so many people

61
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:36,426
that made me feel normal.

62
00:04:38,463 --> 00:04:39,563
Yeah!

63
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:40,897
Yeah!

64
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:42,566
Really normal.

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,768
- The power of risk!
- Take it!

66
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:46,103
The power of desire.

67
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:47,270
Take it!

68
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:48,438
The power of instinct.

69
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:49,673
Take it!

70
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,275
Instincts
are all I've ever had.

71
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,745
Cole Harmon,
Chase's chief of security...

72
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:57,614
Torturer, rapist, killer.

73
00:04:57,648 --> 00:04:59,916
It's time to tap
into my primal self.

74
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,952
- The power of life!
- Take it!

75
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:03,787
- We're gonna take it!
- Take it!

76
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:05,489
- Take it!
- Take it!

77
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:06,823
- Take it!
- Take it!

78
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:07,924
All right.

79
00:05:10,862 --> 00:05:12,195
Lieutenant Laguerta!

80
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,630
Lieutenant,
multiple rounds were fired

81
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:15,532
at the recent
Club Mayan shootout.

82
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,000
Was Miami Metro responsible

83
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:19,069
for the deaths
of innocent bystanders?

84
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:20,470
I have nothing to say
at this time.

85
00:05:20,505 --> 00:05:21,738
Excuse me.

86
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:23,106
Do you agree
with the Mayor's assessment?

87
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:25,008
Did this operation needlessly
put people at risk?

88
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:27,210
Every undercover operation
is high risk.

89
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:28,745
Is there going to be
an independent investigation

90
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,347
- of the shooting?
- No comment.

91
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:32,816
Have you personally
retained counsel?

92
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,017
Counsel?

93
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:35,552
Isn't it true
the victims' families

94
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:39,055
have filed a civil lawsuit?

95
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,557
Let me through.
Excuse me.

96
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,058
Let me through.

97
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:45,862
Lieutenant Laguerta
neither confirming nor denying

98
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:47,464
Miami Metro's culpability

99
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:49,099
in the recent Club Mayan
shootout.

100
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:52,102
As we know, two innocent people
are dead, six...

101
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:54,571
Did ballistics come in?

102
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,339
It's good news.
Bullets from the victims' bodies

103
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:58,508
belong to the Fuentes brothers,
not us.

104
00:05:58,543 --> 00:06:00,877
That is good news,

105
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:02,446
but this is far from over.

106
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,014
I'm sure you all heard
the Mayor's statement.

107
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:06,650
A prime example of how shit
just rolls downhill.

108
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:07,751
He should have
kept his mouth shut

109
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:09,085
until all the facts came out.

110
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,555
He was right.
This operation was too risky,

111
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:13,190
and now because of us,

112
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:15,292
two innocent people are dead.

113
00:06:15,326 --> 00:06:16,359
Not by our bullets.

114
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:18,261
Shots would have
never been fired

115
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:20,096
if we hadn't been set up
on that club.

116
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:21,198
Those are the facts.

117
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:22,966
On the up side,
Carlos Fuentes is dead,

118
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,604
none of us
should have any illusions.

119
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,272
There are gonna be
consequences.

120
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,780
Yeah, I've seen
that look on her face before.

121
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:39,082
Someone's about
to get bent over and fucked.

122
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:40,617
It's gonna be me, isn't it?

123
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,052
I screwed up.

124
00:06:42,086 --> 00:06:44,020
No, you didn't.
You were following orders.

125
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:46,056
Laguerta's orders,
just like the rest of us.

126
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,724
That's what you put
in your report, right?

127
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:49,292
You were following her lead?

128
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:51,294
I haven't written it yet.

129
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:53,497
I'm still sorting
through the events in my mind.

130
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:55,365
Sorting through what exactly?

131
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,800
What I'm gonna say about them.

132
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,635
Here's a crazy idea.
How about the truth?

133
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,704
Deb, I'm on it.

134
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:11,214
Who's that?

135
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:13,183
It's Yasmin's mother.

136
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:17,287
You all right?

137
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:18,922
Three people are dead...

138
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:20,924
Carlos Fuentes and two girls.

139
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,826
Nobody's crying about Carlos.

140
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,227
Fuentes was a scumbag.

141
00:07:24,262 --> 00:07:26,963
Yeah, he's a scumbag
that I shot and killed.

142
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:28,565
And?

143
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:30,166
What's the problem?

144
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:33,003
Don't tell me you feel bad
about killing him.

145
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:36,806
I don't.

146
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:38,608
That's the problem.

147
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:50,854
Yasmin didn't feel any pain.

148
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,091
She died instantly.

149
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:02,265
I'm ready.

150
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,266
Okay.

151
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:16,813
I have some bad news
for everyone.

152
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:21,751
You're all going to die.

153
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:23,253
Some of us sooner than others.

154
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:25,555
Some of us sooner than others.

155
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,258
And if you're not in touch
with your primal self,

156
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:29,993
you're already dead.

157
00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:32,162
You may be breathing
and walking around,

158
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:33,463
but you're an empty shell,

159
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:34,831
one of the herd,

160
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:38,268
completely unaware
of what you truly want.

161
00:08:38,302 --> 00:08:39,970
And when we come back,

162
00:08:40,004 --> 00:08:41,938
we're gonna start using
your instincts

163
00:08:41,973 --> 00:08:44,741
to design the life
that you deserve,

164
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,110
fuel the passion
to make it real,

165
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:49,646
and find the power...

166
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,648
To take it.

167
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:57,320
Jordan Chase's
"Take It Now" experience

168
00:08:57,355 --> 00:08:59,122
will resume at 2:00 P.M.

169
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:02,859
In the meantime, we invite you
to visit our vendors.

170
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,062
Jordan promises change,

171
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:08,398
but he also
accepts credit cards.

172
00:09:12,837 --> 00:09:13,837
Lumen?

173
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:15,005
Can you talk?

174
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,974
Or are you about to have
a major life revelation?

175
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:19,809
No, that came
around 9:00 A.M.

176
00:09:19,844 --> 00:09:21,678
when I realized
I really wanted a doughnut.

177
00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:23,747
What'd you find?

178
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:25,315
I haven't been able to find out

179
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:27,117
how these guys know each other.

180
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:29,686
The picture was taken
when they were teenagers, but...

181
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,021
Did you check high schools?

182
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:34,090
Cole went to Westland Prep
in Hialeah,

183
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,625
and Dan the dentist went to

184
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,961
St. Joseph's Academy
in Coral Gables.

185
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,196
Boyd...
There's nothing on Boyd.

186
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,798
Yeah, he probably never saw

187
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,533
the inside
of too many classrooms.

188
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:46,169
I was able to find out
something else about Cole.

189
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:48,204
- What?
- He was in the Marines.

190
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:50,740
He got bounced
on dishonorable discharge.

191
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:52,208
He beat up a superior officer

192
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:53,610
and put him in the hospital.

193
00:09:53,644 --> 00:09:55,278
This is
a dangerous guy, Dexter.

194
00:09:55,312 --> 00:09:57,514
Do you remember the marks
I had on my back?

195
00:09:57,548 --> 00:10:00,350
That was Cole.

196
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:01,484
So be careful.

197
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,287
You getting any rest?

198
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:10,393
I fall into a deep sleep
from 1:00 to 1:15 every morning.

199
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:13,430
When this is over,
I expect to sleep for a year.

200
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,534
I'll talk to you later.

201
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:19,469
Mr. Morgan.
Cole Harmon.

202
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:22,305
I'm sure you remember me
from our visit to the station.

203
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:24,174
Mr. Chase spotted you
from the stage.

204
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,642
He's very interested
in speaking with you.

205
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:27,043
He was wondering
if you'd join him

206
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:28,211
in his suite for a few minutes.

207
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:30,146
Uh...Okay.

208
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:31,214
When?

209
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:32,515
How about right now?

210
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:39,422
All the way to the end.

211
00:10:51,268 --> 00:10:53,803
To the left.

212
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:02,712
I'm disgusted,
to tell you the truth.

213
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:03,913
You haven't been listening
to a word I've said.

214
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:08,051
Call me back when you stop
being a piece of furniture.

215
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,120
Sorry.

216
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:11,688
New client.

217
00:11:11,722 --> 00:11:13,256
Good to see you again,
Mr. Morgan,

218
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,024
especially under
better circumstances.

219
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:16,126
Call me Dexter.

220
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,293
Jordan.

221
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:18,595
Can I offer you a drink?

222
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:21,798
Uh, no, thanks.
I'm good.

223
00:11:21,832 --> 00:11:23,433
- Think I know why you're here.
- You do?

224
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:26,870
You're searching for a way
to cope with your loss.

225
00:11:26,904 --> 00:11:28,304
I know your history, Dexter.

226
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:30,774
I thought I recognized you
when we met at the station,

227
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:32,776
but it hit me later on.

228
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,010
You wife was murdered.

229
00:11:34,044 --> 00:11:35,678
Yes.

230
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:37,113
They any closer
to catching Trinity?

231
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:40,316
Not that I'm aware of.

232
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:42,619
I followed that case
very closely.

233
00:11:42,653 --> 00:11:44,554
Trinity... a religious man,

234
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:46,456
family, good life.

235
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,691
Yet he was working
through such rage,

236
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:50,593
harboring so many secrets.

237
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:52,529
I have to be honest.
He fascinated me

238
00:11:52,563 --> 00:11:53,763
on a deep level.

239
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:55,932
What else do Jordan
and I have in common?

240
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,968
I certainly don't mean
to imply any sympathy for him.

241
00:11:59,003 --> 00:12:03,006
He's a monster, no question.

242
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,941
I can't imagine
your frustration,

243
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:08,178
knowing he's out there,
unpunished.

244
00:12:08,212 --> 00:12:10,180
It hasn't been easy.

245
00:12:10,214 --> 00:12:12,115
No doubt.

246
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,349
And now you're a single father,

247
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:14,784
which has its own set
of challenges.

248
00:12:19,523 --> 00:12:20,990
Why did you want to see me?

249
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:23,660
I've developed a theory
on how the primal self

250
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:25,829
deals with tragedy.

251
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,032
I have to prepare
for the next session,

252
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:30,900
but I am very interested
in what happened to you.

253
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:33,169
I would like to discuss
your situation in depth

254
00:12:33,204 --> 00:12:35,305
at another time
if you're open to that.

255
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,041
Okay.

256
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:39,442
Okay.

257
00:12:39,476 --> 00:12:41,311
By the way, have you made
any progress on Boyd Fowler?

258
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:44,414
I'm not really aware
of all the details.

259
00:12:44,448 --> 00:12:46,482
You should probably speak
to one of the detectives.

260
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:47,984
Of course.

261
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,986
I look forward
to our next talk.

262
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:57,894
There's a little something
in there for Harrison.

263
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:04,901
Thanks.

264
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:15,578
You wanted to see me?

265
00:13:15,613 --> 00:13:17,146
Close the door.

266
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,925
You know there's a lot of heat
coming down on us,

267
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,594
and the public's
demanding blood. Our blood.

268
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:34,864
Matthews wants someone's head.

269
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,933
Sounds like
Santa Muerta's catching on.

270
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:41,404
I'm putting Cira Manzon
on disciplinary leave.

271
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:43,206
What?

272
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,908
I need to put a face on it.

273
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:46,542
What's wrong with your face?

274
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:47,577
Detective...

275
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:50,246
You can't pin this on her.

276
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:52,048
Her actions precipitated
the shooting.

277
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,416
She wasn't even
supposed to be there.

278
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,218
I tried to take her off,
and you wouldn't let me.

279
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,252
That's your impression.

280
00:13:56,287 --> 00:13:59,322
No, that's what happened.

281
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:01,424
Look, I was
the detective in charge,

282
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,093
so if you want to fuck
somebody over,

283
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:05,228
here's your scapegoat.

284
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,963
I know your instinct

285
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:08,564
is to take the fall
for your team.

286
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,099
You're on my team.

287
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:12,769
In fact, you fuckin'
took over my team,

288
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:13,970
and I had your back,

289
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:15,004
'cause your team, my team,
whatever,

290
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,005
it's all the fuckin' same.

291
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,041
Cira's just starting out.

292
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:21,110
Her career will take
the smallest hit.

293
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:23,046
She'll recover quickly.

294
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,415
If something like that
had happened to me back then,

295
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,116
I never would have
made detective.

296
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:29,852
We were all there together.

297
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,255
So why can't we just hold tight

298
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:35,692
and weather
the fuckin' storm together?

299
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:37,193
Fuckin' think about it.

300
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:54,744
Does your printer ever work?

301
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:55,878
Lu?

302
00:14:57,781 --> 00:14:59,415
Owen.

303
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:02,418
How are you?

304
00:15:02,453 --> 00:15:04,053
Um...

305
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:06,089
Um...

306
00:15:06,123 --> 00:15:08,091
I bet you're tan.

307
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,193
The sun feels closer here,

308
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:12,161
even though I know it actually
physically is not,

309
00:15:12,196 --> 00:15:14,130
it feels like it's right there.

310
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,231
You're in Miami?

311
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:19,068
I got a sunburn
just renting the car.

312
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:22,972
I came to see you.

313
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:24,674
You did?

314
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,609
Lu, I've respected your wishes.

315
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:27,844
Since the day of the wedding,

316
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:28,945
I haven't called,
I haven't emailed,

317
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:31,214
I haven't even texted.

318
00:15:31,248 --> 00:15:33,116
It's like my life
stopped that day

319
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,484
when you left,

320
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:37,120
and I need to get unstuck.

321
00:15:37,154 --> 00:15:40,490
I feel the way to do that
is to see you, face to face,

322
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:43,059
without 75 of our closest
friends and family

323
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:45,328
staring at us.

324
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,163
Please, will you see me?

325
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,902
I...Ahem.

326
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:54,270
I can't tonight.

327
00:15:54,304 --> 00:15:56,372
Tomorrow.

328
00:15:58,442 --> 00:16:00,309
Lu?

329
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:02,545
I'm staying at
the Blue Pelican Motel.

330
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:03,980
There's a cafe
across the street.

331
00:16:04,014 --> 00:16:05,648
Meet me there tomorrow
at noon, okay?

332
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:07,450
Okay, noon.

333
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,686
Hey.

334
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,188
Hey.

335
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,556
I got you some supper.

336
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,625
Hot and sour soup,
fried rice with tofu.

337
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:17,260
That's what you like, right?

338
00:16:17,294 --> 00:16:19,662
Yeah, it's fine.

339
00:16:21,498 --> 00:16:23,499
No, I'm not staying.

340
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:25,768
Oh, right.

341
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:27,170
Harrison.

342
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:31,641
You're tired.

343
00:16:31,675 --> 00:16:33,643
I spent the entire day

344
00:16:33,677 --> 00:16:35,411
staring at that laptop,

345
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:38,247
and I got exactly nowhere.

346
00:16:38,282 --> 00:16:39,682
Well, the good news is

347
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:41,851
you won't be
on that computer tomorrow.

348
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:43,352
I have something
I need you to do.

349
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:44,654
What?

350
00:16:44,688 --> 00:16:46,189
- Shopping.
- What kind of shopping?

351
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:48,558
Supplies.
We have to make a room

352
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:51,260
where Cole will be dispatched.

353
00:16:51,295 --> 00:16:53,129
It has to be covered
in plastic.

354
00:16:53,163 --> 00:16:54,230
So does Cole.

355
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,500
To catch the blood.

356
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:00,369
I made a list.

357
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:06,742
Duct tape, 30 yards
of clear polyethylene sheeting.

358
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:09,512
And garbage bags,
three mil, black.

359
00:17:11,148 --> 00:17:12,515
When are you gonna do it?

360
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:14,117
Tomorrow.

361
00:17:14,151 --> 00:17:16,185
I booked a room
right next to Cole's.

362
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,920
You're gonna do it
in the hotel?

363
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,622
No choice.

364
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:21,958
Jordan's next gig
is in Sarasota.

365
00:17:21,992 --> 00:17:23,392
He and Cole will be
hitting the road

366
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:24,694
right after the seminar ends.

367
00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:31,834
So tomorrow night's the night.

368
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:33,503
There's a parking lot
right on the corner

369
00:17:33,537 --> 00:17:35,037
of Fourth and Bay.

370
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:36,506
Meet me there tomorrow at noon,

371
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,907
and I'll pick up the supplies.

372
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:40,877
1:00 would be better,

373
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:43,279
just so I have
enough time to shop.

374
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,648
Sure.

375
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:46,883
What?

376
00:17:48,452 --> 00:17:51,387
A few months ago, I was
shopping for a wedding dress,

377
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:53,956
and now I'm shopping for...

378
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:57,460
30 yards
of polyethylene sheeting.

379
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:58,895
It's crazy, isn't it,

380
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:03,232
how quickly you can get used
to the supremely weird?

381
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:05,067
Tell me about it.

382
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:17,613
- Thanks for covering.
- No problem.

383
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:19,415
Sonya just left.

384
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,353
Uch. Jordan Chase.

385
00:18:24,388 --> 00:18:28,491
I know you're hurting,
so I'll reserve judgment,

386
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,126
but I gotta draw
the line somewhere.

387
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,894
It was free.

388
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,098
It can't hurt, can it?

389
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:37,500
Maybe I'll come away
with something.

390
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,535
Yeah, a really ugly onesie.

391
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,270
I don't know.

392
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:44,240
If it's working, who am I
to poop on your parade?

393
00:18:44,274 --> 00:18:47,076
And your day?

394
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,880
I've got six mandatory
sessions with a shrink

395
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:53,482
coming at me
because of Carlos Fuentes.

396
00:18:55,152 --> 00:18:57,587
Feels like a big, fat
fucking waste of time, too.

397
00:18:57,621 --> 00:18:59,355
I mean, I'd kill that fucktard
all over again.

398
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,757
I'd empty
a fucking magazine in him.

399
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:07,163
Okay.

400
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:08,965
Maybe that's something
worth talking about.

401
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:13,970
I always thought
if I landed a bullet

402
00:19:14,004 --> 00:19:16,105
that it would bother me.

403
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,377
That it would...

404
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:24,614
It would be a burden
to take another life.

405
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,619
They don't issue guns
to lab geeks,

406
00:19:29,653 --> 00:19:31,420
so you have no idea
what I'm talking about.

407
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,857
I can imagine.

408
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:36,325
I don't feel bad.

409
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,194
Me, of all people.

410
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:40,730
I don't feel anything.

411
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:47,970
Maybe I've just run out.

412
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:51,307
Dad once told me that...

413
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:55,278
Some people deserve to die.

414
00:19:58,882 --> 00:20:00,116
You believe that?

415
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:04,387
You believe some people
deserve to die?

416
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:07,156
Some people don't
deserve to live.

417
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,192
Trinity should be dead.

418
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:11,794
Not Rita, not Lundy.

419
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:17,733
Maybe the world is better off

420
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:19,602
without Carlos Fuentes.

421
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:27,643
I'd pretty much given up hope.

422
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:31,380
I figured I was destined
to go through life alone,

423
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:33,082
and then I started listening
to one of your CDs.

424
00:20:33,116 --> 00:20:34,684
<i>The primal Self?</i>

425
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:37,253
I started listening
in the car on the way to work.

426
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:38,554
Three weeks later,

427
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:39,922
I met my soul mate,

428
00:20:39,956 --> 00:20:41,490
and now we have
a baby on the way!

429
00:20:43,393 --> 00:20:44,360
Come on up here.

430
00:20:44,394 --> 00:20:45,995
Come on!
Come on, honey!

431
00:20:54,237 --> 00:20:55,705
Cole will be at his post

432
00:20:55,739 --> 00:20:57,039
for the rest of the session.

433
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:58,541
That gives me an hour.

434
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:33,576
I'll have to do this
in the dark.

435
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,579
14 steps to the pillow,

436
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:39,648
give him the needle,
and drag him to my room.

437
00:21:39,683 --> 00:21:40,983
60 seconds tops.

438
00:21:46,123 --> 00:21:49,125
Jordan's about to lose
his number one fan.

439
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:03,672
- Oh.
- Sorry.

440
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:04,840
No, no, it's me.

441
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,175
Really.

442
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:09,211
You look beautiful.

443
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:11,414
I don't, really.

444
00:22:11,448 --> 00:22:12,515
You do.

445
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:14,884
You always do.

446
00:22:19,156 --> 00:22:20,956
Miami suits you.

447
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:23,125
You must love
all these Art Deco buildings.

448
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,561
Can't get enough of 'em.

449
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:30,366
Steph had her baby.

450
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,734
Oh, that's right.

451
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,469
She was due last month.

452
00:22:33,503 --> 00:22:37,706
Yes. Meet Mavis.

453
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:39,475
Look at her.

454
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:41,110
Mavis?

455
00:22:41,144 --> 00:22:42,511
Mark's grandmother.

456
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:44,280
The name came down
to Mavis or Madison.

457
00:22:44,314 --> 00:22:45,448
Madison.

458
00:22:45,482 --> 00:22:46,882
Your niece could
have been named

459
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:50,152
after the city where you and I
did our Sunday beer runs.

460
00:22:50,187 --> 00:22:52,288
Cooler heads prevailed...
mine.

461
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:55,090
How is Steph doing?

462
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,525
She's tired,

463
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,394
glad to not be pregnant
anymore,

464
00:22:58,428 --> 00:23:00,095
cries at commercials...

465
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,132
And is transcendently happy.

466
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:06,335
Your parents miss you.

467
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:09,004
They'd like to know
that you're safe.

468
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,274
You can tell them.

469
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:15,811
Well, I'm thinking
of not going back, too.

470
00:23:15,846 --> 00:23:16,912
What?

471
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:18,614
You were right.

472
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,783
We were trapped in our jobs,
trapped in that city.

473
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,651
We'd have been trapped
in a life we didn't want.

474
00:23:22,686 --> 00:23:23,919
It's time for that to change.

475
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,890
Owen?

476
00:23:27,924 --> 00:23:29,758
Lu...

477
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:31,660
I bought these
round the world tickets.

478
00:23:31,695 --> 00:23:33,028
Broke the bank.

479
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:35,764
We can literally hop on
and hop off in any city.

480
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:38,367
I love you.

481
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:41,937
No matter what you do,
whoever you are,

482
00:23:41,972 --> 00:23:43,906
I want to take
this journey with you.

483
00:23:49,446 --> 00:23:51,180
Have you met someone?

484
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:53,048
I've met a lot of people here,

485
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,518
but not like you're thinking.

486
00:23:55,552 --> 00:23:57,987
I can't just leave.

487
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:02,024
Me showing up like this
is sudden, I know.

488
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:04,059
We had five years.

489
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:07,463
Take a night to think it over.

490
00:24:07,497 --> 00:24:11,367
I'm going either way,
but I'd rather go with you.

491
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:13,936
Meet me here tomorrow night

492
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,437
and tell me your decision.

493
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:21,443
God fucking damn it.

494
00:24:21,478 --> 00:24:23,546
- What is it?
- Un-fucking-believable.

495
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,147
Lieutenant,
will there be any other...

496
00:24:25,181 --> 00:24:26,649
I don't know
who your sources are,

497
00:24:26,683 --> 00:24:28,551
but I can confirm
that Detective Morgan

498
00:24:28,585 --> 00:24:30,152
was in charge of the operation.

499
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:31,487
Holy shit.

500
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:33,055
She's blaming everything on me.

501
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:34,623
Is it true
that Detective Morgan

502
00:24:34,658 --> 00:24:36,225
has been placed
on disciplinary leave?

503
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:38,294
As of today, she's being placed

504
00:24:38,328 --> 00:24:40,329
on immediate suspension
with pay,

505
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:42,064
pending the results of...

506
00:24:42,098 --> 00:24:44,066
Whoa! Not the plasma.

507
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,434
Excuse me.

508
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:46,969
I thought we were
actually friends.

509
00:24:47,003 --> 00:24:49,905
Deb, wait.

510
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,840
I can't do it.

511
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,309
I can't let her throw me
under the bus

512
00:24:53,343 --> 00:24:54,710
and drive over me,

513
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:57,880
then back up a few fuckin' times
and drive off.

514
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:17,733
Fuck! Shit! Fuck!

515
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,335
Didn't you see me driving up?

516
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:20,736
Didn't you see me backing out?

517
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,837
You know, there's a reason

518
00:25:21,871 --> 00:25:25,174
why cars
have rearview mirrors, lady!

519
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:27,176
I mean, shit, look at that.

520
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,045
This here's fiberglass.
Can't pound that out.

521
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,714
I'm gonna have to pull
that whole quarter panel off.

522
00:25:31,748 --> 00:25:33,349
How do I know
it wasn't already there?

523
00:25:33,383 --> 00:25:35,451
You just hit my car.

524
00:25:35,485 --> 00:25:38,721
I was distracted.
Just let me give you some cash.

525
00:25:38,755 --> 00:25:40,956
No cash!
I don't want cash!

526
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:42,491
We'll do this
on the up-and-up,

527
00:25:42,525 --> 00:25:43,859
'cause that's the kind
of guy I am.

528
00:25:43,893 --> 00:25:46,562
We just let the insurance dudes
hash this out.

529
00:25:46,596 --> 00:25:48,230
You do have insurance,
don't you?

530
00:25:48,264 --> 00:25:51,834
- Yeah.
- Well, halle-fuckin'-lujah.

531
00:25:51,868 --> 00:25:53,802
Now, let's just, uh,
trade some info here

532
00:25:53,837 --> 00:25:56,505
and get this sorted out.

533
00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:01,043
Look, now, we can either
do this the right way,

534
00:26:01,077 --> 00:26:02,544
or I can call up the po-lice,

535
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:03,812
let Miami's finest handle it.

536
00:26:03,847 --> 00:26:04,847
- It's your call.
- No.

537
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:06,515
No, no, no. I...

538
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,193
The Jordan
Chase experience seminar

539
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:20,596
will resume tomorrow
at 8:00 A.M. sharp.

540
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,164
Vendors are open tonight
till 7:00 P.M.

541
00:26:22,198 --> 00:26:24,400
How was your day?

542
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:26,535
I guess working
for Jordan has its benefits.

543
00:26:29,072 --> 00:26:30,239
Hello?

544
00:26:30,273 --> 00:26:31,407
I'm here.

545
00:26:31,441 --> 00:26:32,808
I'm on my way.

546
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,677
No, I mean,
I'm here in the lobby.

547
00:26:42,085 --> 00:26:43,552
What are you doing here?

548
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:45,254
I got into a car accident.

549
00:26:45,288 --> 00:26:46,689
Are you okay?

550
00:26:46,723 --> 00:26:48,490
Yeah, yeah.

551
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:49,858
It was my fault.

552
00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:51,760
Actually, no,
it was Owen's fault.

553
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,396
Owen who?

554
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:58,233
My ex-fiance.

555
00:26:58,268 --> 00:26:59,368
He's in Miami.

556
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:03,639
Why?

557
00:27:03,673 --> 00:27:05,541
He came to see me.

558
00:27:05,575 --> 00:27:09,611
Don't worry, I didn't tell
him anything about anything.

559
00:27:09,646 --> 00:27:12,448
He asked me
to go away with him.

560
00:27:12,482 --> 00:27:17,720
Just up
and leave all this behind.

561
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,391
As if I could.

562
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:24,626
You could, you know.

563
00:27:28,264 --> 00:27:30,399
Do you want me to go?

564
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:32,334
If you want to...

565
00:27:32,368 --> 00:27:33,902
Go.

566
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:39,808
This is the only part
of my life

567
00:27:39,843 --> 00:27:41,376
that makes sense anymore.

568
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,513
What about Owen?

569
00:27:44,547 --> 00:27:45,514
He's leaving.

570
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:47,149
- When?
- Tomorrow.

571
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:51,787
Stay the night.

572
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:54,790
The seminar's out for the day,

573
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:56,492
and Cole could be anywhere.
He could see you.

574
00:27:56,526 --> 00:27:58,761
It's too risky to have you
walk through the lobby again.

575
00:27:58,795 --> 00:28:02,631
If I stay,

576
00:28:02,665 --> 00:28:04,967
does that mean you're
not gonna kill Cole tonight?

577
00:28:05,001 --> 00:28:07,102
No, it's still happening.

578
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:15,110
We're gonna prepare
the room together.

579
00:28:39,502 --> 00:28:41,670
This is all much easier
with a partner.

580
00:28:51,014 --> 00:28:52,648
But a partner in what?

581
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,686
Why didn't you tell me?

582
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,121
I was planning to.

583
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,290
I have no idea how the press
got hold of it.

584
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:03,625
Maybe it was because
you fucking leaked it.

585
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,327
You'll be a desk jockey
for a few weeks,

586
00:29:05,361 --> 00:29:07,596
then your union rep
will have you reinstated.

587
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,165
This time next year,
all will have blown over.

588
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,034
It's just your word
against mine

589
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:13,402
and everybody else
that was there.

590
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:14,803
Some people don't agree

591
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:17,172
with your version
of the events.

592
00:29:17,207 --> 00:29:19,508
Who'd you get to lie for you?

593
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:21,276
Batista?

594
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:23,445
Batista's gonna back
your fuckin' story?

595
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:25,047
Do I have to go
to Matthews with this?

596
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:27,850
You watch yourself, detective.

597
00:29:27,884 --> 00:29:30,519
We wouldn't want your
reinstatement to be delayed.

598
00:29:31,554 --> 00:29:32,721
God.

599
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:38,193
I was fucking happy
for you when you got married.

600
00:29:38,228 --> 00:29:40,229
I actually thought that you
being with Batista

601
00:29:40,263 --> 00:29:41,396
might make you a nicer person.

602
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,101
I never expected you
to fuckin' eat him alive.

603
00:30:09,325 --> 00:30:11,460
Cole's other victims.

604
00:30:11,494 --> 00:30:13,795
Why did you put
their pictures up?

605
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,364
Cole needs to see
what he's done.

606
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,934
What do you get
out of all this?

607
00:30:18,968 --> 00:30:22,504
I like knowing that the men
who did this to you

608
00:30:22,538 --> 00:30:24,206
won't do it to anyone else.

609
00:30:26,643 --> 00:30:28,076
This isn't about me.

610
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:32,948
You're standing here.

611
00:30:32,982 --> 00:30:35,317
Look at all this.

612
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:38,487
If you didn't know me,
you'd still be in this room.

613
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,791
Boyd wasn't your first.

614
00:30:45,662 --> 00:30:47,629
You've been doing this
a long time.

615
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:54,603
It's Cole.

616
00:30:56,572 --> 00:30:58,473
We'll wait for him
to go to sleep,

617
00:30:58,508 --> 00:31:00,876
then you take off
and I grab him.

618
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,344
What's that?

619
00:31:02,378 --> 00:31:05,714
M-99. Animal tranquilizer.

620
00:31:05,748 --> 00:31:08,884
Gives me a few hours
to wrap his body in plastic

621
00:31:08,918 --> 00:31:10,519
and secure him to this desk.

622
00:31:10,553 --> 00:31:13,522
You're gonna kill him
while he's still out?

623
00:31:13,556 --> 00:31:14,890
No, I'm gonna wake him up,

624
00:31:14,924 --> 00:31:16,458
see if he'll give up
the other two names

625
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:18,694
of the men in the pictures.

626
00:31:18,728 --> 00:31:20,462
My knife can be
very persuasive.

627
00:31:21,864 --> 00:31:23,532
Stay here.

628
00:31:32,842 --> 00:31:34,476
Oww!

629
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,478
Tie my other arm!

630
00:31:36,512 --> 00:31:38,981
Do it now!

631
00:31:39,015 --> 00:31:40,849
Unh! Yes!

632
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:42,851
Ohh! Ohh!

633
00:31:42,885 --> 00:31:45,053
Ohh!

634
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:46,621
Yes!

635
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:50,359
Oh, God! Oh!

636
00:31:59,402 --> 00:32:02,004
No.

637
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:03,872
No!

638
00:32:07,043 --> 00:32:08,643
No!

639
00:32:11,914 --> 00:32:13,548
No more! Please!

640
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,951
No!

641
00:32:15,985 --> 00:32:17,285
No! No!

642
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,654
No! No!

643
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:21,423
No! Let me go!

644
00:32:21,457 --> 00:32:23,825
No! Let me out of here!

645
00:32:47,784 --> 00:32:48,817
What happened?

646
00:32:48,851 --> 00:32:50,218
You fell asleep.

647
00:32:50,253 --> 00:32:52,554
What about Cole?

648
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:56,591
He's back
at the seminar by now.

649
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:58,994
The screamer spent the night.

650
00:32:59,028 --> 00:33:00,495
So you're not gonna kill him?

651
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,330
No, I am.

652
00:33:02,365 --> 00:33:04,766
I've been thinking
about it all night.

653
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:07,102
Cole makes his security rounds
at every session.

654
00:33:07,136 --> 00:33:08,770
So...

655
00:33:08,805 --> 00:33:10,739
I'll wait for him
by the service elevator

656
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:13,408
and M-99 him there.

657
00:33:13,443 --> 00:33:14,943
I would have rather
grabbed him at night,

658
00:33:14,977 --> 00:33:16,078
but I can make this work.

659
00:33:16,112 --> 00:33:17,279
And what about me?

660
00:33:17,313 --> 00:33:19,948
You'll wait
until the session starts.

661
00:33:19,982 --> 00:33:21,516
Everyone will be
in the seminar.

662
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:23,118
You won't be spotted
when you leave.

663
00:33:23,152 --> 00:33:25,720
Just steer clear
of the service elevator.

664
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:27,889
Okay.

665
00:33:29,826 --> 00:33:31,593
- I can't believe it.
- What?

666
00:33:31,627 --> 00:33:34,763
I actually slept.

667
00:33:46,476 --> 00:33:47,843
Hey.

668
00:33:47,877 --> 00:33:49,811
- Do you want to get up?
- No.

669
00:33:49,846 --> 00:33:51,179
Do you want to go
back to sleep?

670
00:33:51,214 --> 00:33:52,414
No.

671
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:53,648
Do you want to just...

672
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:55,217
No, I just... I don't
want to do anything.

673
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:56,618
I just want to lie here.

674
00:33:56,652 --> 00:33:58,120
It's Sunday.
I'm allowed.

675
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:03,625
Laguerta's an evil bitch.

676
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:05,293
No, she's not.

677
00:34:09,031 --> 00:34:11,600
Maybe she is.

678
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:14,870
The best way to get back at her

679
00:34:14,904 --> 00:34:16,705
is to do exactly what she says.

680
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,540
Go on leave,
talk to your union rep,

681
00:34:18,574 --> 00:34:20,108
get reinstated,

682
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:24,112
then come back and kick
as much ass as you possibly can.

683
00:34:26,883 --> 00:34:30,185
No one, not even Laguerta,

684
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:31,920
can deny that you're
a great detective.

685
00:34:31,954 --> 00:34:33,655
At the end of the day,

686
00:34:33,689 --> 00:34:34,689
you'll be
the one left standing.

687
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:35,957
At then end of the day?

688
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:38,093
Yeah, you know,
when all is said and done.

689
00:34:48,905 --> 00:34:50,872
Sounds like one very long day.

690
00:34:55,912 --> 00:34:56,978
Hey.

691
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:58,513
I smell coffee.

692
00:34:58,548 --> 00:34:59,514
Now's not a good time.

693
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:00,982
Well, it is for me.

694
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:04,352
Hey, Debra Morgan.

695
00:35:04,387 --> 00:35:06,922
- Liddy, right?
- Good memory.

696
00:35:06,956 --> 00:35:07,923
I like this one.

697
00:35:07,957 --> 00:35:09,925
"This one"?

698
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:11,426
You and I got
something in common.

699
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,161
We've both been fucked over
by Laguerta.

700
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:14,196
Well, maybe we should make

701
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,330
matching T-shirts
or something.

702
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:17,933
Okay.
Well, this one's going

703
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:19,834
for a fuckin'
breakfast burrito.

704
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:21,836
I'll see you two later.

705
00:35:25,074 --> 00:35:27,108
Call before you come over.

706
00:35:27,143 --> 00:35:28,210
It's a common courtesy.

707
00:35:28,244 --> 00:35:29,578
Don't you want to know
about this girl

708
00:35:29,612 --> 00:35:30,912
shacked up with Dexter Morgan?

709
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:33,748
I just staged a little
meet and greet with her.

710
00:35:33,783 --> 00:35:35,250
Old P.I. move.

711
00:35:35,284 --> 00:35:36,284
So you met her.

712
00:35:36,319 --> 00:35:38,420
Name, Lumen Pierce.

713
00:35:38,454 --> 00:35:40,956
Lumen... stupid fuckin' name.

714
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,624
From Minneapolis, Minnesota.

715
00:35:42,658 --> 00:35:44,492
Supposed to be married
three months ago,

716
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:45,694
picture in the paper
and everything.

717
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:46,995
Just takes off.

718
00:35:47,029 --> 00:35:48,496
Shows up here in Miami

719
00:35:48,531 --> 00:35:53,034
one week before your boy's wife,
Rita Morgan, is murdered.

720
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,169
Now, what you think of that?

721
00:35:54,203 --> 00:35:56,338
I don't know.
Is that all you got?

722
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:57,939
It's a hell of lot more
than I had yesterday.

723
00:35:57,974 --> 00:35:59,808
Well, stay on it.

724
00:35:59,842 --> 00:36:02,110
I'd love to,
but I am running out of loot.

725
00:36:02,144 --> 00:36:03,178
I just paid you last week.

726
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:04,713
And I just fucked up my car

727
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:06,381
getting this info
for you Quinn.

728
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:07,782
Now, this boy is dirty.

729
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:09,084
What you gonna do about it?

730
00:36:09,118 --> 00:36:10,752
I'm not giving you any more.

731
00:36:10,786 --> 00:36:12,954
You know, I thought you and me
had an understanding.

732
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:14,723
I mean, it'd be a shame

733
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:17,359
if the skirt you're bonin'
finds out about all this.

734
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:20,195
And how would that happen?

735
00:36:21,664 --> 00:36:22,631
I don't know.

736
00:36:22,665 --> 00:36:24,466
Things go wrong every day.

737
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,401
Fuckin' motherfucker!

738
00:36:27,903 --> 00:36:31,072
You two are startin'
to sound more alike every day.

739
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:32,574
Must be love.

740
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:37,646
Tragedy.

741
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,447
Many of us here
have experienced it

742
00:36:39,482 --> 00:36:40,749
in one form or another.

743
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:42,384
The kind that leaves
you wondering

744
00:36:42,418 --> 00:36:43,618
if there's a reason
to go on living.

745
00:36:43,653 --> 00:36:44,953
For the last two days,

746
00:36:44,987 --> 00:36:46,621
you've heard me talking
about getting in touch

747
00:36:46,656 --> 00:36:48,123
with your primal self.

748
00:36:48,157 --> 00:36:52,327
But how does the primal self
deal with loss?

749
00:36:52,361 --> 00:36:53,895
Cole's starting his rounds.

750
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:55,930
He'll reach the service elevator
in five minutes.

751
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:57,565
In three minutes, so will I.

752
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,067
There's someone in this room

753
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:01,002
who is dealing
with that very question.

754
00:37:01,037 --> 00:37:05,106
Dexter Morgan.

755
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:07,175
Come and join me
on stage, Dexter.

756
00:37:07,209 --> 00:37:09,077
I know you weren't
expecting this,

757
00:37:09,111 --> 00:37:10,979
but it's important.

758
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:12,414
Please.

759
00:37:12,448 --> 00:37:14,649
So much
for slipping out quietly.

760
00:37:14,684 --> 00:37:15,850
- Dexter!
- Dexter.

761
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:17,585
They want you, Dexter.

762
00:37:19,388 --> 00:37:20,989
Dexter. Dexter.

763
00:37:21,023 --> 00:37:22,824
Dexter.

764
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:24,359
Dexter.

765
00:37:24,393 --> 00:37:26,127
Dexter.

766
00:37:46,048 --> 00:37:49,050
Dexter works
with Miami Metro Homicide.

767
00:37:49,085 --> 00:37:51,886
Recently, he lost his wife.

768
00:37:51,921 --> 00:37:53,621
She was murdered...

769
00:37:55,091 --> 00:37:56,624
By the Trinity killer.

770
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:02,197
The very person that Dexter's
department was hunting.

771
00:38:02,231 --> 00:38:03,965
You were the one
to find her, your wife?

772
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:04,966
Rita?

773
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:08,002
Yeah.

774
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:09,204
Yes.

775
00:38:09,238 --> 00:38:11,039
I'm gonna ask you
to do something, Dexter,

776
00:38:11,073 --> 00:38:12,407
and it's gonna be
very difficult.

777
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:14,542
I want you to relive
that moment.

778
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:17,946
According to the newspapers,

779
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,849
you were supposed to be
going away on honeymoon?

780
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:24,953
Dexter.

781
00:38:26,522 --> 00:38:27,822
Ye... yes.

782
00:38:27,857 --> 00:38:29,491
Tell us about it.

783
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:34,129
Well, we postponed
the honeymoon

784
00:38:34,163 --> 00:38:36,765
because we had
a new baby, a boy.

785
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:38,733
Keep going.

786
00:38:38,768 --> 00:38:40,535
Tell me how you found her.

787
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:42,837
Please.

788
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:49,844
I'd come home after work.

789
00:38:49,879 --> 00:38:54,282
I remember
walking through the house.

790
00:38:54,316 --> 00:38:56,217
I turned the corner and...

791
00:38:59,555 --> 00:39:04,025
It's like time
actually slowed down

792
00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:05,994
and then stopped.

793
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,665
It's just a series of pictures.

794
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:13,401
What'd you see?

795
00:39:13,436 --> 00:39:16,971
I saw my son sitting in blood.

796
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:20,742
He was crying.

797
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:26,381
So much blood.

798
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:31,853
And she was there in the tub.

799
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:33,421
She'd bled out.

800
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:34,889
Her eyes were still open.

801
00:39:34,924 --> 00:39:36,524
I want you to tell me
something, Dexter.

802
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:38,359
I want you to be very honest.

803
00:39:38,394 --> 00:39:42,030
What did you feel
in that moment?

804
00:39:42,064 --> 00:39:43,932
We want to know.

805
00:39:48,404 --> 00:39:50,972
It's difficult
to put into words.

806
00:39:51,006 --> 00:39:52,841
Everything...

807
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:55,710
Fell apart. I felt...

808
00:39:55,744 --> 00:39:58,046
Shattered?

809
00:40:00,282 --> 00:40:01,449
Yes.

810
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:03,151
When the primal self
is shattered,

811
00:40:03,185 --> 00:40:05,954
it reaches out in search of
what will make it whole again.

812
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:08,957
Do you feel that, Dexter?

813
00:40:08,991 --> 00:40:11,426
That hunger inside you
to be whole again?

814
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,460
I do.

815
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:15,396
That hunger
is your primal self.

816
00:40:15,431 --> 00:40:17,232
You must open your heart
and listen

817
00:40:17,266 --> 00:40:18,566
to what it's saying.

818
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:20,435
Many people
after suffering a tragedy...

819
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:21,703
Mr. Harmon?

820
00:40:21,737 --> 00:40:23,905
Spend the rest of their lives
as broken beings...

821
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:25,139
Can you sign this, please?

822
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:26,474
Living in the past.

823
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:30,345
Your primal self
is crying out to be whole.

824
00:40:30,379 --> 00:40:33,147
What is it
that will make you whole?

825
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:34,549
For some, it's a new job.

826
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:36,918
For others, the love
of another person.

827
00:40:36,952 --> 00:40:39,454
Your primal self will tell you,

828
00:40:39,488 --> 00:40:41,422
but you have to be open
to hearing the message.

829
00:40:41,457 --> 00:40:42,457
Are you?

830
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:43,758
Yes.

831
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:46,227
Then you've just taken
your first step

832
00:40:46,262 --> 00:40:47,962
toward happiness.

833
00:40:59,174 --> 00:41:01,276
Dexter.

834
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:53,995
Aah!

835
00:41:59,268 --> 00:42:00,268
Aah!

836
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:05,206
You fuckin' bitch!

837
00:42:14,249 --> 00:42:15,717
Not this time.

838
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:34,168
I'm gonna take this gag
out of your mouth,

839
00:42:34,203 --> 00:42:35,837
but if you make one sound
I don't like,

840
00:42:35,871 --> 00:42:37,372
I'm gonna cut your eyes out.

841
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,743
Blink so I know you understand.

842
00:42:46,782 --> 00:42:49,083
We know about Boyd

843
00:42:49,118 --> 00:42:51,119
and Dan the dentist.

844
00:42:51,153 --> 00:42:53,921
And now you.

845
00:42:53,956 --> 00:42:55,156
Who are the others?

846
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:59,460
The guy who held
a watch up to my ear.

847
00:42:59,495 --> 00:43:02,230
"Tick tick tick.

848
00:43:02,264 --> 00:43:05,433
That's the sound
of your life running out."

849
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:06,768
What are there names?

850
00:43:10,305 --> 00:43:11,739
What did he say?

851
00:43:15,611 --> 00:43:16,744
Huey,

852
00:43:16,779 --> 00:43:18,079
Dewey,

853
00:43:18,113 --> 00:43:19,580
and Louie.

854
00:43:21,617 --> 00:43:24,452
Look at the women
whose lives you destroyed.

855
00:43:24,486 --> 00:43:26,688
Look.

856
00:43:33,729 --> 00:43:36,664
Death was the only kindness
you showed them.

857
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,321
It's a shame
you can only die once.

858
00:44:31,019 --> 00:44:33,654
You said I'd done this before.
That's true.

859
00:44:35,758 --> 00:44:37,325
This is who I am.

860
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,567
When I was a child,
my mother was murdered

861
00:44:46,602 --> 00:44:48,402
in front of me, and it...

862
00:44:51,473 --> 00:44:54,175
Shattered me.

863
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:59,046
I've done this ever since.

864
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,684
Because for the longest time,

865
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:05,486
it was the only way
I could feel...

866
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,691
Unbroken.

867
00:45:13,095 --> 00:45:17,632
And then, Rita was killed and

868
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:19,367
none of this
made sense anymore.

869
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:29,210
Until now.

870
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:41,722
Miguel couldn't.

871
00:45:41,757 --> 00:45:43,090
My father couldn't.

872
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:47,094
Can anyone live with the truth
of what I am?

873
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:06,647
Is Lumen
what will make me whole?

874
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:21,562
Moving in?

875
00:46:22,898 --> 00:46:24,999
The lieutenant said
I should bring some of my stuff

876
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:26,267
into this department.

877
00:46:26,301 --> 00:46:29,804
It was you.

878
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:31,672
Laguerta asked you
to back her story,

879
00:46:31,707 --> 00:46:33,241
and of course you did.

880
00:46:35,811 --> 00:46:36,811
Deb.

881
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,480
"Deb"?

882
00:46:39,514 --> 00:46:42,350
Detective Morgan,

883
00:46:42,384 --> 00:46:45,720
you're the youngest woman
in Miami Metro

884
00:46:45,754 --> 00:46:46,821
to ever make detective,

885
00:46:46,855 --> 00:46:49,957
and I really admire you,
like, a lot.

886
00:46:49,992 --> 00:46:52,960
And I came here hoping
to learn from you.

887
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:58,833
What you did

888
00:46:58,867 --> 00:47:00,501
you would never learn from me.

889
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:04,538
Good luck.

890
00:47:04,573 --> 00:47:06,440
You're gonna need it.

891
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:25,660
Deb.

892
00:47:25,694 --> 00:47:27,762
I'm gonna do whatever it takes

893
00:47:27,796 --> 00:47:30,932
to set the record straight.

894
00:47:30,966 --> 00:47:32,733
I thought you were
backing Laguerta's story.

895
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:35,836
No, I didn't know
what I was gonna do.

896
00:47:35,871 --> 00:47:39,040
I was stuck
between a rock and my wife,

897
00:47:39,074 --> 00:47:42,310
but I decided I'm backing you.

898
00:47:42,344 --> 00:47:44,412
Might not go over
too well at home.

899
00:47:44,446 --> 00:47:47,214
Hey, you're
flesh and blood to me,

900
00:47:47,249 --> 00:47:49,517
like my kid sister,

901
00:47:49,551 --> 00:47:52,687
but better because
I actually like you.

902
00:47:55,157 --> 00:47:56,891
Damn.

903
00:47:56,925 --> 00:47:58,159
It's okay.

904
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:02,396
Yeah.

905
00:48:02,431 --> 00:48:03,831
It's okay.

906
00:48:20,716 --> 00:48:22,950
Most people wait
until the seminar is over

907
00:48:22,985 --> 00:48:24,151
before checking out.

908
00:48:24,186 --> 00:48:26,320
Uh, I lose my nanny in an hour.

909
00:48:26,355 --> 00:48:28,689
I gotta get back to my son.

910
00:48:28,724 --> 00:48:30,257
Is everything okay?

911
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:31,492
It's nothing important.

912
00:48:31,526 --> 00:48:33,761
Just a little security glitch.

913
00:48:33,795 --> 00:48:35,262
Mm.

914
00:48:35,297 --> 00:48:36,764
Like your chief
of security's head

915
00:48:36,798 --> 00:48:38,132
is in my luggage?

916
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,067
I want to thank you
for coming onstage.

917
00:48:40,102 --> 00:48:42,303
It didn't seem
like I had any choice.

918
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:43,504
I know it was sudden,

919
00:48:43,538 --> 00:48:44,939
and you probably
didn't appreciate it,

920
00:48:44,973 --> 00:48:46,040
but you'll look back on it,

921
00:48:46,074 --> 00:48:47,441
you'll realize it was worth it.

922
00:48:47,476 --> 00:48:51,746
Don't forget what happened
here this weekend, Dexter.

923
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,780
I won't.

924
00:48:52,814 --> 00:48:54,448
Act on what you've learned.

925
00:48:54,483 --> 00:48:56,117
Don't let it slip away.

926
00:48:56,151 --> 00:48:57,885
It's what I tell my clients.

927
00:48:57,919 --> 00:48:59,153
Tick tick tick?

928
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:01,555
That's the sound
of your life running out.

929
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:04,091
My primal instincts were right.

930
00:49:04,126 --> 00:49:05,459
Jordan's one of them.

931
00:49:08,663 --> 00:49:10,064
Take it, Dexter.

932
00:49:10,098 --> 00:49:11,766
Oh, I will.

933
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,847
It's a law of physics

934
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:30,117
that elements want to unify.

935
00:49:43,965 --> 00:49:45,733
Single cells in a petri dish

936
00:49:45,767 --> 00:49:49,136
thrash around
until they coalesce.

937
00:49:57,946 --> 00:50:00,915
And events in the universe
that once seemed random

938
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:04,218
are eventually revealed to have
an underlying connectedness.

939
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:07,388
Jordan Chase is one of them
I'm sure of it.

940
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:09,557
"Tick tick tick."

941
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:12,493
But he wasn't in the photo.

942
00:50:12,527 --> 00:50:14,829
Maybe he took the photo,
I don't know.

943
00:50:16,565 --> 00:50:19,033
We're gonna take down
Jordan Chase?

944
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,040
First things first.

945
00:50:33,215 --> 00:50:36,016
Just...Let go?

946
00:50:55,003 --> 00:50:56,237
Just let go.

947
00:51:15,957 --> 00:51:25,893
