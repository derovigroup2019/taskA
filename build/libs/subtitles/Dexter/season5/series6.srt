2
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:47,435
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:48,737 --> 00:01:50,204
Cut him, and I'll blow
your fucking head off.

4
00:01:50,238 --> 00:01:51,439
Ah!

5
00:01:51,473 --> 00:01:53,340
Medic!
I need a fucking medic!

6
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,009
We were wondering
if there's anything

7
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:58,045
you can tell us
about the man who injured you.

8
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,314
I know where Carlos and his
brother have been hanging out...

9
00:02:00,348 --> 00:02:02,083
At a local club
called the Mayan.

10
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:03,884
You got your lead.
Congrats.

11
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:05,586
Yeah, we stake this place out,
they show up,

12
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,054
and then we take
these Santa Muerta no-dicks

13
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:08,322
down for good.

14
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:10,357
- Are you and Quinn...
- We're fuck buddies.

15
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:13,227
Don't bring him around
when Harrison's here.

16
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:15,196
Would you like some coffee?

17
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,099
That would be wonderful.
Thank you so much.

18
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:19,266
Son of a bitch.

19
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:21,001
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!
Sergeant!

20
00:02:21,036 --> 00:02:23,838
Angel, let him go.
This is a sting!

21
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,539
I.A. needed my help

22
00:02:25,574 --> 00:02:27,575
to bust a narcotics cop
on the take,

23
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:29,410
and I said yes,
to close the books

24
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:31,145
on your bar fight!

25
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:33,347
Fuck those I.A. rats.

26
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:34,982
And your boss.

27
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:37,384
That bitch put handcuffs on me.

28
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:38,619
I might have a job for you.

29
00:02:38,653 --> 00:02:40,955
You got a name?

30
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:42,523
Dexter Morgan.

31
00:02:42,557 --> 00:02:46,293
Boyd wasn't the only one
who did this to me.

32
00:02:46,328 --> 00:02:48,629
There were others.

33
00:02:48,663 --> 00:02:50,631
What are you gonna do if you
actually find one of these guys?

34
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:53,367
- What you won't.
- You gonna kill him?

35
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:57,204
You don't get to tell me
what to do.

36
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,572
What are you doing?

37
00:02:58,607 --> 00:03:01,308
You were about to murder
the wrong man.

38
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:04,145
Go home.

39
00:03:04,179 --> 00:03:06,413
Okay.
Okay, okay, I'll go.

40
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:07,748
You're doing the right thing.

41
00:03:07,783 --> 00:03:09,784
Your parents will be happy
to see you.

42
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:12,386
Thank you.

43
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,257
Maybe this is one problem
I can check off the list.

44
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:22,763
Welcome to Miami.

45
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:40,280
I've always tried to keep

46
00:03:40,315 --> 00:03:43,016
the different parts
of my life separate.

47
00:03:47,388 --> 00:03:51,158
Becoming a father made that
much more difficult.

48
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:54,094
And as a husband, I failed.

49
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:57,598
But I'm a very neat monster...

50
00:03:57,632 --> 00:04:00,634
Who won't make
the same mistake again.

51
00:04:04,973 --> 00:04:07,407
I packed up
Rita's wedding dress.

52
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:10,410
I thought Astor
might want it someday.

53
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:19,353
Feels like it took you guys
months to move in...

54
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:21,321
Only a day to pack up.

55
00:04:21,356 --> 00:04:23,357
The realtor suggested
we paint the walls white.

56
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:26,193
She wants to stage the house
Miami chic.

57
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:28,262
No evidence that a family
ever lived here.

58
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:30,697
Or died here.

59
00:04:30,732 --> 00:04:32,199
You have to disclose that,
don't you?

60
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:34,835
The hope is that
a ridiculously low listing price

61
00:04:34,869 --> 00:04:37,471
will help a buyer
see past that.

62
00:04:37,505 --> 00:04:41,375
Any idea
where you want to live?

63
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:43,644
I'm sorry.
That was a stupid question.

64
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:45,379
You... you should take
the apartment.

65
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:48,782
- No. No, that's yours.
- No. I insist.

66
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:50,484
It's really always been yours.

67
00:04:50,518 --> 00:04:52,319
I'll move out.

68
00:04:52,353 --> 00:04:54,821
I thought you already did.

69
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:58,258
I didn't move in with Quinn.

70
00:04:58,293 --> 00:04:59,793
Well, you're never around.

71
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:03,597
I'm at Quinn's,
but I don't live there...

72
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:05,699
No clothes in any drawers.

73
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:08,902
There's no
his-and-hers-toothbrush action.

74
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:12,806
Quinn's place is all Quinn.

75
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,809
A vast, empty space?

76
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:23,150
I don't remember Rita in these.

77
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:25,719
Because they belong to Lumen.

78
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:29,890
Me either.

79
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:32,092
Lumen is home in Minneapolis...

80
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:35,062
Another part of my life
packed away.

81
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,935
Life seems different now...

82
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:44,471
Manageable.

83
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:50,644
Everything in its right place.

84
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:31,385
Soon, Lance Robinson
will be on my table.

85
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:34,221
Lance trolls the Internet,

86
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:38,859
engaging in casual encounters
with innocent men...

87
00:06:38,893 --> 00:06:40,927
Who never suspect
those encounters

88
00:06:40,962 --> 00:06:43,397
could turn deadly.

89
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:49,603
Four times
Lance deliberately pushed

90
00:06:49,637 --> 00:06:53,740
someone's fantasies too far.

91
00:06:53,775 --> 00:06:57,644
He will be an easy kill,
just like old times.

92
00:06:57,678 --> 00:07:00,814
Tonight's the night.

93
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:27,574
Okay, people,

94
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:29,443
let's go over our positions
at club Mayan.

95
00:07:29,477 --> 00:07:31,411
Everybody be in place
by 10:00.

96
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:33,246
Batista and I'll be
in the van, as usual.

97
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:34,681
Quinn, you'll watch the door.

98
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:37,350
Cira...

99
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:39,286
Yes, chief?

100
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,421
Don't let me stop you.

101
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:43,223
Officer Manzon,
you'll be on the floor

102
00:07:43,257 --> 00:07:45,158
watching foot traffic
at the v.I.P. room,

103
00:07:45,193 --> 00:07:47,527
in case the Fuentes brothers
roll through.

104
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:48,929
And what if they don't?

105
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:52,165
Then we'll work
the operation until they do.

106
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,801
You were face-to-face
with Carlos Fuentes, right?

107
00:07:54,836 --> 00:07:56,169
Yes, sir.

108
00:07:56,204 --> 00:07:57,737
Well, then that means
he knows that we're onto him.

109
00:07:57,772 --> 00:08:00,140
Tell me why they would ever
return to this club.

110
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:02,476
The only reason
the Fuentes brothers

111
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,977
are forcing people
to withdraw cash from the atm

112
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:06,813
is to pay for table service
at this club.

113
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:09,449
We ran the dates
of the ATM holdups

114
00:08:09,484 --> 00:08:11,084
past the club managers.

115
00:08:11,118 --> 00:08:13,353
And they confirmed
that in each of those nights,

116
00:08:13,387 --> 00:08:15,655
the Fuentes brothers
showed up at club Mayan

117
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,324
and took over
the V.I.P. lounge.

118
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:20,060
So if the Fuentes brothers
do show up at this club,

119
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:22,229
which is highly unlikely,
it means that someone

120
00:08:22,263 --> 00:08:24,297
is possibly lying on the floor
of their living room

121
00:08:24,332 --> 00:08:27,167
without their head.

122
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:28,835
We're working
the only lead we have.

123
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,737
All you're doing
is drinking and dancing

124
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:34,007
on the taxpayer's dime.

125
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,343
I would have expected
more from you, Morgan.

126
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:50,156
Chief...

127
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:51,892
We don't have
a lot of options here.

128
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:53,126
Without this operation,

129
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,562
we're effectively stopping work
on this case,

130
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:57,197
which we cannot do
to this community.

131
00:08:57,231 --> 00:08:59,499
Did you even know
this operation was happening?

132
00:08:59,534 --> 00:09:01,301
Of course I knew.
Why wouldn't I?

133
00:09:01,335 --> 00:09:02,969
Well, it seems
you've been spending

134
00:09:03,004 --> 00:09:05,105
an awful lot of time lately
with internal affairs

135
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:07,641
bailing your new husband
out of hot water.

136
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:10,644
Bravo, Mrs. Batista.

137
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:12,779
I'm keeping my name.

138
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:14,014
And I think working club Mayan

139
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:16,149
is a valid allocation
of my squad's resources.

140
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:18,184
It is your squad, lieutenant.

141
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:20,787
- How you manage it is up to you.
- Thank you.

142
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:22,255
But if another murder
goes up on the board,

143
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,258
it's your ass on the line,
not mine.

144
00:09:31,032 --> 00:09:32,866
You have one more night
at club Mayan.

145
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,968
Make something happen.

146
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:37,003
Matthews doesn't have
much faith in us, does he?

147
00:09:37,038 --> 00:09:39,673
Yeah, well, that fight you had
at the bar didn't help anything.

148
00:09:39,707 --> 00:09:42,509
- He knows about the bar fight?
- Of course he knows.

149
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:44,377
A narcotics officer
got suspended

150
00:09:44,412 --> 00:09:45,545
because of that bar fight.

151
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,048
No. A narcotics officer
got suspended

152
00:09:48,082 --> 00:09:49,549
because of you.

153
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:51,551
- Me?
- You ran to I.A.D.

154
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:53,420
You cooked up the sting.

155
00:09:53,454 --> 00:09:55,655
You basically
got Stan Liddy fired.

156
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,991
And got all the charges
against you dropped.

157
00:09:58,025 --> 00:09:59,392
I didn't ask for any of that.

158
00:09:59,427 --> 00:10:01,895
I could have handled whatever
I.A.D. had coming my way.

159
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:03,229
Oh, so anything
that happens is fine?

160
00:10:03,264 --> 00:10:04,931
When it happens to me, yes.

161
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:06,333
I can take care of myself.

162
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:07,534
But now that we're married,

163
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:09,069
whatever happens to me
happens to you.

164
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:10,637
That's right.
That's exactly right.

165
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:12,806
- We're married.
- Here's what's bothering me.

166
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,240
You weren't looking out for me

167
00:10:14,275 --> 00:10:15,642
out of some sense
of compassion.

168
00:10:15,676 --> 00:10:17,911
You were taking care
of yourself.

169
00:10:17,945 --> 00:10:20,680
God forbid your name should lose
some of its shine.

170
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:25,952
- Get out of my office.
- Mm-hmm.

171
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:52,278
Hey.

172
00:10:52,313 --> 00:10:54,247
I thought you might want
a debriefing

173
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:56,182
before we hit club Mayan.

174
00:10:56,217 --> 00:11:00,687
Um, sort of not a good time.

175
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:03,189
Where's Quinn, and what have
you done with him?

176
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:05,659
I know, I know.
Um...

177
00:11:05,693 --> 00:11:08,328
Just give me an hour.

178
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:11,297
- An hour?
- Yeah.

179
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:12,866
Who's naked in your apartment?

180
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,802
Uh, no one is naked.

181
00:11:15,836 --> 00:11:17,237
Then what?

182
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:20,407
- I'm such a fucking idiot.
- Debra, wait.

183
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:23,176
Come here.
Debra, come here.

184
00:11:25,846 --> 00:11:28,581
Debra Morgan.
This is Stan Liddy.

185
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:31,584
Liddy had a run-in
with I.A.D.

186
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:33,286
and, uh, got suspended.

187
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,722
We're prepping him

188
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:37,590
for his union-rep meeting
tomorrow.

189
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,792
Sorry.

190
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:41,628
All clothes are staying on.

191
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:44,297
- I'll just...
- Uh, meet me there?

192
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:46,599
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

193
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:53,239
You are boning
our target's sister?

194
00:11:53,274 --> 00:11:57,043
Just tell me what you
found out on Dexter Morgan.

195
00:11:57,078 --> 00:11:59,813
Well...

196
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:02,148
Your boy's squeaky clean
on paper.

197
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:04,684
He's only been out
of the country once, to Paris.

198
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:08,488
Pays his bills on time,
keeps to himself.

199
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:10,323
I'll tell you,
it's all too neat

200
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:11,758
and a little too phony.

201
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:13,159
You see drug dealers

202
00:12:13,194 --> 00:12:15,562
with the very same profiles
all the time.

203
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,997
Oh, that's exactly
what I'm thinking.

204
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:20,734
I mean, what's he hiding?

205
00:12:20,768 --> 00:12:22,335
Peekaboo.

206
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:29,609
Bye-bye, daddy.
Peekaboo!

207
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,680
Oh, thank you.

208
00:12:33,714 --> 00:12:36,316
You're really very good
with him.

209
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,518
I wish I didn't have
to work tonight.

210
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:41,154
The lab fell so far behind
while I was out.

211
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:43,523
Night's the only time I can ever
get anything done.

212
00:12:43,557 --> 00:12:46,793
Well, I hope the lieutenant
appreciates your dedication.

213
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:49,295
I'm pretty sure she does.

214
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,232
Although tonight
will be dedicated to Lance.

215
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:56,669
So you think
about midnight, then?

216
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:59,305
I'll try to make it sooner.

217
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,040
Can you say
"bye-bye, daddy"?

218
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:04,277
Die-die.

219
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:05,345
Did you hear that?

220
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:07,247
He said, "die-die."

221
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:10,383
Don't be silly.
He said, "bye-bye."

222
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:12,786
Harrison's first word.

223
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,787
There's your good boy.

224
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:16,956
I hope so.

225
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:19,225
Die-die.

226
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,328
From the mouth of babes.

227
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:30,003
I rented an RV,
placed an ad online,

228
00:13:30,037 --> 00:13:32,472
saying I was cruising
down to the keys,

229
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:39,012
and just like that...
My victim came to me.

230
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:42,415
You must be ten inches
of pure steel, hmm?

231
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:44,317
You betcha.

232
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:46,986
Oh...

233
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:56,029
Compartmentalization began
as an architectural theory...

234
00:13:56,063 --> 00:13:58,164
Divide buildings into sections

235
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:01,267
which can be closed off to
prevent a fire from spreading.

236
00:14:01,302 --> 00:14:06,206
Life can also be divided
into closed-off sections.

237
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,208
Makes everything much simpler.

238
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:17,150
Lumen Pierce.

239
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:27,160
Again?

240
00:14:31,832 --> 00:14:35,602
This is the life
Harry wanted for me...

241
00:14:35,636 --> 00:14:38,071
Carefully divided.

242
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:41,274
Shh...

243
00:14:49,617 --> 00:14:52,719
What the hell?

244
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:57,957
Dexter, I...

245
00:14:57,992 --> 00:15:00,927
I shot one of them.

246
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:02,562
I killed him.

247
00:15:02,596 --> 00:15:07,433
I'm at the marina...
Bayshore Biscayne or something?

248
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:08,801
You're in Miami?

249
00:15:08,836 --> 00:15:10,770
I never left.

250
00:15:12,406 --> 00:15:14,741
Oh, there's so much blood.

251
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:17,644
What do I do?

252
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:18,745
Hello?

253
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,513
Hello?

254
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:22,448
Dexter, don't hang up on me!

255
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:26,920
Please, help me.

256
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:29,889
Don't move.
Don't do anything.

257
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,075
The M-99 will wear off
in a few short hours...

258
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:52,512
Not much time to contain
the situation...

259
00:15:52,546 --> 00:15:58,484
Not much time to protect
my simple life.

260
00:16:01,622 --> 00:16:03,222
? ?

261
00:16:09,196 --> 00:16:12,498
First, for good luck...
Let me see your neck.

262
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:14,133
? ?

263
00:16:25,646 --> 00:16:28,047
I fucking love my job.

264
00:16:28,082 --> 00:16:30,817
Look, I'm gonna go
take a lap through the V.I.P.

265
00:16:34,822 --> 00:16:36,689
- She's cute.
- Yeah, she's all right.

266
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:40,626
I could do you both.

267
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:45,064
That's the sixth girl
that's hit on him.

268
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:46,866
Wow.

269
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,901
Let's focus on camera three.

270
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:52,138
That guy, is he hooked up
with the Fuentes brothers?

271
00:16:52,172 --> 00:16:54,607
Hey, I'm gonna stay on Quinn.
He may need some backup.

272
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:57,744
He is supposed to he focusing
on the Fuentes brothers.

273
00:16:57,778 --> 00:16:59,712
He's not supposed to be playing
with her fun bags.

274
00:17:01,782 --> 00:17:03,082
Sounds like someone's jealous.

275
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:07,120
Why on God's green earth
would I be jealous?

276
00:17:08,455 --> 00:17:10,423
Quinn's a good guy.

277
00:17:10,457 --> 00:17:12,258
I'm not interested.

278
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:17,230
Out there on the dance floor,
shaking his tail feathers.

279
00:17:17,264 --> 00:17:18,264
Really not interested.

280
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:19,766
Stay single as long as you can.

281
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:24,003
- Says the newlywed.
- Don't remind me.

282
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:25,805
You've been married
for five minutes.

283
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,473
What happened to
the honeymoon phase?

284
00:17:27,508 --> 00:17:29,242
I blinked.

285
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:56,302
Show me where he is.

286
00:17:56,336 --> 00:18:00,306
There was so much blood
I had... I had to walk away.

287
00:18:03,043 --> 00:18:05,044
The body's in here.

288
00:18:06,513 --> 00:18:08,448
- Anybody see you?
- I don't think so.

289
00:18:08,482 --> 00:18:11,017
- Oh, God, I hope not.
- You killed somebody.

290
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:12,251
Because you
wouldn't do it for me!

291
00:18:12,286 --> 00:18:13,753
But you call me
to clean up after you.

292
00:18:13,787 --> 00:18:15,321
I didn't know what to do
with the body!

293
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:17,890
- I don't believe this.
- Just go if you want to go.

294
00:18:17,925 --> 00:18:19,725
Go?
I'm responsible for you.

295
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,427
Everything you do leads
right back to me.

296
00:18:21,462 --> 00:18:23,963
I didn't think it would be
so hard to kill someone.

297
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:31,804
- Where is he?
- Here.

298
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:35,441
Oh, shit!

299
00:18:35,476 --> 00:18:37,743
- He was right here.
- Are you sure?

300
00:18:37,778 --> 00:18:39,912
He was dead.

301
00:18:39,947 --> 00:18:42,682
- Apparently not.
- Don't get mad at me.

302
00:18:42,716 --> 00:18:44,283
This isn't how I was planning
to spend my evening.

303
00:18:44,318 --> 00:18:45,585
Me neither.

304
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:46,752
Would you do me a favor?

305
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:48,321
- What?
- Stop talking.

306
00:18:48,355 --> 00:18:52,425
He's lost a lot of blood,
at least a pint.

307
00:18:54,628 --> 00:18:58,264
One...Two...

308
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:03,736
Three...Four.

309
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,671
You're a terrible shot.

310
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:07,406
But you never shot
a gun before.

311
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:08,908
You didn't anticipate
the kickback...

312
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:10,576
One of the many things
you didn't anticipate.

313
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:11,978
Give me the gun.

314
00:19:15,449 --> 00:19:18,317
You must have hit him once.

315
00:19:18,352 --> 00:19:21,587
Where was the point of impact?

316
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:24,223
Where were you standing?

317
00:19:27,895 --> 00:19:31,030
He was standing here.
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

318
00:19:31,064 --> 00:19:32,632
I go down, you run away.

319
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,167
I get back up,
and where do I go?

320
00:19:37,838 --> 00:19:40,406
Here.

321
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:44,777
Come on.

322
00:19:51,084 --> 00:19:52,618
How'd you even find this guy?

323
00:19:56,023 --> 00:19:57,890
You can talk now.

324
00:19:57,925 --> 00:20:01,060
The night that I was taken,
I had gone to a bar.

325
00:20:01,094 --> 00:20:02,695
I thought that
they spotted me there,

326
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:04,997
so I went back to that same bar
night after night,

327
00:20:05,032 --> 00:20:07,333
hoping that one of them
would walk through the door.

328
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:09,735
- I wore a disguise.
- Disguise?

329
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,804
A wig, so they
wouldn't recognize me.

330
00:20:11,838 --> 00:20:13,472
I know what a disguise is for.

331
00:20:13,507 --> 00:20:14,974
So you went to the bar.

332
00:20:15,008 --> 00:20:16,976
You waited for one of them
to show up.

333
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,678
Where? What bar?

334
00:20:18,712 --> 00:20:21,747
Hurricane 26.

335
00:20:21,782 --> 00:20:24,550
Hurricane 26 is all the way
over on Ocean Avenue.

336
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:26,352
How'd you get all the way
out here?

337
00:20:26,386 --> 00:20:28,688
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

338
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:30,089
So go on.

339
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:31,924
Tonight one of them showed up.

340
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:34,493
He didn't know it was me,
so I-I flirted with him.

341
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:36,696
I asked him if he wanted
to go someplace else.

342
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,931
We got in the car,
I pulled out my gun,

343
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:40,566
and I forced him to drive.

344
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:42,735
This place seemed deserted,
so we stopped,

345
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:43,903
and I marched him inside.

346
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:45,671
- And you shot him.
- No.

347
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:47,607
I asked him for the names
of the other men.

348
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:50,376
He called me a cunt.
Then I shot him.

349
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,578
How'd you know
he was one of them?

350
00:20:52,613 --> 00:20:56,048
I just...
I just knew.

351
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,184
You recognize his face?

352
00:20:58,218 --> 00:21:00,453
No. They kept me blindfolded
most of the time.

353
00:21:02,856 --> 00:21:04,023
So how?

354
00:21:04,057 --> 00:21:06,359
I felt it the minute
he walked in the door.

355
00:21:06,393 --> 00:21:09,929
One of the guys
had this smell...

356
00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:11,964
Like old sweat or,
I don't know, chlorine.

357
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:13,966
When I got in the car
with this guy,

358
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:15,768
there it was,
the exact same stench.

359
00:21:15,802 --> 00:21:18,871
You shot someone
based on a feeling and an odor.

360
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:20,873
I shot the right guy.

361
00:21:20,907 --> 00:21:23,909
You were willing to shoot the
wrong guy under Tuttle Bridge.

362
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:26,245
This guy was one of them.

363
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,048
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

364
00:21:29,082 --> 00:21:31,417
Did you check his wallet?

365
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:32,818
No.

366
00:21:32,853 --> 00:21:34,920
- Did you take his cell phone?
- Uh...

367
00:21:34,955 --> 00:21:36,489
He could have already called
the police, you know.

368
00:21:36,523 --> 00:21:37,623
I'm new to this!

369
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:38,958
You don't even know
who you shot!

370
00:21:38,992 --> 00:21:40,559
I shot one of the creeps
who raped me.

371
00:21:40,594 --> 00:21:42,828
- You don't have any proof.
- I'm the proof!

372
00:21:42,863 --> 00:21:45,131
My memory!
My experience!

373
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:47,466
Hardly the most reliable tools.

374
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:50,369
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

375
00:21:51,805 --> 00:21:53,739
Wow.

376
00:21:53,774 --> 00:21:56,342
Just go.

377
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:59,945
I can find him on my own
and kill him.

378
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,449
Like you killed him
the first time?

379
00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:05,451
I have no idea
which direction he went...

380
00:22:05,485 --> 00:22:08,521
If he turned right or...

381
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:15,328
Blood swipe.

382
00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:17,463
He stopped here
to catch his breath.

383
00:22:17,497 --> 00:22:19,765
Leaned against the post,
put his hand here.

384
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,736
The directionality
of the blood leads which way?

385
00:22:26,306 --> 00:22:28,207
This way.

386
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:31,177
You sure know a lot
about blood.

387
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:34,914
So hypothetically,

388
00:22:34,948 --> 00:22:37,183
an office romance is just
the worst idea ever.

389
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:38,918
Yeah, I would advise
against it.

390
00:22:38,952 --> 00:22:42,888
But hypothetically...

391
00:22:42,923 --> 00:22:45,257
I can see how you and Quinn
make a lot of sense.

392
00:22:45,292 --> 00:22:47,426
So you would advise against it,

393
00:22:47,461 --> 00:22:48,761
but we make a lot of sense?

394
00:22:48,795 --> 00:22:51,297
What can I say?
I'm a romantic at heart.

395
00:22:51,331 --> 00:22:52,698
Then why don't you do something

396
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:53,899
to patch stuff up
with your wife?

397
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:56,369
- It's not that simple.
- It is that simple.

398
00:22:56,403 --> 00:22:57,903
Get your head out of your ass

399
00:22:57,938 --> 00:23:00,606
and do something nice for her.

400
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,142
Buy her a card, some flowers,

401
00:23:03,176 --> 00:23:04,276
get her a puppy.

402
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:07,046
A puppy?

403
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,184
Batista.

404
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:14,987
Where?

405
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:17,156
Baywater marina.

406
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,825
Warehouse 12.
I'll be right there.

407
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,294
- Possible homicide.
- I'll get it.

408
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:23,929
No, I'll go.
This is your baby.

409
00:23:23,964 --> 00:23:25,798
We've been on this for weeks

410
00:23:25,832 --> 00:23:27,733
and had nothing but our asses
handed to us.

411
00:23:27,768 --> 00:23:29,135
And if for some reason
the Fuentes brothers

412
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:31,270
show up tonight, then they've
already seen my face,

413
00:23:31,304 --> 00:23:33,372
so I'm useless.

414
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:35,608
And you won't have to see
Quinn hitting on other women.

415
00:23:35,642 --> 00:23:37,977
I don't know
what you're talking about.

416
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:41,080
- Yeah. Good luck.
- Yeah, you too.

417
00:23:50,023 --> 00:23:53,559
Mm...Who are you?

418
00:23:56,863 --> 00:23:58,130
No dial tone.

419
00:23:58,165 --> 00:23:59,698
He didn't call anybody.

420
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:02,034
Who even uses
a pay phone anymore?

421
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:03,836
People who don't have
cell phones.

422
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,571
We caught a break.

423
00:24:05,605 --> 00:24:08,741
But he could have gone
anywhere.

424
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:17,983
What are you doing?

425
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:20,886
- It's luminol.
- Luminol?

426
00:24:20,921 --> 00:24:22,988
No relation.

427
00:24:23,023 --> 00:24:26,792
The hydrogen peroxide
and sodium hydroxide react

428
00:24:26,827 --> 00:24:29,061
with the iron present
in hemoglobin

429
00:24:29,095 --> 00:24:32,698
and exhibit A...Blue glow...
See?

430
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:34,900
Why do you have that
in your purse?

431
00:24:34,935 --> 00:24:37,336
It's not a purse.

432
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,839
And I use this almost
every day.

433
00:24:41,908 --> 00:24:43,542
Oh...

434
00:24:43,577 --> 00:24:45,144
What is it?

435
00:24:45,178 --> 00:24:47,480
A crime scene.

436
00:24:47,514 --> 00:24:49,215
A crime scene?

437
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:53,018
- Are you...

438
00:24:53,053 --> 00:24:54,386
A police officer?

439
00:24:54,421 --> 00:24:56,388
"Baywater marina,
warehouse 12."

440
00:24:56,423 --> 00:24:59,792
Isn't that...

441
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:03,796
Here?

442
00:25:07,901 --> 00:25:09,969
Shit.
Somebody did see you.

443
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:12,605
- Oh, fuck!
- We still have time.

444
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:14,840
Patrol can't move until homicide
arrives on the scene.

445
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:17,409
That's at least 15 minutes
from now.

446
00:25:17,444 --> 00:25:19,078
How long have you been a cop?

447
00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:21,947
- I'm not a cop.
- Well, what are you?

448
00:25:21,982 --> 00:25:24,850
Complicated.

449
00:25:30,423 --> 00:25:33,325
This way. Hurry up.

450
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:42,201
Running pumps the heart faster,

451
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:46,405
and more blood is spilled.

452
00:25:51,745 --> 00:25:54,446
Look here, how the drops
are pooling...

453
00:25:54,481 --> 00:25:56,916
Getting closer together.

454
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,785
- He's slowing down?
- Yeah.

455
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:02,521
This way.

456
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:16,235
This started out
as an ordinary day.

457
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:19,972
In one second,
everything changed.

458
00:26:20,006 --> 00:26:22,141
Lumen happened.

459
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:23,342
Why are you here in Miami?

460
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:25,344
You were getting on a plane
to Minneapolis.

461
00:26:25,378 --> 00:26:28,347
I tried to get on that plane.
I couldn't.

462
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:29,982
I had to stay.

463
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,117
The guy I shot tonight,

464
00:26:32,152 --> 00:26:34,420
he would take
these three fingers...

465
00:26:34,454 --> 00:26:36,989
- You don't have to tell...
- And shove them in my mouth.

466
00:26:37,023 --> 00:26:40,659
It tasted like metal.

467
00:26:40,694 --> 00:26:45,331
He would keep them there,
so I couldn't scream.

468
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:47,733
The other guys would just stuff
a dirty rag in my mouth,

469
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:49,435
but not this guy.

470
00:26:49,469 --> 00:26:52,371
He liked
to hold me down himself.

471
00:26:54,608 --> 00:26:58,210
I saw everything.

472
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:02,615
How?
You were blindfolded.

473
00:27:09,956 --> 00:27:11,790
Is this your monster?

474
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,880
Pardon me,
but I couldn't help noticing

475
00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:36,649
that you've been hanging out
with a fool.

476
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:39,685
Mm. How do you know?

477
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:44,490
<i>'Cause whoever stood you up
es un idiota.</i>

478
00:27:44,524 --> 00:27:47,826
- I'm Angel.
- Yasmin.

479
00:27:47,861 --> 00:27:50,696
- My favorite flower.
- Ooh.

480
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,697
- No?
- Mmm.

481
00:27:51,731 --> 00:27:54,133
Okay.

482
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,972
Do you want to get
out of here, Yasminita?

483
00:28:07,447 --> 00:28:09,348
Yeah.

484
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:17,690
It hurts!
Oh, my God!

485
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:19,758
Calm down!

486
00:28:19,793 --> 00:28:22,995
God. Okay.

487
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:24,063
What are you doing?

488
00:28:24,097 --> 00:28:27,199
I'm gonna inspect your wounds.

489
00:28:29,736 --> 00:28:33,105
Yeah, one gunshot wound
penetrated the abdominal cavity.

490
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:36,575
Oh, God.

491
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:37,810
Can't let me die.

492
00:28:37,844 --> 00:28:38,911
Come over here and hold this.

493
00:28:38,945 --> 00:28:40,345
You're gonna save him?

494
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,880
I don't know who this man is.

495
00:28:41,915 --> 00:28:45,150
My name's Dan.
Dan Mendell.

496
00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:47,553
This woman right here,
she shot me.

497
00:28:47,587 --> 00:28:48,954
I have no idea why.

498
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:50,689
You know exactly
what you did to me!

499
00:28:50,724 --> 00:28:52,291
I've never seen this woman
before in my life.

500
00:28:52,325 --> 00:28:55,761
- You're a fucking liar!
- You're fucking crazy!

501
00:28:55,795 --> 00:28:59,431
Look, you can't let me die.
I got a wife.

502
00:28:59,466 --> 00:29:03,569
I got a daughter.
Please. Just look.

503
00:29:03,603 --> 00:29:06,405
Dan Mendell, D.D.S.,
kids' dentist.

504
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:07,573
He's a rapist.

505
00:29:07,607 --> 00:29:09,174
I never did anything to you.

506
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:10,309
We met in a bar.

507
00:29:10,343 --> 00:29:11,543
But she came on to me.

508
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:12,778
And then we get in the car,

509
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:14,813
- she pulls a gun on me.
- You panicked.

510
00:29:14,848 --> 00:29:16,482
Because
you were gonna shoot me.

511
00:29:16,516 --> 00:29:17,983
No, because you recognized me.

512
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:19,885
No. I've never seen you before
in my life.

513
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,255
- You know exactly who I am!
- She's crazy.

514
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:26,291
We got a mental situation
going on here.

515
00:29:26,326 --> 00:29:27,926
- You in the corner.
- You believe him?

516
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:29,595
She needs help.

517
00:29:29,629 --> 00:29:31,497
- This woman needs help.
- You're a piece of shit.

518
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:34,900
- Full of shit!
- Over there.

519
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:38,036
I have to take this call.
Stay there till I get back.

520
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:39,605
Don't leave me alone with her!

521
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:42,908
Do not move from this spot.

522
00:29:42,942 --> 00:29:47,646
Ah, help!

523
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,316
- Everything okay?
- Die-die.

524
00:29:51,351 --> 00:29:53,452
Hi-hi. Harrison.

525
00:29:53,486 --> 00:29:54,620
I know you're working,

526
00:29:54,654 --> 00:29:56,288
but I thought you might want
to take a break.

527
00:29:56,322 --> 00:29:59,091
- It's wild hearing him talk.
- Isn't it?

528
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:01,093
I put him down,
and he was up two hours later

529
00:30:01,127 --> 00:30:03,662
talking up a storm,
weren't you?

530
00:30:03,696 --> 00:30:07,499
? Flies in the buttermilk,
shoo fly shoo ?

531
00:30:07,534 --> 00:30:09,101
Here, let me get you
on the speaker,

532
00:30:09,135 --> 00:30:11,336
and you can sing to him too.

533
00:30:11,371 --> 00:30:15,007
? Lost my partner,
what'll I do? ?

534
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,408
Dexter.

535
00:30:16,442 --> 00:30:19,511
? Lost my partner,
what'll I do? ?

536
00:30:19,546 --> 00:30:23,182
? lost my partner,
what'll I do? ?

537
00:30:23,216 --> 00:30:26,819
? skip to the Lou, my darling ?

538
00:30:26,853 --> 00:30:28,620
Well, I don't want to keep you.

539
00:30:28,655 --> 00:30:30,489
I'm afraid to ask, but...

540
00:30:30,523 --> 00:30:32,624
You want me to stay
a few more hours?

541
00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:33,826
I'll be home as soon as I can.

542
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,327
There's no place
I'd rather be right now.

543
00:30:35,361 --> 00:30:38,997
- Believe me.
- Die-die.

544
00:30:39,032 --> 00:30:42,234
Die-die.
I love you.

545
00:30:46,973 --> 00:30:48,507
- Who are they?
- Get off of me!

546
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:49,808
What are their names?

547
00:30:49,843 --> 00:30:52,277
I don't know
what you're talking about!

548
00:30:52,312 --> 00:30:55,514
Huh?

549
00:30:55,548 --> 00:30:59,918
He's a fucking liar!
He knows who they are!

550
00:30:59,953 --> 00:31:02,721
Who are they?
What are their names?

551
00:31:02,755 --> 00:31:05,591
You are ruining my life!

552
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:09,628
They ruined mine.

553
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:14,867
If we don't get help,

554
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:16,602
Dan the dentist is going
to expire.

555
00:31:16,636 --> 00:31:19,805
I don't care.
It's what he deserves.

556
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:23,976
- It's what they all deserve.
- Shh.

557
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,111
They should all get...

558
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:27,479
He's saying something.

559
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:30,182
- He's talking to someone.
- She fucking shot me.

560
00:31:30,216 --> 00:31:33,685
- My phone.
- Can you hear me?

561
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,422
She shot me.

562
00:31:37,457 --> 00:31:40,592
She's alive.
You hear me?

563
00:31:42,629 --> 00:31:46,565
That last fucking bitch
is alive.

564
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:08,320
They're gonna find you...

565
00:32:08,354 --> 00:32:11,957
You cunt.

566
00:32:13,626 --> 00:32:15,827
Die-die.

567
00:32:25,171 --> 00:32:26,972
Lumen didn't witness
her mother's murder,

568
00:32:27,006 --> 00:32:30,409
but she was born in blood...

569
00:32:30,443 --> 00:32:33,312
Like me.

570
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:37,349
Some experiences are so big,
they change your DNA.

571
00:32:37,383 --> 00:32:41,186
What now?

572
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,323
We clean up.
Homicide will be on us soon.

573
00:32:46,793 --> 00:32:47,960
Hose this area down.

574
00:32:47,994 --> 00:32:49,828
Make sure everything flows
through the grate.

575
00:32:53,132 --> 00:32:55,400
Where are you going?

576
00:32:55,435 --> 00:32:59,371
To get my car.
We have to move this body.

577
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:08,847
About time.

578
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:10,916
Come on.

579
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,753
A hooker
called in some gunshots,

580
00:33:14,787 --> 00:33:16,455
but didn't actually see
the shooter.

581
00:33:16,489 --> 00:33:19,691
- Where's the body?
- Well, haven't found it yet.

582
00:33:19,726 --> 00:33:22,394
Then what are we doing here?

583
00:33:22,428 --> 00:33:26,732
Hey.

584
00:33:26,766 --> 00:33:29,167
Blood.

585
00:33:31,637 --> 00:33:33,672
Bullet holes,

586
00:33:33,706 --> 00:33:35,941
lots of blood,
a significant amount of blood...

587
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:39,277
definitely some sort
of homicidal situation here.

588
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:41,780
A homicidal situation
requires a body.

589
00:33:41,814 --> 00:33:43,215
Why don't we let the EMTs
handle it?

590
00:33:43,249 --> 00:33:44,683
Your average person
won't survive

591
00:33:44,717 --> 00:33:46,051
this amount of blood loss.

592
00:33:51,024 --> 00:33:53,725
There.
That blood trail there.

593
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,129
See it? Good chance that trail
ends at a dead body.

594
00:33:57,163 --> 00:33:59,031
- Dexter's en route, but...
- I get it. We can't wait.

595
00:33:59,065 --> 00:34:03,135
Will you two guys follow us in,
in case this bleeder's alive?

596
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:37,069
Whoa.

597
00:34:38,771 --> 00:34:41,706
This dude is a half liter
from dead.

598
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:44,709
Yeah.

599
00:34:44,744 --> 00:34:46,478
Hey, fuckwad, are you taking
the scenic route?

600
00:34:46,512 --> 00:34:49,281
Sorry. I was, uh,
with Harrison.

601
00:34:49,315 --> 00:34:52,918
He said his first words...
"Bye-bye."

602
00:34:52,952 --> 00:34:55,687
- Yeah? That's sweet.
- Yeah, it was.

603
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:57,656
I remember your first words...

604
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,890
"Shoes."

605
00:34:58,925 --> 00:35:01,993
You were very girlie
once upon a time.

606
00:35:02,028 --> 00:35:04,596
That's funny, 'cause I always
remember my first words as being

607
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,730
"hurry the fuck up."

608
00:35:05,765 --> 00:35:06,932
Almost there.

609
00:35:06,966 --> 00:35:08,400
Masuka and I tracked
this dude's blood

610
00:35:08,434 --> 00:35:10,735
to a pay phone
inside a warehouse.

611
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,904
- You did?
- I think this way.

612
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:14,439
Yeah.
We're gonna keep going.

613
00:35:14,474 --> 00:35:16,575
- So find us.
- Will do.

614
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:30,055
You changed your clothes.

615
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:32,057
Here.
This is all I have.

616
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:33,525
Thanks.

617
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:35,794
The police are close.
You have to get out of here.

618
00:35:35,828 --> 00:35:39,397
Go to this address...
3319 Meadow Lane.

619
00:35:39,432 --> 00:35:41,433
It's near Kendall.
Say it back to me.

620
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:43,935
3319 Meadow Lane, near Kendall.

621
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,537
This'll get you
in the front door.

622
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:48,373
Run six, seven blocks.
Catch a cab.

623
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:49,808
Get cleaned up and wait for me.

624
00:35:49,842 --> 00:35:51,209
I have it from here.

625
00:35:51,244 --> 00:35:53,578
- You want me to go now?
- Yes.

626
00:35:53,613 --> 00:35:56,114
No, I'm not leaving you.

627
00:35:56,149 --> 00:35:58,550
Yes, you are.

628
00:35:58,584 --> 00:36:00,218
I-I can help you move
the body.

629
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:09,528
Who the hell is that?

630
00:36:09,562 --> 00:36:13,165
Go, now. Go!

631
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:17,569
Compartmentalization is a joke.

632
00:36:17,603 --> 00:36:20,739
Fires rip through buildings
all the time

633
00:36:20,773 --> 00:36:23,942
no matter how closed off
parts of them are.

634
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:25,343
Life is the same way.

635
00:36:27,146 --> 00:36:29,281
It cannot be contained.

636
00:37:09,222 --> 00:37:13,124
Fuck. Maybe we should
double back the way we came.

637
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,702
Is that...?

638
00:37:23,736 --> 00:37:26,238
Dexter's car.

639
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:34,045
Dexter.

640
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,314
You will not believe
what I found.

641
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:48,226
What in the mother of fuck
went on in here?

642
00:37:48,261 --> 00:37:50,729
I know exactly what happened.

643
00:37:50,763 --> 00:37:56,301
Two words...
autoerotic mummification.

644
00:37:56,335 --> 00:37:59,004
See, Mr. Plastic Man

645
00:37:59,038 --> 00:38:01,773
shot Captain Bloody Underpants

646
00:38:01,807 --> 00:38:04,576
while underpants
was in the choke.

647
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,346
Mr. Plastic Man has hammocks
between underpants' man chop...

648
00:38:08,381 --> 00:38:10,782
Thanks to Masuka's
keen expertise,

649
00:38:10,816 --> 00:38:13,118
Debra will be able
to close this case.

650
00:38:13,152 --> 00:38:16,888
Evidence will go into a
banker's box and be filed away,

651
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:20,992
eventually transferred to a
storage facility in Bradenton,

652
00:38:21,027 --> 00:38:22,761
and that is where it will stay,

653
00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:25,830
locked away
forever in the dark.

654
00:38:28,968 --> 00:38:32,704
If only everything
were that simple.

655
00:38:32,738 --> 00:38:34,272
Thank you for the visual.

656
00:38:34,307 --> 00:38:36,741
Asphyxiation
heightens the high,

657
00:38:36,776 --> 00:38:39,344
but it's not without its risks.

658
00:38:40,813 --> 00:38:44,282
Either way, I wouldn't touch
the nozzle of that hose.

659
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,888
Anything to add?

660
00:38:49,922 --> 00:38:53,425
The blood is consistent
with Masuka's theory.

661
00:38:53,459 --> 00:38:56,661
If there's any follow-up,
I'd be happy to do it.

662
00:38:56,696 --> 00:38:57,929
We're good here?

663
00:38:57,963 --> 00:38:59,864
You just landed.

664
00:38:59,899 --> 00:39:01,900
I have to relieve Sonya.

665
00:39:01,934 --> 00:39:04,436
Yeah, we're good.
Drive safe.

666
00:39:07,873 --> 00:39:10,208
What a night.

667
00:39:13,379 --> 00:39:15,914
You sure you want to do this?

668
00:39:15,948 --> 00:39:18,149
I'm here, aren't I?

669
00:39:21,687 --> 00:39:25,256
Angel?

670
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:28,093
This is Yasmin Aragon.

671
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:30,762
What is she doing on my couch?

672
00:39:30,796 --> 00:39:35,567
Miss Aragon is friends
with los hermanos Fuentes.

673
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:39,871
She also has a boatload
of drug charges

674
00:39:39,905 --> 00:39:41,740
against her.

675
00:39:41,774 --> 00:39:45,210
Seems like a trade is in order.

676
00:39:45,244 --> 00:39:48,446
So are we gonna do this or not?

677
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:53,084
Give us a minute.

678
00:39:56,222 --> 00:39:58,123
Excuse me.

679
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,870
I saw that she was wearing
a Santa Muerte necklace,

680
00:40:11,904 --> 00:40:14,372
so I introduced myself.

681
00:40:14,407 --> 00:40:17,075
If we agree to drop
her drug charges,

682
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:18,276
she thinks she can get

683
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,111
the Fuentes brothers
in the club.

684
00:40:20,146 --> 00:40:22,547
That is...

685
00:40:22,581 --> 00:40:26,885
If you're willing to give us
another chance.

686
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:30,989
I'm sorry about everything...

687
00:40:31,023 --> 00:40:34,058
About losing my temper,
about what I said earlier.

688
00:40:34,093 --> 00:40:36,094
You were right.

689
00:40:36,128 --> 00:40:38,897
Say that again?

690
00:40:38,931 --> 00:40:41,833
- You were right.
- I like the sound of that.

691
00:40:41,867 --> 00:40:43,301
I did go to I.A.D.

692
00:40:43,335 --> 00:40:45,236
because I didn't want
my husband disciplined.

693
00:40:45,271 --> 00:40:48,339
I really like
being married to you, Angel.

694
00:40:48,374 --> 00:40:49,841
And I you.

695
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,843
It's something I never thought
would happen to me

696
00:40:51,877 --> 00:40:54,546
because I've been so busy
making a name for myself,

697
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,347
and now I'm this close
to making captain.

698
00:40:56,382 --> 00:40:58,450
And I would never do
anything to stop you.

699
00:40:58,484 --> 00:41:00,485
Not on purpose, I know.

700
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:02,954
But get a stink on you,

701
00:41:02,988 --> 00:41:05,457
and I start to stink too.

702
00:41:05,491 --> 00:41:08,726
We'll stock up on deodorant.

703
00:41:10,996 --> 00:41:13,031
Nice job bringing in the girl.

704
00:41:13,065 --> 00:41:15,099
Yeah.

705
00:41:16,902 --> 00:41:19,771
Better than a puppy?

706
00:41:19,805 --> 00:41:21,840
I'll see you back at home.

707
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:38,122
Hello?

708
00:41:51,504 --> 00:41:52,470
Hey.

709
00:41:52,505 --> 00:41:54,272
Hey.

710
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:55,707
Last one.

711
00:41:55,741 --> 00:41:58,409
Sorry.

712
00:41:58,444 --> 00:41:59,978
You got glitter on your face.

713
00:42:00,012 --> 00:42:01,746
Yeah...

714
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,115
Hazard of the job.

715
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:06,184
I'm not sure
it's in the job description

716
00:42:06,218 --> 00:42:08,586
that you have to put your face
in Boobie McGee's tits.

717
00:42:08,621 --> 00:42:09,921
Well, you know,

718
00:42:09,955 --> 00:42:11,823
the first rule of working
undercover is to blend in.

719
00:42:11,857 --> 00:42:13,992
You disappeared.

720
00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:15,927
I did, didn't I?

721
00:42:15,961 --> 00:42:18,997
It's not funny.

722
00:42:19,031 --> 00:42:20,698
Fuck.

723
00:42:20,733 --> 00:42:23,334
I...

724
00:42:25,304 --> 00:42:27,071
I have feelings for you.

725
00:42:27,106 --> 00:42:29,541
You do?

726
00:42:29,575 --> 00:42:31,676
I tried not to.

727
00:42:33,979 --> 00:42:36,581
I like you too...

728
00:42:36,615 --> 00:42:40,685
Uh, more than "like."

729
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:41,753
You do?

730
00:42:41,787 --> 00:42:43,121
Yeah.

731
00:42:43,155 --> 00:42:46,791
I mean, you're the one
who keeps putting the brakes on.

732
00:42:46,825 --> 00:42:49,561
Well, what if I don't want
to do that anymore?

733
00:42:49,595 --> 00:42:52,096
That'd make me very happy.

734
00:42:55,668 --> 00:42:59,671
If this is gonna end badly...

735
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:01,973
Will you please
just tell me now?

736
00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:08,413
Morgan, I just said
I want to be with you.

737
00:43:08,447 --> 00:43:11,983
I mean, what more do you want?

738
00:43:12,017 --> 00:43:14,786
Well, I mean,
sometimes you mumble,

739
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,288
and it's kind of hard
to understand you.

740
00:43:17,323 --> 00:43:19,223
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

741
00:43:19,258 --> 00:43:21,693
How's this?

742
00:43:34,373 --> 00:43:37,609
I tried to send this woman
1,500 miles away,

743
00:43:37,643 --> 00:43:38,776
and she boomeranged

744
00:43:38,811 --> 00:43:41,312
back into the house
I shared with Rita.

745
00:43:41,347 --> 00:43:43,314
Lumen?

746
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:44,449
So much for keeping

747
00:43:44,483 --> 00:43:46,651
the different parts
of my life separate.

748
00:44:08,173 --> 00:44:10,041
Sorry, I'll just be in here.

749
00:44:19,184 --> 00:44:22,420
There are towels...
Somewhere.

750
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:26,958
I found some in a box.

751
00:44:26,992 --> 00:44:28,760
I also found this robe.

752
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:31,629
Is it okay if I borrow it?

753
00:44:31,664 --> 00:44:34,032
Sure.

754
00:44:37,036 --> 00:44:40,905
The tub's not draining.

755
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:43,474
Sometimes
the thingy gets stuck.

756
00:44:53,218 --> 00:44:54,585
Are you okay?

757
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,187
Do you need to sit down?

758
00:45:01,326 --> 00:45:03,461
Yeah, for a minute.

759
00:45:08,967 --> 00:45:10,935
I know you...

760
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:12,770
What you are...

761
00:45:12,805 --> 00:45:14,572
Deep down...

762
00:45:14,606 --> 00:45:16,240
aside from your police job

763
00:45:16,275 --> 00:45:19,677
and your
extracurricular activities.

764
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,449
You're a father.

765
00:45:24,483 --> 00:45:27,652
I saw the pictures out there.

766
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:29,420
Three children?

767
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:35,660
The two oldest
are with their grandparents...

768
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:40,131
Their dad's mom and dad.

769
00:45:40,165 --> 00:45:42,767
You have a son?

770
00:45:42,801 --> 00:45:44,602
Harrison.

771
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:48,840
He just started talking...

772
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:51,476
Today.

773
00:45:54,446 --> 00:45:56,848
He's tremendous.

774
00:46:00,285 --> 00:46:03,187
It's...

775
00:46:03,222 --> 00:46:05,189
Just the two of you?

776
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:10,361
And an Irish superhero nanny.

777
00:46:16,668 --> 00:46:19,370
Never thought my life
would turn out like this.

778
00:46:25,177 --> 00:46:27,378
I had imagined...

779
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:30,882
A totally different life
for myself too.

780
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:33,384
I always did everything
by the book, you know?

781
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:34,852
Go, go, go.

782
00:46:34,887 --> 00:46:38,222
Never stopped to think.

783
00:46:38,257 --> 00:46:42,593
There was high school and
college and graduate school...

784
00:46:42,628 --> 00:46:44,962
Owen.

785
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:52,570
We were gonna get married
at the house that I grew up in.

786
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:55,706
On my wedding day, I...

787
00:46:55,741 --> 00:46:58,042
I tried on the dress,
and I looked out the window

788
00:46:58,076 --> 00:47:01,479
at the backyard
where the aisle was, and...

789
00:47:01,513 --> 00:47:05,983
I saw everything
that that aisle was leading to...

790
00:47:06,018 --> 00:47:08,653
babies and...

791
00:47:08,687 --> 00:47:11,556
Matching dinnerware...

792
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:14,025
Sunday barbecues.

793
00:47:15,894 --> 00:47:19,096
And I couldn't breathe.

794
00:47:19,131 --> 00:47:21,465
I had to get
out of there and...

795
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,670
Find something...

796
00:47:25,704 --> 00:47:28,105
More.

797
00:47:35,914 --> 00:47:40,551
Then everything happened,
and...

798
00:47:40,586 --> 00:47:42,887
I actually thought,

799
00:47:42,921 --> 00:47:45,489
"this is what I get

800
00:47:45,524 --> 00:47:49,060
for trying to...

801
00:47:49,094 --> 00:47:51,395
Live my own life."

802
00:47:53,198 --> 00:47:55,433
Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?

803
00:47:58,003 --> 00:48:00,238
A little.

804
00:48:03,775 --> 00:48:08,145
But tonight
I felt this, like...

805
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,681
This...

806
00:48:10,716 --> 00:48:12,750
Peace.

807
00:48:14,786 --> 00:48:16,787
And it's because he's dead.

808
00:48:23,996 --> 00:48:28,266
And I know
that it's not gonna last.

809
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,600
And when it wears off,

810
00:48:29,635 --> 00:48:33,337
I'm gonna have to find
the rest of them...

811
00:48:33,372 --> 00:48:34,939
Because that's the only way

812
00:48:34,973 --> 00:48:37,742
that I'll find
that peace again.

813
00:48:42,447 --> 00:48:46,517
I don't even have a name
for what I'm feeling.

814
00:48:46,551 --> 00:48:48,019
I do...

815
00:48:48,053 --> 00:48:50,855
The dark passenger.

816
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:53,524
I can't get revenge
for Rita's death,

817
00:48:53,558 --> 00:48:57,461
but I can help Lumen
avenge what was done to her.

818
00:49:03,235 --> 00:49:06,771
How many more were there?

819
00:49:11,476 --> 00:49:21,478
