<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

4
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,626
So how the hell was your date
with Rita last night?

5
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,595
Great. I think I met
the right woman for me.

6
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,900
She's perfect, because Rita
is as damaged as me.

7
00:01:57,935 --> 00:01:59,769
I can't believe I found
the one good,

8
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:02,038
truly decent man
left on the planet.

9
00:02:03,574 --> 00:02:06,410
- I have a dark side too.
- Somehow I doubt that.

10
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:10,548
I watched my mother die
when I was three.

11
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,883
Aah!

12
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:13,618
She was murdered
in front of me.

13
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:15,053
You have your demons,

14
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:16,822
but I know that you don't
have to be a slave to them.

15
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:18,057
I wish that were true.

16
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:20,393
I want to someday be content

17
00:02:20,427 --> 00:02:21,728
like everyone else.

18
00:02:21,762 --> 00:02:24,397
I want...
A normal life.

19
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:26,066
- I wanna marry you.
- Yes!

20
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,868
You guys are my family.

21
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:31,806
Now I have a partner for life.
I'm content.

22
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,675
Maybe even happy.

23
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:35,576
I hope you're not taking
any of this seriously...

24
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:37,545
the wife, the kids.

25
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:38,779
It's all great camouflage.

26
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:40,515
It's gotten more
complicated than that.

27
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:42,250
I'm pregnant.

28
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:44,520
You want to see him
come into the world.

29
00:02:44,554 --> 00:02:45,788
Yes.

30
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:48,490
Raise him with Rita.
I know.

31
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:50,359
I've never wanted anything
so much in my life.

32
00:02:50,393 --> 00:02:54,563
Wanna know a secret?
Daddy kills people.

[Muffled scream]

34
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:00,603
There's a monster
walking around free.

35
00:03:00,637 --> 00:03:02,772
I call him the Trinity killer.

36
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:04,574
Kills in threes.

37
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:07,811
Trinity's a husband, a father.

38
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:09,680
He's...Like me.

39
00:03:09,714 --> 00:03:12,616
What kind of father
keeps blood slides in his shed?

40
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,284
If I don't figure out
how to hide this,

41
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,954
I'm gonna lose my family.

42
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,123
Arthur's kept this up
for what... 20 years?

43
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,892
My family
may not last 20 minutes.

44
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:24,061

Kyle Butler.

46
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,930
Only way it was gonna work

47
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:28,699
is if I jumped in
with both feet.

48
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,801
Jump in with both feet, huh?

49
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,136
This is your
new role model, Dex?

50
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,072
Get that ax from him.
Kill him now.

51
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:39,075
I still have things
to learn from him.

52
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:41,276
You're juggling
too many people, Dexter.

53
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:44,245
Blood tech, husband, father,
serial killer.

54
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,147
Now Kyle Butler.
Which one are you?

55
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:47,315
All of them.

56
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:48,582

is gonna be amazing.

Born in blood.
Both of us.

67
00:04:21,683 --> 00:04:23,818
I thought I could
change what I am,

68
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:27,388
keep my family safe.

69
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:30,825
But it doesn't matter
what I do.

70
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:32,026
This is fate.

Sir, did you call this in?

76
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:09,832
Sir.
What happened here?

77
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:13,702
[Crying grows distant, echoes]

78
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:16,338
I've watched 67 people die...

79
00:05:16,372 --> 00:05:19,908
And at the moment of truth,
I looked into their eyes

80
00:05:19,943 --> 00:05:21,978
and they knew and I knew

81
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:24,513
they got what they deserved.

82
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:27,317
But what if that's not
what happens?

83
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:30,186
If you don't get
what you deserve?

84
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,922
If what you deserve
is a white picket fence

85
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:35,591
and your kids all around

86
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,595
and a husband who loves you?

87
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,164
What if the least you deserve
is a real human being

88
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:46,203
and what you get instead is me?

89
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:50,240
Sir. Sir, we're going to take
the child into safe custody now.

90
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:53,377
Sir, hand me the child.
What are you doing?

91
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:54,378

He is too.

93

98

in the alkaline water.

Rigor mortis full-blown.

Epidermal mottling.

103
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:30,878
I imagined her naked
plenty of times,

104
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:32,413
but never like this.

105
00:06:34,716 --> 00:06:36,550
Single cut
to the femoral artery.

106
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:38,319
We're looking at
Trinity's M.O. here.

107
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:41,021
Did he ever kill a married
woman in a bathtub?

108
00:06:41,056 --> 00:06:43,358
First time for everything.

109
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:45,360
Unfortunately for Dexter.

110
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:52,234
We're still waiting
on the coroner to move the body.

111
00:06:52,268 --> 00:06:54,403
But overall lividity
puts time of death

112
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:59,474
somewhere between
8 and 12 hours...Ago.

You okay?

116
00:07:17,793 --> 00:07:19,694
Dexter came home to that.

117
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:23,731
He's gonna need
our support here.

118
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:25,599
Obviously.

119
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:28,635
What do you want us
to do with him?

120
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,870
The first thing
I want you to do

121
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:32,806
is pack up and get outta there.

122
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,408
- Well...
- What?

123
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:36,577
The FBI's here.
Trinity's their case.

124
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:38,212
I already ceded jurisdiction.

125
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:40,047
What are you looking
at him for?

126
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:42,483
It's what I was saying
on the way over.

127
00:07:42,518 --> 00:07:45,821
Rita's one of ours.
She's family.

128

<i>We should be working
on this for Dexter.</i>

Damn it, Angel, it's done!

130
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:52,896
Just do what I say.

131
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,165

We all are.

00:08:15,983 --> 00:08:19,319
My father Harry
taught me a few simple rules.

136
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:22,322
Never hurt an innocent
and never make a scene.

137
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,594
Harry?

138
00:08:30,665 --> 00:08:34,134
Where are you, now,
when I really need you?

139
00:08:36,604 --> 00:08:38,572
When it's my wife
in the body bag,

140
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:39,673
everybody's looking,

141
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:43,878

not me?

Sir?

We're ready for you.

147
00:09:02,264 --> 00:09:04,433
The first responders told me

148
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:06,502
when they went inside
and found your wife

149
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:09,840
you said, "it was me."

150
00:09:09,874 --> 00:09:11,675
You sure?

151
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:15,212
That's what was reported
to me, yeah.

152
00:09:15,246 --> 00:09:17,413
I don't know what I said.

153
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:19,382
It could have been anything.
I'm very upset.

154
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,285
Of course you are.
Who wouldn't be?

155
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:23,419
Mr. Morgan,

156
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:26,221
before you came home
and found your wife,

157
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:27,723
where did you say
you were again?

158
00:09:27,757 --> 00:09:29,391
Dexter, take off your clothes,
then we're going home.

159
00:09:29,425 --> 00:09:31,193
- I was asking him a question.
- He already said he came home

160
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:32,527
and he found her there.

161
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:34,930
If you wanna help,
why don't you find Trinity?

162
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:36,465
Or is doing something
actually useful

163
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,034
not in your fucking
job description?

164

- Detective Morgan.
- FBI?

165
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:41,971
Fucking bunch of idiots.

166
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:43,606
Stop.

167
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:45,609
Finish up here,
then take your brother home.

168
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:49,213
You wanna talk to Dexter,
schedule an appointment.

169
00:09:49,247 --> 00:09:51,816
I'll do that.

170
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:10,736
He can sleep on the floor

171
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,773
until we can bring his crib
over from the house.

172
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:15,574
It'll be safest,
don't you think?

[Dexter grunts]

174
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,878
I gotta tell you, Dexter,

175
00:10:18,912 --> 00:10:21,114
don't say things like,
"it was me."

176
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:23,283
People will misunderstand.

177
00:10:23,317 --> 00:10:25,953
In fact, I don't understand.

178
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:29,023
What did you even mean?

179
00:10:35,398 --> 00:10:37,198
Dexter.

180
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:39,433
[Calmly] This is Dexter Morgan.

181
00:10:39,468 --> 00:10:42,769
3319 Meadow Lane.
What is your emergency?

182
00:10:42,804 --> 00:10:45,705
I just got home and found
my wife dead in the bathtub.

183
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,973
[Click]

184
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:48,608
What is this?

185
00:10:48,642 --> 00:10:50,209
The 911 call Dexter made.

186
00:10:50,243 --> 00:10:52,544
Listen.
[click]

187
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:55,114
I just got home and found
my wife dead in the bathtub.

188
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:57,650
Did you say your wife is dead?

189
00:10:57,684 --> 00:10:58,651
Yes, I did.

190
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:00,887
She has an approximately
1-inch incision

191
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:03,190
midway up her right thigh,
dissecting the femoral artery.

192
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:04,892
Right. That's enough.

193
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:06,126
He obviously's in shock.

194
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:07,895
"Midway up her right thigh?

195
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,297
Dissecting her femoral artery"?

196
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:12,234
- Habit of precision.
- His wife just died.

197
00:11:12,268 --> 00:11:14,403
He's submitting a lab report.

198
00:11:14,437 --> 00:11:15,737
Seriously,
the next door neighbor,

199
00:11:15,772 --> 00:11:17,039
the guy with the,
you know, forehead?

200
00:11:17,073 --> 00:11:20,309
He was more broken up about
Rita than Dexter was.

201
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:22,944
- So?
- So it's weird, that's all.

202
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:26,181
What are we working on here?

203
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:27,849
Not Rita.

204
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:32,687
It's Dexter's 911 call.

205
00:11:32,722 --> 00:11:34,222
Did you hear me or not?

206
00:11:34,256 --> 00:11:39,061
I said the case
is with the FBI now.

207
00:11:41,064 --> 00:11:43,132
You should have taken her
on a honeymoon.

208
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:50,539
You were right
about one thing...

209
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:53,141
that neighbor Elliot
being all broken up about Rita.

210
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:54,843
I'm thinking now
there's some things

211
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:56,745
I shouldn't have told Dexter.

212
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:00,049
What? What shouldn't you
have told him?

213
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,185
About a significant
exchange of saliva

214
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:06,388
I witnessed at Thanksgiving.

215
00:12:06,423 --> 00:12:08,657
As in a kiss.
Elliot and Rita?

216
00:12:08,692 --> 00:12:12,394
Dude was totally
in love with her.

217
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:14,363
- And Dexter knew.
- Yeah.

218
00:12:14,397 --> 00:12:16,698
If I'd known she was gonna...

219
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:21,703
I should have kept
my big mouth shut.

220
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,709
[Cell phone rings]

221
00:12:26,743 --> 00:12:34,716
[Ringing]

222
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:37,687
Could someone get that?
Deb?

223
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:38,721
[Ringing]

224
00:12:38,755 --> 00:12:40,722
Oh. Damn it.

225
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:46,061
Hello.

226
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:48,897
Dexter, it's Maura.
[carnival music in background]

227
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:50,332
Hello?

228
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:51,567
I'm sorry if I woke you,

229
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:54,770
but I have got two very
excited kids here,

230
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:56,772
and Rita's not answering.

231
00:12:56,806 --> 00:12:59,475
Yeah, there's something
you need to know.

232
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:00,776
Okay. Okay, okay.

233
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:04,080
But first somebody really
wants to talk with you.

234
00:13:04,114 --> 00:13:05,081
[Giggling]

235
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:07,650
Dexter!

236
00:13:07,684 --> 00:13:09,452
Hey, Cody, you okay?

237
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:11,220
We've been having the best day.

238
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:13,990
I had cotton candy
for breakfast.

239
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:15,859
That's great.
Astor: Here, give me the phone.

240
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:17,961
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

241
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:19,996
Hey, Dexter.
Can I talk to mom?

242
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:22,799
- Not now.
- Why not?

243
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,802
She's, uh...

244
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:27,337
She's in the shower.

245
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:30,206
Well...Can you tell her
we miss her?

246
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:33,310
Cody: We miss you too,
Dexter, and Harrison.

247
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:35,611
Astor: Here's my grandmother.

248
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:37,313
[Laughing]
So there was something

249
00:13:37,347 --> 00:13:39,749
that you needed to tell me?

250
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:42,418
When you bring them home
tonight, uh...

251
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:43,753
[Harrison fusses]

252
00:13:43,787 --> 00:13:47,824
Come to Deb's apartment
instead of the house...Okay?

253
00:13:47,858 --> 00:13:51,327
What happened,
did you miss your flight?

254
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:55,864
Something like that.
I'll explain when you get here.

255
00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:03,839
You sure you don't want
to tell them about Rita?

256
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:05,441
[Exhales]

257
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:09,344
I just want them to have
one more good day.

258
00:14:09,378 --> 00:14:13,013
Look, I know
this is really difficult...

259
00:14:13,048 --> 00:14:14,848
But there are a lot of things
that need to happen

260
00:14:14,883 --> 00:14:17,250
before Rita can be buried.

261
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:21,322
I've been on the phone
all morning

262
00:14:21,356 --> 00:14:23,758
with a funeral director
who does a lot of cops.

263
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:27,428
And he's willing to see us
right away.

264
00:14:29,764 --> 00:14:31,899
You willing to do that?

265
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:45,113
I'm sorry for your loss.

266
00:14:45,147 --> 00:14:47,082
How does he do that?

267
00:14:47,116 --> 00:14:49,351
My sincere condolences.

268
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:51,887
He sounds like
he actually means it.

269
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,291
Thank you.

270
00:14:56,325 --> 00:14:58,793
Would you like
something to drink?

271
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:01,063
Coffee?

272
00:15:01,097 --> 00:15:02,765
Water?

273
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,334
No. I'm fine.

274
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:08,003
[Harrison fusses]

275
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:14,608
There are kleenexes here...

276
00:15:14,642 --> 00:15:17,878
If you need them.

277
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:22,984
What we need to do now,
Dexter...

278
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:26,121
M-may I call you that?

279
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:27,556
What we need to do now, Dexter,

280
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:29,225
is make some very
important decisions

281
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:32,729
about how your wife Rita
will be remembered.

282
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:34,665
Okay.

283
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:37,601
We like to start with
the obituary.

284
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:39,536
It's a good way to let people
know about services

285
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,505
and where to send remembrances.

286
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:43,407
But most importantly,
it's a chance to express

287
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:45,542
your feelings about Rita
in your own words.

288
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,478
'Scuse me.

289
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,285
I'll get you something
for the paper.

290
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:57,288
What else do you need?

291
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,567
So this is how
normal people do it.

292
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,670
No hefty bags.
No diesel fumes.

293
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,408
[Sobbing]

294
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:20,377
This is what
she would have wanted...

295
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,546
a grieving spouse...

296
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,216
For once doing what
a person's supposed to do.

297
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:45,602
Dexter Morgan?

298
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:47,036
Rita?

299
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:49,706
Hi.
Hi.

300
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,174
Sorry I'm late.

301
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,675
That's no problem.

302
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,411
There was traffic, of course.

303
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:57,646
I went to the wrong cafe.

304
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:59,548
I went to the one in town.

305
00:16:59,582 --> 00:17:02,250
I didn't know there was
anything even out this far.

306
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:04,285
How did you find this place?

307
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,954
I, uh...
Tracked it down.

308
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,894
So I... your sister...

309
00:17:14,928 --> 00:17:16,730
Debra's told me
so much about you.

310
00:17:16,764 --> 00:17:18,732
- Uh-oh.
- Oh.

311
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:20,701
Nothing bad, of course.

312
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,903
She omitted the fact
that I'm an ax murderer?

313
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:26,073
No. She said that
you were a...

314
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:28,109
Bloodstain pattern analyst...

315
00:17:28,144 --> 00:17:30,412
Which I have no clue
what that is.

316
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:32,248
Believe me, I barely do either,

317
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:35,117
and I do it 40 hours a week.

318
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:38,721
She seems nice, your sister.

319
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:41,056
You seem nice too.

320
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,726
Thank you.

321
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,694
[Chuckles]

322
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:49,396
So, um, what's good here?

323
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:50,831
I mean,
there must be something special

324
00:17:50,865 --> 00:17:54,034
to bring you
all the way out this far.

325
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:55,902
I...

326
00:17:55,937 --> 00:17:57,571
I usually play it safe

327
00:17:57,606 --> 00:17:59,774
and go with a Caesar salad.

328
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:02,410
But I don't see one on here.

329
00:18:02,444 --> 00:18:05,646
You know, I think
I'm gonna get the special,

330
00:18:05,681 --> 00:18:07,081
the mushroom ravioli.

331
00:18:07,116 --> 00:18:08,883
Dexter?

332
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:12,488
Do you know what you want?

333
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:13,890
Yes, I do.

334
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:20,730
[Woman sobbing]

335
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,604
Dex.

336
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,141
What are you doing?

337
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:34,645
I was just thinking
about Rita, how much...

338
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,981
How much you miss her?

339
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,418
How much I lied to her,
from the very beginning.

340
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,895
Funeral's
the day after tomorrow.

341
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,466
I chose an oak casket.
I hope that's all right.

342
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,203
White roses.
I think she'd like those.

343
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,438
They want to know
if there's a particular dress

344
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,373
you'd like her to be buried in.

345
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,109
Not really.

346
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,846
Okay.

347
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,681
I'll find something.

348
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:13,351
Quinn called, and the FBI
has released the crime scene

349
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:14,852
at your house,

350
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,821
so there are some things
I want to do there and...

351
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,524
I'm gonna drop you two off
at the apartment.

352
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,626
Is that okay?

353
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,860
Yeah, that's fine.

354
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,696
[Woman sobbing]

355
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,632
You're worrying me.

356
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:58,826
I really didn't
expect you to come.

357
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:01,229
We're partners.
I'm here.

358
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:04,099
What are we looking for?

359
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:05,767
Nothing.

360
00:20:05,802 --> 00:20:09,238
Trinity wouldn't leave
anything behind.

361
00:20:09,272 --> 00:20:11,408
What are we doing then?

362
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,319
I wanted to clean the place up.

363
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,622
Make sure Dexter
didn't see it like this.

364
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:28,426
The FBI left it this way.

365
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,129
They have people
who'll do that.

366
00:21:26,654 --> 00:21:29,622
This much blood,
usually you call Dexter.

367
00:21:32,393 --> 00:21:35,095
How you holdin' up?

368
00:21:38,367 --> 00:21:40,902
Okay. I guess.

369
00:21:42,972 --> 00:21:45,974
I mean, you know my brother.
It's a little hard to tell.

370
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:49,012
No, I mean you.
How are you holding up?

371
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:50,780
Oh.

372
00:21:53,451 --> 00:21:54,718
Fine.

373
00:21:54,753 --> 00:21:58,288
Not used to having to be
the strong one, you know?

374
00:21:59,658 --> 00:22:01,526
It's always been Dexter.

375
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:06,063
And now...
He's the strong one?

376
00:22:06,098 --> 00:22:09,467
To me it's always seemed
the other way around.

377
00:22:12,404 --> 00:22:14,672
Swear to God, I can't even...

378
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:17,074
Tell what he's thinking.

379
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:18,341
[Whispering] Sorry.

380
00:22:18,376 --> 00:22:21,277
I didn't mean
to make things worse.

381
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:23,112
[Whispers] It's okay.

382
00:22:26,482 --> 00:22:29,984
What are you doing?
I don't know.

383
00:22:49,838 --> 00:22:52,473
[Knocking, kids' voices]

384
00:22:52,507 --> 00:22:55,276
Hurry, come on, open up!
Dexter!

385
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,645
[Knocking continues]
Maura: Are you there?

386
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,916
[Knocking, chattering]

387
00:23:02,118 --> 00:23:04,419
Dexter, you came back early!

388
00:23:04,454 --> 00:23:05,554
Oh!

389
00:23:05,588 --> 00:23:07,422
Hey, guys.
Did you have fun?

390
00:23:07,457 --> 00:23:09,825
- It was awesome.
- We got you stuff.

391
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:12,461
[Laughter]

392
00:23:12,495 --> 00:23:16,832
- Perfect.
- There's one for mom too.

393
00:23:21,271 --> 00:23:23,572
Where is she?

394
00:23:23,606 --> 00:23:26,575
She's not here.

395
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,445
Well, where is she?

396
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:31,113
Just...Sit down.

397
00:23:31,148 --> 00:23:33,849
I need to tell you something.

398
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:38,453
Dexter?

399
00:23:38,488 --> 00:23:40,789
Is everything okay?

400
00:23:40,823 --> 00:23:42,257
What's going on?
You're freaking...

401
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,692
you're freaking me out.

402
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:49,398
Something happened to your mom.

403
00:23:49,432 --> 00:23:51,833
Cody: Something bad?

404
00:23:56,472 --> 00:23:58,373
Yeah. Something bad.

405
00:23:58,408 --> 00:24:00,976
Is she okay?

406
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:05,481
A man came into our house,

407
00:24:05,516 --> 00:24:07,683
and your mother came home and...

408
00:24:07,717 --> 00:24:08,950
He killed her.

409
00:24:08,985 --> 00:24:10,618
Cody: What? She got killed?

410
00:24:10,653 --> 00:24:12,287
Somebody killed her?
Astor: No, she's fine.

411
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:13,888
Maura: Dexter.
What...

412
00:24:13,923 --> 00:24:16,491
Astor: You're kidding, right?
Maura: I don't understand.

413
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:19,193
You said spend the day
at Disney world.

414
00:24:19,228 --> 00:24:21,329
[Crying]

415
00:24:25,534 --> 00:24:27,368
I'm sorry for your loss.

416
00:24:27,403 --> 00:24:28,603
[Maura crying]

417
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:48,587
Astor?
Go away.

418
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:50,189
I mean it!
Leave me alone!

419
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:52,724
Just...Listen to me.
Everything's gonna be okay.

420
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,192
It won't be.

421
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:56,762
She's dead!

422
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:58,898
I know.

423
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:01,534
And it doesn't even
matter to you.

424
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:03,837
How can you say that?

425
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:05,672
'Cause it doesn't.

426
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:08,442
I can tell just by looking
you don't even care.

427
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,782
Where were you?

428
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:16,952
Where were you
when someone was killing her?

429
00:25:16,986 --> 00:25:20,555
You should have been there
to protect her.

430
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:22,456
You're right.

431
00:25:22,491 --> 00:25:26,159
<i>- That was your job!
- I know.</i>

432
00:25:26,194 --> 00:25:28,195
I should have been there,

433
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:30,129
and I wish I could
take it all back.

434
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:32,265
I wish...That none of this
had ever happened

435
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:34,433
and your mom was still alive.

436
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:36,635
Wanna know what I wish?

437
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:41,006
That it was just my mom
and me and Cody and Harrison.

438
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,907
'Cause we all would have been
so much better off

439
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:45,110
if she hadn't met you!

440
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:49,113
<i>I wish you were dead!</i>

441
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:14,506
- Do you mind?
- What?

442
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,809
Look somewhere else.

443
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:31,059
What are you doing?

444
00:26:31,093 --> 00:26:34,596
Jesus, Quinn, you can't
grab a sheet or something?

445
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,297
Oh. Sorry.

446
00:26:36,332 --> 00:26:38,633
So...What are you doing?

447
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,101
Trying to find a dress
for Rita.

448
00:26:40,135 --> 00:26:41,535
You gonna bury her
in one of those?

449
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,138
You got something better?

450
00:26:48,677 --> 00:26:50,811
Great. I-I gotta go.

451
00:26:50,845 --> 00:26:53,146
I gotta go home now.

452
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,115
You might wanna
put some pants on there.

453
00:26:57,585 --> 00:26:59,986
You wanna talk about it,
or you just gonna act weird?

454
00:27:00,021 --> 00:27:01,621
There's nothing to talk about.

455
00:27:01,656 --> 00:27:02,989
Okay.

456
00:27:03,024 --> 00:27:05,359
I mean...
You show up here,

457
00:27:05,393 --> 00:27:07,795
which I didn't even
ask you to do, so...

458
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:09,731
Yeah. To help.

459
00:27:09,765 --> 00:27:11,366
Is that what you call it?

460
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:13,836
Morgan.

461
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,504
[Engine turns]

462
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:31,387
Elliot?

463
00:27:31,421 --> 00:27:32,989
That's your name, right?

464
00:27:33,023 --> 00:27:34,390
Yeah.

465
00:27:34,425 --> 00:27:36,393
Hi. Quinn.
Metro homicide.

466
00:27:36,427 --> 00:27:37,694
Hey.

467
00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:39,496
You have kids, I take it.

468
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:42,700
Yeah. They're with
their mother.

469
00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:44,669
Um...We're divorced.

470
00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:46,738
Plus, it just seemed
better for them to get away

471
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:48,340
after what happened next door.

472
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,013
Um...You know, I already
talked to the FBI.

473
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,048
I told them
I didn't see anything.

474
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:57,917
What did you need?

475
00:27:57,951 --> 00:28:00,919
How well did you know Rita?

476
00:28:00,953 --> 00:28:04,055
I don't know, you know.
We were neighbors.

477
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:07,325
Yeah. I just...
Couldn't help but notice

478
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,728
how torn up you were
about her the other night.

479
00:28:12,765 --> 00:28:16,133
She was a friend, you know?
It was upsetting.

480
00:28:16,168 --> 00:28:19,304
A friend.

481
00:28:19,338 --> 00:28:22,740
I, uh, was told
she might have been more.

482
00:28:22,774 --> 00:28:24,108
[Sighs] Christ.

483
00:28:24,143 --> 00:28:26,110
All right, look,
I don't know what you've heard,

484
00:28:26,144 --> 00:28:27,912
but just so you understand
the actual facts,

485
00:28:27,947 --> 00:28:30,248
all Rita and I ever did
was kiss...once.

486
00:28:30,282 --> 00:28:31,816
That was it.
It was nothing.

487
00:28:31,851 --> 00:28:34,752
I mean,
her husband was never around.

488
00:28:34,787 --> 00:28:36,387
Anyway,

489
00:28:36,422 --> 00:28:38,389
Dexter found out about
the indiscretion and, uh,

490
00:28:38,424 --> 00:28:39,991
came over and punched me out.

491
00:28:42,294 --> 00:28:43,928
Hmm.

492
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:51,136
[Door opens]

493
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,704
Dexter.

494
00:28:52,738 --> 00:28:55,273
[Whispers]
Shh! He's sleeping.

495
00:29:00,045 --> 00:29:02,179
Brought some dresses
for you to look at.

496
00:29:08,086 --> 00:29:10,087
Where are Astor and Cody?

497
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:13,057
At a hotel
with their grandparents.

498
00:29:13,091 --> 00:29:15,292
How'd it go talking with them?

499
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,964
Astor's upset.

500
00:29:19,998 --> 00:29:22,166
They got me a hat.

501
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:25,070
She'll be okay.

502
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:26,706
I don't see how.

503
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,908
Her mother's dead
because of me.

504
00:29:28,943 --> 00:29:30,577
No, she's not.

505
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,715
She's dead because of Trinity.

506
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,852
I know you keep blaming
yourself, but you can't.

507
00:29:37,886 --> 00:29:40,088
There's nothing you could
have done differently.

508
00:29:40,122 --> 00:29:42,124
I could have killed
Arthur Mitchell

509
00:29:42,158 --> 00:29:43,925
the first chance I got.

510
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:45,927
You loved Rita.

511
00:29:45,961 --> 00:29:50,832
You never would have let
anything hurt her.

512
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:52,700
She was lucky to have you.

513
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:56,503
She told me that
all the time...

514
00:29:56,538 --> 00:29:59,673
How lucky she felt
to have found you.

515
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,024
I was wondering
what you were doing

516
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:20,826
sitting here by yourself
for so long.

517
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,328
Now I see.

518
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:27,232
I paid her to say that.

519
00:30:27,266 --> 00:30:29,702
You did?

520
00:30:29,736 --> 00:30:32,004
No, I was...Just kidding.

521
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,673
Me too.

522
00:30:36,777 --> 00:30:41,047
So what does a...
Blood spatter analyst do anyway?

523
00:30:43,317 --> 00:30:45,952
'Scuse me.

524
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:03,269
Is this yours?
[alarm chirps]

525
00:31:03,303 --> 00:31:06,239
What's the deal here?

526
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:19,817
I have to go.

527
00:31:19,852 --> 00:31:21,586
Uh, is everything okay?

528
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:24,089
It's a stomach bug.
It's going around the station.

529
00:31:24,123 --> 00:31:25,523
I'm really sorry.

530
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:28,426
It was nice meeting you...

531
00:31:37,835 --> 00:31:39,769
[Whispers] Lucky to have me.

532
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:41,237
I wouldn't say so.

533
00:31:41,271 --> 00:31:45,075
She trusted me,
and now she's dead.

534
00:31:53,483 --> 00:31:56,085
Like your sister says,
I'm toxic.

535
00:31:58,322 --> 00:32:00,556
You'd all be better off
without me.

536
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,285
Delete the past.
Leave nothing behind.

537
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:36,830
You're up early.

538
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:40,667
What are you doing over there
that's so important?

- I-I wasn't completely
honest with you. Um...

720
00:43:37,236 --> 00:43:39,704
You didn't really
get stuck in traffic?

721
00:43:39,738 --> 00:43:42,239
[Laughs]

722
00:43:42,274 --> 00:43:45,642
I have two kids.
Astor and Cody.

723
00:43:45,676 --> 00:43:47,811
They're 9 and 7.

724
00:43:47,845 --> 00:43:50,679
I like kids.

725
00:43:50,713 --> 00:43:53,315
You do?

726
00:43:53,349 --> 00:43:54,683
Yeah, they're fun.

727
00:43:54,717 --> 00:43:57,985
Besides, Deb already told me.

728
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,690
- And my ex-husband
and our...Problems?

729
00:44:01,724 --> 00:44:03,025
Did she tell you?

730
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:04,994
Yeah.

731
00:44:05,028 --> 00:44:08,997
So you know all about me.

732
00:44:09,031 --> 00:44:11,829
I'd like to know more.

733
00:44:11,863 --> 00:44:14,332
[Laughs]

734
00:44:14,366 --> 00:44:15,933
So...

735
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:19,936
So maybe we should
get together again sometime.

736
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:24,608
I would like that.
A lot.

737
00:44:24,642 --> 00:44:26,343
A lot.
[laughs]

738
00:44:26,377 --> 00:44:29,646
I know I should
hang up right now,

739
00:44:29,681 --> 00:44:31,615
but I just need to say it.

740
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:36,220
Um, I don't know
why exactly, but...

741
00:44:36,254 --> 00:44:39,723
You make me feel good.

742
00:44:39,757 --> 00:44:42,392
Like things could be different.

743
00:44:42,426 --> 00:44:45,295
So do you.

744
00:44:45,329 --> 00:44:49,031
Make me feel that way...
Too, I mean.

745
00:44:49,066 --> 00:44:50,766
Glad I called.

746
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,501
I don't know, I felt...

747
00:44:52,535 --> 00:44:55,370
Up in the air
the way things ended.

748
00:44:55,405 --> 00:44:59,707
You know, like we never
said a proper good-bye, so...

749
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:02,142
- Good-bye, Rita Bennett.

750
00:45:02,176 --> 00:45:06,812
- Good-bye, Dexter Morgan.

751
00:45:12,651 --> 00:45:14,785
- Good-bye.

752
00:45:17,155 --> 00:45:19,823
I'm sorry.

753
00:45:23,661 --> 00:45:26,463
[Engine sputters]

754
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:51,187

[Bell dinging]

756

[Pounding on counter]

757
00:45:59,164 --> 00:46:00,864
Where's the key
to the fucking bathroom?

758
00:46:00,898 --> 00:46:04,301
Or should I just dump
out on the floor?

759
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,174
What's your problem?

760
00:46:11,209 --> 00:46:13,477
Nothing.

761
00:46:13,511 --> 00:46:14,945
Fucking retard.

762
00:46:14,979 --> 00:46:16,579
Get the fuck outta here!

763
00:46:16,614 --> 00:46:19,649
He's right.
I should keep moving.

764
00:46:28,892 --> 00:46:30,626
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey.

765
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:34,029
I said...

766
00:46:34,063 --> 00:46:36,031
What the fuck is your problem?

767
00:46:37,566 --> 00:46:39,434
I've had a bad week.

768
00:46:39,468 --> 00:46:42,972
My wife died,
and it was my fault.

769
00:46:43,006 --> 00:46:45,808
Well, I'm real sorry
for your fuckin' loss,

770
00:46:45,843 --> 00:46:48,945
but your dead wife
can suck my dick.

771
00:46:56,754 --> 00:46:58,688
I never meant to hurt her.

772
00:47:11,868 --> 00:47:14,837
[Wet crunching sound]

773
00:47:37,126 --> 00:47:39,695
That's the first human thing
I've seen you do

774
00:47:39,729 --> 00:47:43,198
since she died, Dexter.

775
00:47:43,233 --> 00:47:46,069
I thought you'd left me.

776
00:47:46,103 --> 00:47:48,571
I'm here.

777
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:58,584
It's okay, son...

778
00:47:58,618 --> 00:48:01,620
to show what you're feeling.

779
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:10,031
[Whimpering]

780
00:48:10,065 --> 00:48:13,570

[Screams]

783
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:28,451
They're not better off
without you.

784
00:48:28,485 --> 00:48:31,953
You're not better off
without them.

785
00:48:31,988 --> 00:48:34,789
You need to go back.

786
00:48:52,341 --> 00:48:54,942
Deb says
she's sure he'll be here.

787
00:48:54,976 --> 00:48:56,944
Better be.
If we don't get going soon,

788
00:48:56,978 --> 00:49:00,815
we'll be burying Rita
by candlelight.

789
00:49:05,721 --> 00:49:07,455
So you're not...
Talking to me now?

790
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:09,958
Is that it?

791
00:49:09,993 --> 00:49:12,562
I have been
trying to talk to you.

792
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:18,368
You're right. You have.

793
00:49:20,604 --> 00:49:23,272
I just need you
to understand...

794
00:49:23,307 --> 00:49:24,606
So tell me.

795
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:27,275
I could have fought
for this case, but...

796
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,711
Part of me didn't want to.

797
00:49:31,547 --> 00:49:35,549
Rita...died.

798
00:49:37,118 --> 00:49:41,488
She died, and it scared me.

799
00:49:41,523 --> 00:49:44,024
We've been married, what,
ten hours?

800
00:49:45,927 --> 00:49:47,727
Dexter was the witness
at our ceremony.

801
00:49:47,762 --> 00:49:48,995
For all I know,

802
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:51,564
he was there with us
while she was...

803
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,200
Being...
I know.

804
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:59,538
Well, I didn't want to be
reminded of that.

805
00:49:59,573 --> 00:50:03,109
I didn't want to investigate.

806
00:50:03,143 --> 00:50:04,744
I just wanted...

807
00:50:04,778 --> 00:50:07,680
I just wanted it to be
our wedding day.

808
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:10,015
Oh...

809
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:12,217
I don't like it, Angel.

810
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:14,018
I don't like the way
this makes me feel.

811
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,487
I don't know what to do
with any of it.

812
00:50:15,521 --> 00:50:17,021
- Maria.
- [sobs]

813
00:50:18,957 --> 00:50:21,526
What?

814
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,929
No one does.

815
00:50:32,073 --> 00:50:36,043
What's more important
than his own wife's funeral?

816
00:50:36,077 --> 00:50:38,446
People are getting restless.

817
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,916
Thank you for reporting in
with the obvious, Quinn.

818
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:46,687
Like I'm such a moron
that it's lost on me.

819
00:50:46,722 --> 00:50:48,956
You ever given a eulogy?

820
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:50,457
No.

821
00:50:50,492 --> 00:50:52,059
Well, I can't do it.

822
00:50:52,093 --> 00:50:54,361
And those agents,
those vultures

823
00:50:54,396 --> 00:50:56,363
are just waiting for him.

824
00:50:56,397 --> 00:50:57,698
Look...

825
00:50:57,732 --> 00:51:00,434
There's something
you should probably know.

826
00:51:00,468 --> 00:51:02,703
What?

827
00:51:02,738 --> 00:51:05,073
It's not exactly
an easy thing to say.

828
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:08,644
The next-door neighbor Elliot,
I spoke to him the other day.

829
00:51:08,678 --> 00:51:12,348
- What the fuck?
- I know I shouldn't have...

830
00:51:48,017 --> 00:51:51,152
She had a big heart.

831
00:51:53,522 --> 00:51:57,425
Big enough for both of us.

832
00:51:57,459 --> 00:52:00,328
Had to be.

833
00:52:00,363 --> 00:52:06,167
I wasn't even human...

834
00:52:06,202 --> 00:52:08,536
When we first met.

835
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:13,007
I never expected that
to change.

836
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:14,742
She reached out
and found something

837
00:52:14,776 --> 00:52:17,445
I didn't even know was there.

838
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,882
She never hurt anybody.

839
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:23,351
She was innocent.

840
00:52:26,555 --> 00:52:28,790
And she died a brutal death
and...

841
00:52:28,824 --> 00:52:34,329
And I can't...

842
00:52:34,363 --> 00:52:36,297
Fix it.

843
00:52:43,573 --> 00:52:46,909
But I know I have to try...

844
00:52:50,514 --> 00:52:53,482
Here in Miami with the people
who knew her

845
00:52:53,517 --> 00:52:55,718
and who... who...

846
00:52:58,422 --> 00:53:00,990
Who cared about her.

847
00:53:02,959 --> 00:53:06,396
And who loved her.

848
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:14,471
Like I did.
