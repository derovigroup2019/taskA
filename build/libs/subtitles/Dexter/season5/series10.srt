1
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:48,197
<i>Previously on "Dexter"...</i>

2
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:50,428
<i>I need to get my hands on that vial.</i>

3
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:52,403
I'm just gonna extract a sample.

4
00:01:52,798 --> 00:01:54,905
I'll run it for DNA. Hopefully get an I.D.

5
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:56,760
So whose blood do you think it is?

6
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,762
Your blood results are in.

7
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,537
<i>Emily Birch. She's not a victim. She's alive.</i>

8
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,789
<i>Boozing it up in Coral Gables.</i>

9
00:02:04,176 --> 00:02:05,435
The barrel girls case,...

10
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,043
there are partial sequences
from multiple people.

11
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:09,963
Cole and Boyd did this together?

12
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:12,548
With maybe three or four others.

13
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:14,435
As far as Quinn goes,...

14
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:16,719
he wasn't on vacation, I suspended him.

15
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,721
To protect your brother.

16
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:20,621
I trusted you.

17
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:24,602
And while you were fucking me, you were
spreading shit about my brother behind my back.

18
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:26,812
Fuck you.

19
00:02:28,798 --> 00:02:30,649
<i>Cole as a teenager.</i>

20
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:40,637
Your boy Dexter Morgan and his girlfriend
on his boat at 3:00 A.M.

21
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,514
- What's in the bags?
- Something heavy.

22
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,455
I'm thinking narcotics. Maybe a body.

23
00:02:44,912 --> 00:02:46,259
It's time to stop.

24
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:48,523
Stay the fuck away from Deb!

25
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:51,813
<i>- Dexter?
- No, it's Jordan Chase.</i>

26
00:02:52,063 --> 00:02:53,513
<i>Can I leave a message?</i>

27
00:02:53,763 --> 00:02:55,814
Tick, tick, tick.

28
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:59,778
That's the sound of his life running out.

29
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:02,628
Take care, Lumen.

30
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:15,730
<i>They say that history repeats itself,...</i>

31
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,632
<i>but I will never put my family in danger again.</i>

32
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:23,682
<i>Now that Jordan Chase knows Lumen and I
are on to him, I need to plan for the worst.</i>

33
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:27,402
Yeah, I think that's the last of it.

34
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:30,431
I put the grandparents' address
in the navigational system.

35
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:32,343
And I have the print-out you gave me.

36
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:37,299
And Harrison is going to have such a good time
with his big sister and big brother in Orlando.

37
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,931
<i>I'm getting Harrison out of Miami
and Lumen out of that house.</i>

38
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:44,458
Dexter.

39
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,969
I haven't been apart from him since Rita died.

40
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:51,064
Nothing is going to happen to Harrison.

41
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,562
Love you.

42
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,475
Call me as soon as you get there.

43
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:05,286
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Dexter.

44
00:04:14,603 --> 00:04:15,604
Lumen.

45
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:19,488
Come on.

46
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:24,987
We'll be safe here. Jordan doesn't know
about this place. He thinks we're at the house.

47
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:35,704
What the fuck are you up to now?

48
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:44,661
We can't wait any more.
We need to take out Jordan.

49
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,346
That might be difficult.

50
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,140
He's surrounded at all times
by four bodyguards.

51
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,666
Except when he's on stage in front of 200 people.
I think we should start with the others.

52
00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:56,813
- We don't even know who they are.
- No. But she can help us.

53
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:00,867
Is that her? The one whose blood
Jordan wears around his neck?

54
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:03,806
- Yeah. Emily Birch.
- She looks like me...

55
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:05,398
and the girls in the barrels.

56
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:07,017
But older.

57
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:11,146
She's the same age as Jordan,
and Cole, and Boyd.

58
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:14,576
I think she was the first victim.

59
00:05:14,826 --> 00:05:16,597
How is she still alive?

60
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:18,628
I don't know. I hope she can tell us.

61
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:20,429
We're gonna talk to her today?

62
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:23,405
I'll come back at lunchtime. We'll go then.

63
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:29,481
Stay inside. Don't open the door.

64
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,140
I won't.

65
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:33,136
To anyone.

66
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:45,194
Okay, by now you're all aware
that new evidence has been found

67
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:48,827
in the barrel girls case,
which this department is again pursuing

68
00:05:49,077 --> 00:05:50,901
as a top priority.

69
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:55,047
Our initial conclusion that Boyd Fowler
was solely responsible for these crimes was wrong.

70
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,670
It now appears that he had help.

71
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,585
<i>And the day began with such promise.</i>

72
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,985
Vince, can you take us through the DNA?

73
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,422
New evidence "has been found"?

74
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:07,658
Like, maybe the evidence discovered itself.

75
00:06:08,122 --> 00:06:10,315
I'm just glad to be back.
It beats the fucking file room.

76
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:13,459
DNA reports from the coroner's office
point to multiple perps.

77
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:14,790
- Do we have any names?
- No.

78
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,104
What we have are partial sequences
from very seriously degraded DNA.

79
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,925
But the evidence confirms
what we knew about Boyd Fowler.

80
00:06:21,175 --> 00:06:25,354
And it also points with a high probability
to Cole Harmon, Jordan Chase's head of security.

81
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:28,571
As you know, Cole Harmon
was our original suspect in the case.

82
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,322
<i>Until I pointed them toward Boyd Fowler.</i>

83
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:32,237
He is now our main target again.

84
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:35,444
<i>A target you'll never hit.
He's already buried at sea.</i>

85
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:36,831
- Morgan.
- Yeah.

86
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:37,899
- Yeah.
- Debra.

87
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:41,279
Take Quinn and bring in Cole Harmon.
Start at his office.

88
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:45,134
In the meantime, I'm getting search warrants for
his house. You should have them within the hour.

89
00:06:45,384 --> 00:06:47,781
- Fuck yeah.
- That's it.

90
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:53,434
Hey, congrats.
Looks like your filing days are over.

91
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:56,934
Yeah, at least until Laguerta's mood changes.

92
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:02,718
Angel.

93
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:09,047
- So you got Morgan back.
- Yeah. Thanks for that.

94
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:11,332
It's what you wanted.

95
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:13,904
She earned it.

96
00:07:14,154 --> 00:07:16,904
- So...
- I'll keep you posted on the case.

97
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:33,322
May I help you?

98
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:36,522
Miami Metro Homicide.
We're looking for Cole Harmon.

99
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:41,617
Mr. Harmon hasn't worked here
in more than two weeks.

100
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:43,551
What?

101
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:46,257
You should probably talk to Mr. Chase.

102
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:48,097
Are you fucking kidding me?

103
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:51,182
Your head of security disappears
and you don't think it's worth reporting?

104
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:52,541
It seemed like an internal matter.

105
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,267
Cole Harmon is wanted for the rape
and murder of at least five women.

106
00:07:56,608 --> 00:08:01,230
Hold on a second. Detective Batista told me
and Mr. Harmon that you'd made a mistake,...

107
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:04,210
that some animal pickup officer
was your sole suspect.

108
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,860
He's not anymore.

109
00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:07,955
And I was supposed to divine that somehow?

110
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:08,988
Do you know where he is or not?

111
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:11,783
Detective Morgan, I don't know
where this aggression is coming from

112
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,916
or why it's directed at me.
But a word of caution:

113
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,247
Aggression can be a powerful motivator,
but it can also cloud your percep...

114
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:21,625
Save your bullshit for your seminars
and answer my question.

115
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:23,637
I have no idea where Cole is.

116
00:08:23,887 --> 00:08:25,281
He told me he needed some personal time.

117
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:29,152
Your head of security says he needs some time off
and you just say "okay"?

118
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:31,637
I have been nothing but cooperative
with your department.

119
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,722
But that was predicated on a certain amount
of discretion on your part.

120
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:35,973
And respect.

121
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,284
Now you barge into my place of business,
hurling insinuations.

122
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,484
No one is insinuating anything.

123
00:08:41,993 --> 00:08:44,043
Look, if you hear from Cole,...

124
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,480
give us a call, okay?

125
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,153
From now on, any contact between us
will be through my attorney.

126
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:50,864
He'll be hearing from us.

127
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,801
Is there some reason you needed
to antagonize him like that?

128
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,159
Yes.

129
00:08:57,477 --> 00:08:59,955
Girls are being raped, tortured,
and stuffed into barrels.

130
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:02,791
Two rapist-killers are directly connected to him.

131
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,276
What are the odds he knows
absolutely nothing about it?

132
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:06,962
- Small.
- Yes.

133
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,052
Small, Quinn. That was my point.

134
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:11,602
I understand that. I'm on your side, okay?

135
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:20,878
The search warrants have probably come through.
Let's go fuck up Cole Harmon's living room.

136
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,718
Emily Birch?

137
00:09:38,046 --> 00:09:39,046
Yes?

138
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:40,748
Who are you?

139
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:44,155
We're trying to track down
some information on Jordan Chase.

140
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:46,206
The Jordan Chase?

141
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:48,660
We understand that you know him.

142
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,310
Do I look like the kind of person
that knows Jordan Chase?

143
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:52,560
Well,...

144
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,320
he knows who you are.

145
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,620
- How?
- Do you mind if I show you a photo?

146
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:04,311
- I think you need to go.
- Maybe you know some of these people.

147
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:06,372
- No.
- Could you at least just look at it?

148
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:09,317
I told you I don't know
who any of those people are and I want you to go.

149
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:10,890
Emily.

150
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,613
That went well.

151
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,777
Did you see how she reacted to that photo?
She definitely knows who they are.

152
00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:24,562
You'd think she'd want to talk to us.

153
00:10:24,812 --> 00:10:25,763
I don't know.

154
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:28,237
Security bars, DUIs.

155
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:30,967
She's got a lot of defenses in place.

156
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:34,301
There's got to be a way to get her
to give us those names.

157
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,702
Deb needs me on a search warrant.

158
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:41,013
At Cole Harmon's house.

159
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,019
I'll drop you back at the apartment first.

160
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:02,509
I don't see any blood.

161
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,970
You think we'd call you here for nothing?

162
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:11,036
Kid gloves, okay? That's gonna tell us
which scumbag friends he's been talking to.

163
00:11:11,286 --> 00:11:15,756
Unless there's such a thing as red mold,
this sure as shit looks like blood.

164
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:20,556
<i>Cole Harmon's blood.
Left there when Lumen hit him to save me.</i>

165
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,639
It's definitely blood.

166
00:11:28,926 --> 00:11:31,308
- Blood that's been cleaned up.
- You don't miss a thing.

167
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,558
<i>Unfortunately.</i>

168
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:35,945
There's something fucked up
about this whole situation.

169
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,985
Cole's car is still in the driveway.

170
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:42,435
It's not like he got up and ran.
It's like he disappeared, or he got disappeared.

171
00:11:42,763 --> 00:11:43,889
Rush that blood work, okay?

172
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:47,167
I want to know if it's Cole's
and if someone did a number on him.

173
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:48,417
Deb.

174
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:51,618
Deb, you got to take a look at this.

175
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:16,886
- DVDs. They were in that lockbox.
- No! No! No!

176
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:24,118
They videotaped themselves torturing these women.

177
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:28,290
13 disks. They're all numbered.

178
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,890
<i>Lumen was the last victim.
That would make her number 13.</i>

179
00:12:32,302 --> 00:12:33,352
Turn it off.

180
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,110
<i>Despite having considered myself a monster
for as long as I can remember,...</i>

181
00:12:59,469 --> 00:13:00,903
<i>it still comes as a shock</i>

182
00:13:01,153 --> 00:13:05,153
<i>when I'm confronted with the depth of evil
that exists in this world.</i>

183
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,709
Did the blood work go out?

184
00:13:13,307 --> 00:13:14,460
An hour ago.

185
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,710
And?

186
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:19,066
Deb, the results won't come back
for at least a day.

187
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:20,826
But you'll let me know?

188
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:24,453
Right.

189
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:30,034
I need to take a breath, you know?

190
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,897
It's hard. There is some seriously
fucked up shit in there.

191
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,241
<i>And if Debra gets eyes on Lumen's DVD,
she'll know everything.</i>

192
00:13:37,491 --> 00:13:38,787
<i>It will all unravel.</i>

193
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,037
Deb.

194
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:44,156
Cole Harmon's emails and phone records are up.
You want to go through them?

195
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,706
Fuck yes. Let's see who he's been talking to.

196
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:10,505
No, no, no, no.
Chain of custody. Chain of custody.

197
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:13,044
Your sister's new mantra.

198
00:14:13,346 --> 00:14:15,643
Last time someone came in here,
she nearly killed me,

199
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:19,553
which, frankly, would be better than
going through another one of these DVDs.

200
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:22,653
Each one, same creepy place.

201
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:26,481
Same creepy shit.

202
00:14:28,596 --> 00:14:30,346
Notice anything about them?

203
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,270
<i>They all look like Lumen.</i>

204
00:14:33,813 --> 00:14:35,113
No, not really.

205
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
Well,...

206
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:40,964
they could be sisters. All 13 of them.

207
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,364
Which is weird.

208
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,155
- I mean, 13.
- Why?

209
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:49,336
You were at Boyd Fowler's house
when we went through it, right?

210
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,080
Yep.

211
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:54,379
Remember those locks of hair?

212
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:58,239
There were 12. So there should be 12 victims.

213
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,091
But there are 13 disks.

214
00:15:02,147 --> 00:15:03,231
<i>He's nearly there.</i>

215
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:04,481
Yeah.

216
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:06,631
That is weird.

217
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:10,590
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Dex! Whoa! Back back back!

218
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,744
- Dude!
- Sorry.

219
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,695
You've got to be more careful, man!
This is all we got to nail these fucking assholes,

220
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:18,095
- this right here!
- I know. I'm sorry.

221
00:15:18,465 --> 00:15:20,211
I'll just... I'll leave.

222
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:27,703
I've been trying to get a handle
on this Emily Birch and there's nothing.

223
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:31,587
She graduates high school in 1992
and then it's just a big blank.

224
00:15:31,837 --> 00:15:35,687
Except for those DUIs that you found.

225
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:39,097
What?

226
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:43,520
They found this...

227
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,670
in the search at Cole's.

228
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:51,682
The men who hurt you,
they made DVDs of everything they did.

229
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,490
13?

230
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,695
Is that me?

231
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:12,624
- Did everyone watch it?
- No.

232
00:16:13,832 --> 00:16:16,732
I managed to get it out of evidence in time.

233
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:18,419
Did you...

234
00:16:20,254 --> 00:16:21,504
Did you watch it?

235
00:16:21,836 --> 00:16:25,536
Only enough to make sure I had the right one.

236
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,102
Are you sure you want to keep it?

237
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:31,794
Number 13.

238
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:35,287
That's what I was to them.

239
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,250
It must've been hard for you to get that.

240
00:16:56,551 --> 00:16:58,251
I know that you risk your life...

241
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:01,124
every day that you're with me.

242
00:17:02,678 --> 00:17:06,028
You've been my only way through this.

243
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:11,505
Well, I guess...

244
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,460
we both met each other at the right time.

245
00:17:30,053 --> 00:17:33,396
<i>No! No! Let me out of here! No!</i>

246
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:36,102
<i>No! No! No!</i>

247
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:37,868
<i>No! Let me go!</i>

248
00:17:38,118 --> 00:17:41,056
<i>No! No!</i>

249
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:44,292
<i>No! No!</i>

250
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:47,749
<i>Get me out of here! No! No! No!</i>

251
00:17:58,641 --> 00:17:59,855
<i>The DVDs.</i>

252
00:18:00,276 --> 00:18:01,623
<i>Lumen watching at home.</i>

253
00:18:02,201 --> 00:18:03,701
<i>Deb watching here.</i>

254
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,240
<i>Both wanting some sort of resolution.</i>

255
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,860
<i>But I can only help one.</i>

256
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:20,062
Watching these DVDs,
watching it actually happen...

257
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:22,686
is worse than any fucking crime scene.

258
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:25,404
What these women went through,...

259
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:28,315
I don't know, maybe it's a fucking blessing
that they're dead.

260
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:32,709
No one could go through something like this
and have a life again.

261
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:44,721
People may be stronger than you think.

262
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:47,171
Believe me, on this one, you're wrong.

263
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,540
There's no coming back
from something like this.

264
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:55,813
Where's 13?

265
00:18:56,063 --> 00:18:58,304
Disk 13, it was damaged.

266
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,360
I was actually grateful I didn't have to watch
another one of these.

267
00:19:05,285 --> 00:19:06,645
Have you been here all night?

268
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:10,567
Yeah. And I think it was worth it
'cause I think I'm starting to figure it out.

269
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:14,587
I went through Cole Harmon's contacts and...

270
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,869
do you remember that weird
plastic-wrap murder a few weeks back?

271
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:22,624
Those two guys at the warehouse.

272
00:19:22,949 --> 00:19:24,972
Yeah, one of them was a dentist.

273
00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:26,473
A kids' dentist.

274
00:19:26,723 --> 00:19:27,823
Dan Mendell.

275
00:19:28,546 --> 00:19:31,570
Well, it turns out he and Cole are buddies.

276
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,670
They fucking poke each other on Facebook.

277
00:19:35,156 --> 00:19:37,676
And you see that ring on the DVD?

278
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:42,666
It matches photos
taken at the warehouse crime scene.

279
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,416
So I think he's one of these guys.

280
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:48,813
So Dan the dentist is dead.
He was shot to death.

281
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:52,320
Looks like somebody attacked
Cole Harmon in his house.

282
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,485
And Boyd Fowler's disappeared.

283
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:59,876
This is a group of guys that like to get together
and they like to do this for fun.

284
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:01,973
So what else do they have in common?

285
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,452
They're all missing.

286
00:20:03,762 --> 00:20:05,319
They're not on the run. I can tell you that.

287
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:07,916
Not one of them bought a plane ticket,
or emptied their bank account,

288
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,716
or used a fucking credit card.

289
00:20:10,972 --> 00:20:13,233
Someone is taking these guys out.

290
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:15,794
Who?

291
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:19,671
Well, at first I thought
they were turning on each other.

292
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:24,107
But then I thought: "That doesn't make any sense.
Why would they do that after all this time?"

293
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,507
So I started asking myself:

294
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:29,589
"Who would want to take these guys out?"

295
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,721
And you know the first person
that came to mind?

296
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:36,652
Me.

297
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,003
You?

298
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:43,291
Someone who knows
what these cocksuckers have been up to...

299
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:46,725
and wants to give them what they deserve.

300
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:50,124
So what are you saying?
There's a vigilante out there?

301
00:20:50,513 --> 00:20:52,793
Yeah, I think that's what I'm saying. Yes.

302
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:02,865
This is what happened to me.

303
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:08,739
Is it also what happened to you?

304
00:21:12,978 --> 00:21:15,078
There were 13 of us after you.

305
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:18,183
I didn't know.

306
00:21:19,907 --> 00:21:24,199
I didn't know there was anybody else
until you knocked on my door.

307
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,401
I'm the only one who survived.

308
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:28,280
Oh, my God.

309
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:31,574
Emily,...

310
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:36,644
I need you to tell me
what happened to you.

311
00:21:38,084 --> 00:21:39,160
Can you do that?

312
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:41,627
Yeah...

313
00:21:45,943 --> 00:21:49,474
It was almost 20 years ago
during the summer...

314
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:51,139
at camp.

315
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:53,837
I was a C.I.T.,

316
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,050
counselor in training,

317
00:21:58,058 --> 00:22:00,337
a year older than them.

318
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:03,605
They were just...

319
00:22:05,994 --> 00:22:07,494
like everybody else.

320
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:11,429
Except Jordan.

321
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,450
Only, he wasn't called Jordan then.

322
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:17,671
He was Eugene Greer.

323
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:22,238
That's Jordan Chase?

324
00:22:24,596 --> 00:22:26,595
When he was Eugene Greer.

325
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:28,895
I felt sorry for him.

326
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:31,245
Became his friend, you know.

327
00:22:31,699 --> 00:22:34,209
We would take these walks. And one day,...

328
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:38,543
we were walking and I blacked out.

329
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:41,777
He must have drugged me or something.

330
00:22:42,248 --> 00:22:44,098
They drugged me too.

331
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,684
I woke up in a cabin.

332
00:22:48,146 --> 00:22:50,107
My clothes were off.

333
00:22:50,425 --> 00:22:53,252
And I was tied to a bunk.

334
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:58,849
Eugene started in...

335
00:22:59,974 --> 00:23:03,349
- So he attacked you.
- No.

336
00:23:03,638 --> 00:23:06,291
Eugene never touched me.

337
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:10,157
But he got those guys going.
He talked them into it.

338
00:23:10,865 --> 00:23:13,659
Told them to seize their desires.

339
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:15,099
And...

340
00:23:17,301 --> 00:23:19,061
they did.

341
00:23:19,435 --> 00:23:22,003
And I was watching Gene's face.

342
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,915
The look that came over his face,...

343
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:28,493
it was just a flash.

344
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:33,714
But it's the same look
he has all the time now.

345
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:39,205
And I got dressed. And they made me...

346
00:23:41,281 --> 00:23:43,813
take their picture.

347
00:23:44,063 --> 00:23:45,974
This photo.

348
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:50,013
So this is Cole.

349
00:23:50,438 --> 00:23:51,738
And that's Dan.

350
00:23:52,652 --> 00:23:54,311
And that's Boyd.

351
00:23:56,022 --> 00:23:57,599
And Jordan.

352
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:01,592
Who is this one?

353
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:05,676
Alex.

354
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:10,522
Alex Tilden. He's the fifth.

355
00:24:19,949 --> 00:24:21,603
Can I help you?

356
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,880
Yeah. You got a pen?

357
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,084
Sure.

358
00:24:28,141 --> 00:24:31,891
Just leaving a note for Joey.
I'm an old friend.

359
00:24:32,274 --> 00:24:33,603
Thank you.

360
00:24:35,882 --> 00:24:37,296
You're...

361
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:39,681
You're Harry's kid, right? Blood guy.

362
00:24:39,931 --> 00:24:43,988
- That's right.
- And your sister, Detective Morgan...

363
00:24:45,171 --> 00:24:48,488
Usually it's the boy child ends up
doing the police work, not the girl.

364
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,443
But here you are in the geek squad.

365
00:24:51,693 --> 00:24:53,521
Yeah. Blood spatter suited me more.

366
00:24:53,771 --> 00:24:57,330
- You like the blood, huh?
- I like catching bad guys.

367
00:24:58,488 --> 00:24:59,791
That's cute.

368
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:06,478
Dexter.

369
00:25:07,258 --> 00:25:08,844
Yeah, I'll be right down.

370
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:12,853
- Got to go.
- So long,...

371
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:14,901
Dexter.

372
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,384
Hey, beautiful.

373
00:25:32,634 --> 00:25:35,034
I got to pick up a few things
for a stake-out.

374
00:25:35,422 --> 00:25:37,403
It's for Detective Quinn.
You see his name there.

375
00:25:37,653 --> 00:25:40,165
Let's see. Surveillance cameras, wireless mics,

376
00:25:40,717 --> 00:25:43,086
and a portable wireless recorder monitor.

377
00:25:43,336 --> 00:25:45,163
- Yep.
- Be right back.

378
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:47,220
Thank you.

379
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:54,118
- So Emily never told anyone.
- She said she was afraid of her father.

380
00:25:54,368 --> 00:25:56,628
He hated her friends.
He hated the way she dressed.

381
00:25:56,878 --> 00:25:59,094
She was afraid he would blame her.

382
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:01,544
That's probably the reason
Jordan let her live.

383
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:03,919
Listening to her talk, I could just see it.

384
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:07,429
Jordan's whole philosophy.
Transforming your life. Blah, blah, blah.

385
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,105
It all came from destroying hers.

386
00:26:10,355 --> 00:26:12,381
That moment turned Jordan into a monster.

387
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:15,083
My guess, he already was a monster.

388
00:26:17,131 --> 00:26:19,602
You weren't supposed to go see her alone.
You were supposed to stay in the apartment.

389
00:26:19,852 --> 00:26:23,102
- I tried. I couldn't.
- It's not safe.

390
00:26:23,644 --> 00:26:26,246
You understand that, right?

391
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:35,910
Did Emily name the other one in the photo?

392
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,804
Yes.

393
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,122
What?

394
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:48,515
I want to be the one to do this.

395
00:26:50,564 --> 00:26:52,859
It's one thing to watch it.
It's another thing to actually do it.

396
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:55,492
- I know.
- It will change you.

397
00:26:55,742 --> 00:26:57,458
I'm already changed.

398
00:27:08,189 --> 00:27:10,583
What's the last guy's name?

399
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:15,352
- I'm Alex Tilden. How can I help you?
- Detective Quinn.

400
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:17,544
Morgan. Metro Homicide.

401
00:27:17,794 --> 00:27:20,939
Homicide? Okay. What's going on?

402
00:27:21,487 --> 00:27:24,597
We're investigating a recent series of murders.
You may have read about it.

403
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:27,391
A number of girls were killed
and stored in barrels.

404
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:30,819
Yeah. Yeah, I saw it on the news.
It's pretty shocking.

405
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:32,295
What does it have to do with me?

406
00:27:32,545 --> 00:27:35,006
Cole Harmon is a suspect in our case.

407
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:39,064
Your name turned up on a list of acquaintances.
We're talking to everyone on the list.

408
00:27:39,314 --> 00:27:41,525
Yeah. Well, sure. Yeah, I know Cole.

409
00:27:41,775 --> 00:27:46,265
- You two talk on the phone a lot?
- We're in a fantasy football league together.

410
00:27:46,814 --> 00:27:49,278
I was trying to get him
to give up a player all season.

411
00:27:49,528 --> 00:27:51,824
- Have you heard from him lately?
- No, no.

412
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:53,661
What's going on here?

413
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:56,621
Do you know any of Cole's friends?

414
00:27:57,887 --> 00:28:00,245
Dan Mendell? He's a kids' dentist.

415
00:28:00,495 --> 00:28:02,056
- I don't have kids.
- Do you know him?

416
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:03,416
No.

417
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:05,799
Boyd Fowler. That name ring a bell?

418
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:08,702
No. I don't know either of those men.

419
00:28:10,491 --> 00:28:12,971
You want to tell me
what this is all about?

420
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:16,827
Then, unless I'm in some sort of trouble,
I need to get back to work.

421
00:28:17,077 --> 00:28:19,597
I have a closing in 15 minutes
I should prepare for.

422
00:28:19,847 --> 00:28:22,548
One more name. Jordan Chase.

423
00:28:23,232 --> 00:28:25,336
Jordan Chase, Jordan Chase?

424
00:28:25,586 --> 00:28:27,769
- He's messed up in this?
- Do you know him?

425
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:31,335
I never met him. You know,
I've always wanted to.

426
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:35,557
Well, if you do hear from Cole,

427
00:28:35,807 --> 00:28:38,238
- give us a call, okay?
- I'll do that.

428
00:28:38,603 --> 00:28:39,923
Thank you.

429
00:28:46,216 --> 00:28:48,669
"If you do hear from Cole,
give us a call?"

430
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:52,298
Might be hard for him to get cell reception
from six feet underground.

431
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:56,871
You really think a vigilante's
killing off these people one by one?

432
00:28:57,121 --> 00:29:01,535
Anyone who knows what these guys were up to
would probably do something pretty extreme.

433
00:29:01,785 --> 00:29:04,229
Watch the tapes again. You'll get it.

434
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:11,042
I'm not dressed right.

435
00:29:11,348 --> 00:29:12,819
No, you're fine.

436
00:29:13,342 --> 00:29:15,680
But I did get you something.

437
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:27,632
They're just like yours.

438
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:32,063
Try them on.

439
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,781
From now on, we have to be especially careful
not to leave anything behind.

440
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:51,527
No fingerprints, no evidence.

441
00:29:51,777 --> 00:29:53,709
<i>Nothing that points back to us.</i>

442
00:29:55,996 --> 00:29:58,679
<i>You sure we have enough time to get it all done?</i>

443
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:00,885
<i>Yes, if we move now.</i>

444
00:30:01,762 --> 00:30:06,462
<i>His bank closes at 7:00. We have to be in
and out of his house before he gets back.</i>

445
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,155
<i>I'm used to hunting on my own...</i>

446
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,023
<i>and here we are,...</i>

447
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:31,567
<i>hunting as a pair.</i>

448
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:37,043
Looks like Alex believes in karma.

449
00:30:45,198 --> 00:30:47,307
<i>And it's all become so...</i>

450
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:49,390
<i>natural.</i>

451
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:03,580
- Should we take it?
- No. He'll know someone was here.

452
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,635
This is just a fact-finding mission.

453
00:31:06,885 --> 00:31:09,351
I think we know what the facts are.

454
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,872
There's a way to do this.

455
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:13,972
It protects you.

456
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:16,889
It protects both of us.

457
00:31:22,161 --> 00:31:25,181
One of these days,
you've got to teach me how to do that.

458
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,494
13 pieces of jewelry. 13 trophies.

459
00:31:41,127 --> 00:31:44,641
My grandparents gave me this
when I graduated from high school.

460
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,840
I was wearing it the night they took me.

461
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,374
This is mine.

462
00:31:49,892 --> 00:31:51,242
Let me.

463
00:32:02,772 --> 00:32:03,922
How do you...

464
00:32:04,473 --> 00:32:06,722
choose the...
What do you call it, the place?

465
00:32:06,972 --> 00:32:08,565
Kill room.

466
00:32:11,627 --> 00:32:15,359
We need someplace inconspicuous and secure.

467
00:32:19,315 --> 00:32:20,614
Like this?

468
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:28,365
<i>Maybe it's true
that pairs survive better in the wild.</i>

469
00:32:34,106 --> 00:32:36,706
It's not easy talking to a stranger.

470
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:39,927
But I did it anyway.

471
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:42,702
For you.

472
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:45,766
You told her everything,

473
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,377
about what happened at the camp?

474
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:50,121
It was hard, but...

475
00:32:51,361 --> 00:32:52,361
yeah.

476
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,000
You told her about Alex?

477
00:32:57,882 --> 00:32:59,632
I told her the truth,

478
00:33:00,197 --> 00:33:01,480
like you said.

479
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,090
Even though I didn't want to.

480
00:33:08,623 --> 00:33:10,115
Are you in trouble, Jordan?

481
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,233
The girl you talked to...

482
00:33:17,483 --> 00:33:19,148
was making waves.

483
00:33:22,462 --> 00:33:24,312
But everything's fine now.

484
00:33:25,329 --> 00:33:26,463
Thanks to you.

485
00:33:27,907 --> 00:33:28,962
She was pretty.

486
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,300
The girl.

487
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:33,034
Emily.

488
00:33:35,187 --> 00:33:38,267
No one could ever take your place.
You know that, right?

489
00:33:41,078 --> 00:33:42,578
We have a bond...

490
00:33:44,411 --> 00:33:46,511
that no one can ever break.

491
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:52,298
You made me what I am today.

492
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,064
Do you know how special you are to me?

493
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:37,677
<i>Eugene Greer has arrived.</i>

494
00:34:39,334 --> 00:34:40,904
The parade's here.

495
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,449
Four bodyguards? That's it?

496
00:34:49,738 --> 00:34:52,012
Detectives, I'd like you to meet
my friend and attorney,

497
00:34:52,262 --> 00:34:54,162
- Stuart Frank.
- How do you do?

498
00:34:54,437 --> 00:34:56,939
You've requested a DNA sample from my client.

499
00:34:57,189 --> 00:34:58,532
I'd like to know why.

500
00:34:58,782 --> 00:35:02,211
There was unidentified male DNA
found on the barrel girl victims.

501
00:35:02,461 --> 00:35:04,283
We want to clear Mr. Chase as a suspect.

502
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:06,206
Why on earth is he even considered a suspect?

503
00:35:06,482 --> 00:35:10,621
Because the DNA we have identified
belongs to men directly connected to your client.

504
00:35:10,871 --> 00:35:12,319
Cole Harmon is your head of security.

505
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:16,432
Boyd Fowler is a devoted fan.
We found your books and tapes in his home.

506
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:18,540
That proves exactly nothing.

507
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,956
A million people have connections with my client.

508
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:23,759
I assume the two men
you're talking about drive cars.

509
00:35:24,009 --> 00:35:26,603
Are you going to start
interrogating automobile CEOs?

510
00:35:27,086 --> 00:35:29,795
Detective Morgan,
I've helped a lot of people over the years.

511
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:31,870
Many of them were broken individuals

512
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,297
going through very difficult
periods in their lives.

513
00:35:34,547 --> 00:35:36,142
Is that what you call this?

514
00:35:36,392 --> 00:35:40,692
Someone who's going through
"a very difficult period" in their life?

515
00:35:42,023 --> 00:35:45,713
If Mr. Chase knew anything about this,
he would have informed the police.

516
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,285
Now, unless you're working your way
toward some more reasonable line of inquiry,

517
00:35:49,535 --> 00:35:52,326
- we're done here. Jordan.
- No, we're not.

518
00:35:52,576 --> 00:35:55,744
I want to do anything I can to help you
find the people who did that.

519
00:35:55,994 --> 00:35:58,067
- If you wanna take my DNA, you're welcome to it.
- Jordan!

520
00:35:58,317 --> 00:35:59,667
It's okay, Stu.

521
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:02,650
I know it's your duty to be suspicious.

522
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,926
But I swear, no one is more disturbed than I am

523
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:08,667
that people I've helped could be
responsible for something like this.

524
00:36:09,164 --> 00:36:10,551
So how does this work?

525
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,231
It's just a cheek swab.
It won't take but a second.

526
00:36:13,481 --> 00:36:14,545
You don't have to do this.

527
00:36:14,795 --> 00:36:16,354
Dexter will help you.

528
00:36:34,766 --> 00:36:36,123
Have a seat.

529
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:45,663
I was hoping we'd have a chance to speak again.

530
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:48,170
- We don't have anything to talk about.
- Oh, I beg to differ.

531
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,876
I think we have a lot to discuss.

532
00:36:50,468 --> 00:36:52,253
After all, you are a client.

533
00:36:52,514 --> 00:36:53,514
Former.

534
00:36:54,437 --> 00:36:55,952
Your program didn't work for me.

535
00:36:56,202 --> 00:36:59,669
Regardless, when I see someone
on a self-destructive path,

536
00:36:59,919 --> 00:37:01,720
I can't just stay silent.

537
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:05,681
Often, people get involved with someone
who is toxic to them.

538
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:07,614
Unstable and dangerous.

539
00:37:08,296 --> 00:37:09,960
Bad things happen.

540
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,188
Open.

541
00:37:15,724 --> 00:37:19,502
You're just now putting your life back together
after a terrible tragedy.

542
00:37:19,752 --> 00:37:20,656
I implore you.

543
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:23,586
Don't invite another one.

544
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:27,611
For yourself or for what's left of your family.

545
00:37:30,087 --> 00:37:32,123
You know, I'm glad you didn't touch any of them.

546
00:37:32,373 --> 00:37:33,776
Really? Why is that?

547
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:39,542
Because this DNA test will clear you
and leave you all to me. And to her.

548
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,803
Your time is up.

549
00:37:45,285 --> 00:37:46,475
There you go.

550
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,876
You're done.

551
00:37:50,706 --> 00:37:51,956
Thank you, Dexter.

552
00:37:54,027 --> 00:37:55,732
I'm here for you. Don't forget that.

553
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,852
<i>And soon, I'll be there for you.</i>

554
00:37:58,102 --> 00:37:59,444
I appreciate it.

555
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:16,024
What else did Jordan say?

556
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,046
That you were toxic...

557
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,307
and dangerous,...

558
00:38:21,557 --> 00:38:24,257
and that I was on a self-destructive path.

559
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:27,436
That sounds like a threat.

560
00:38:29,233 --> 00:38:31,674
He was trying to make me doubt...

561
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:34,460
you.

562
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,090
What do you think?

563
00:38:41,735 --> 00:38:42,756
You look...

564
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:47,230
- I look stupid, don't it?
- No, no.

565
00:38:47,502 --> 00:38:49,802
- No.
- You can tell me the truth.

566
00:38:52,345 --> 00:38:53,351
You look...

567
00:38:56,365 --> 00:38:57,233
perfect.

568
00:38:57,483 --> 00:38:58,420
Really?

569
00:39:04,573 --> 00:39:06,109
Look at those!

570
00:39:09,645 --> 00:39:11,006
These are beautiful.

571
00:39:13,427 --> 00:39:14,436
May I?

572
00:39:14,974 --> 00:39:15,990
Sure.

573
00:39:30,554 --> 00:39:31,854
The other way.

574
00:39:40,684 --> 00:39:43,222
Just be careful.

575
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,562
Oh, my goodness.

576
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:29,914
I'm thinking maybe I should
leave town for a while.

577
00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:32,741
- Take some sick days, get the hell out of here.
- No!

578
00:40:32,991 --> 00:40:35,377
The police could come back
with more questions about Cole.

579
00:40:35,627 --> 00:40:37,588
If you're suddenly gone,
it might look suspicious.

580
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:41,427
<i>- Well, at least I'll fucking be alive!
- Alex, you need to calm down.</i>

581
00:40:41,677 --> 00:40:44,578
<i>- I've taken steps to resolve the situation.
- What steps?</i>

582
00:40:44,828 --> 00:40:45,778
What are you talking about?

583
00:40:46,102 --> 00:40:46,834
I'm on top of it.

584
00:40:47,084 --> 00:40:49,518
<i>- No, not so far, you're not.
- I am.</i>

585
00:40:49,768 --> 00:40:51,227
And I need you to trust me.

586
00:40:51,494 --> 00:40:53,627
<i>- I do trust you. You know that.
- Good.</i>

587
00:40:53,888 --> 00:40:54,887
<i>Now, listen to me.</i>

588
00:40:55,164 --> 00:40:59,732
It's very important that you keep acting like
everything's normal. You're not gonna leave town.

589
00:41:00,286 --> 00:41:03,420
You're gonna maintain your regular routine.
To the letter.

590
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,927
<i>Do you understand?</i>

591
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:07,174
<i>Alex?</i>

592
00:41:07,523 --> 00:41:09,593
Tell me you understand what I've said.

593
00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:12,589
I understand.

594
00:41:12,901 --> 00:41:15,150
<i>Now go home like you always do.</i>

595
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,000
Have a vodka tonic. Watch TV.

596
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:20,276
I'll call you as soon as I know more.

597
00:41:20,815 --> 00:41:22,188
<i>Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

598
00:41:22,796 --> 00:41:24,313
<i>I promise.</i>

599
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:26,302
Okay.

600
00:41:35,517 --> 00:41:37,217
Right on schedule.

601
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:54,472
Detective Morgan, please?

602
00:41:57,678 --> 00:41:59,810
<i>- Morgan.
- Detective, it's Jordan Chase.</i>

603
00:42:01,996 --> 00:42:03,308
How can I help you?

604
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:06,778
<i>My lawyer doesn't know
I'm making this call.</i>

605
00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:10,188
- Okay.
- But those images you showed me,...

606
00:42:11,793 --> 00:42:14,143
I haven't been able
to get them out of my head.

607
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:16,327
They're very disturbing.

608
00:42:17,657 --> 00:42:18,807
They are.

609
00:42:20,108 --> 00:42:23,825
<i>I just want you to know, I've always
considered myself a friend of the police.</i>

610
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:27,300
Well, thank you, friend. What...

611
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,632
What is this about?

612
00:42:31,287 --> 00:42:35,429
A strange call came into my office
from an Alex Tilden.

613
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,558
Alex Tilden called you?
What did he want?

614
00:42:40,105 --> 00:42:44,636
I didn't speak to him myself, but my secretary
said that he was looking for Cole Harmon.

615
00:42:46,014 --> 00:42:48,117
<i>She said he sounded panicked,</i>

616
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:50,986
that he wanted to speak to Cole
about a flight he needed to arrange.

617
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:52,649
A flight to where?

618
00:42:52,899 --> 00:42:53,948
<i>That's all I know.</i>

619
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,704
It's not much, I realize, but...

620
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,662
I hope it can be useful.

621
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:00,817
<i>Thank you, Mr. Chase.</i>

622
00:43:07,394 --> 00:43:11,594
Saddle up. It looks like our
fantasy footballer's leaving town.

623
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:27,194
<i>No! No! Let me out of here!</i>

624
00:43:27,444 --> 00:43:29,597
<i>No! No! No!</i>

625
00:43:29,847 --> 00:43:33,574
<i>No! Stop! No! Let me go!</i>

626
00:43:33,824 --> 00:43:35,215
<i>No! No!</i>

627
00:43:35,465 --> 00:43:37,199
Oh, my God.

628
00:43:42,273 --> 00:43:43,489
Help!

629
00:44:00,693 --> 00:44:01,723
Who are you?

630
00:44:16,651 --> 00:44:17,696
What's that?

631
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:19,825
What...

632
00:44:32,659 --> 00:44:33,806
It's for her.

633
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:35,382
Who?

634
00:44:35,761 --> 00:44:37,611
Oh, I think you know.

635
00:44:39,738 --> 00:44:41,788
I mean, what's her name?

636
00:44:42,676 --> 00:44:45,292
Oh, now you want to know her name?

637
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:55,861
- Look, you really have this all wrong.
- Save it for her.

638
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,836
- What's the address?
- Alex Tilden, 3040.

639
00:45:00,352 --> 00:45:02,754
That's 3048. Here it is.

640
00:45:05,465 --> 00:45:06,544
And he's home.

641
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:17,255
I look different, don't I?

642
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:20,945
Without my hands tied behind my back.

643
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:26,330
But you recognize me.

644
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:28,199
I can tell.

645
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:37,555
I never wanted to do any of it.

646
00:46:37,805 --> 00:46:38,805
Really?

647
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:40,514
It wasn't me.

648
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:42,981
It was Jordan.

649
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,342
It's all Jordan.

650
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:48,187
He has this way.

651
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:51,275
Getting inside your head,
getting you in touch with your...

652
00:46:51,525 --> 00:46:52,639
primal nature?

653
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:54,313
He made me do things
I never would have done.

654
00:46:54,685 --> 00:46:55,685
No.

655
00:46:56,385 --> 00:46:57,352
You...

656
00:46:57,602 --> 00:46:59,527
made me do things
I never would have done.

657
00:47:00,116 --> 00:47:01,116
Ever.

658
00:47:01,895 --> 00:47:02,821
Ever!

659
00:47:05,836 --> 00:47:06,936
What do you people want?

660
00:47:07,647 --> 00:47:09,397
I can give you Jordan Chase.

661
00:47:09,674 --> 00:47:11,124
We've got Jordan Chase.

662
00:47:11,374 --> 00:47:12,824
Well, what do you want?

663
00:47:14,278 --> 00:47:15,597
Everybody wants something.

664
00:47:15,847 --> 00:47:20,721
I mean, that's what brought us to this
fucking unfortunate situation, am I right?

665
00:47:23,449 --> 00:47:25,946
I'm a banker.
I can get money. Lots of it.

666
00:47:26,196 --> 00:47:27,705
We can work this out, so tell me!

667
00:47:27,955 --> 00:47:30,713
What's this gonna cost?
Just give me a number.

668
00:47:35,731 --> 00:47:36,776
13.

669
00:47:38,977 --> 00:47:40,712
No. I...

670
00:47:48,376 --> 00:47:50,098
<i>There's a first time for everything.</i>

671
00:47:50,348 --> 00:47:52,432
<i>A first step. A first word.</i>

672
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:53,914
<i>A first kiss.</i>

673
00:47:54,231 --> 00:47:55,631
<i>A first kill.</i>

674
00:47:56,127 --> 00:47:58,780
<i>Somehow you know when the time is right.</i>

675
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,129
Aim for the heart.

676
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:43,088
You okay?

677
00:48:45,065 --> 00:48:46,065
Yes.

678
00:48:47,605 --> 00:48:51,272
We should lock down the airports
in case he tries to flee.

679
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,428
He's not going anywhere.

680
00:48:56,982 --> 00:48:59,189
Look at this. Looks like a partial footprint.

681
00:49:03,394 --> 00:49:05,644
It looks small. Maybe a woman's.

682
00:49:08,233 --> 00:49:09,883
And she was just here.

683
00:49:13,195 --> 00:49:14,195
Remember...

684
00:49:14,752 --> 00:49:17,582
at Boyd's house, that fucking hair book,
it had 12 pieces in it?

685
00:49:18,097 --> 00:49:19,747
But there are 13 DVDs.

686
00:49:21,638 --> 00:49:23,921
One of them didn't get their hair taken.

687
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,494
So what are you saying exactly?

688
00:49:26,943 --> 00:49:29,082
Well, what if one of them escaped...

689
00:49:29,332 --> 00:49:30,882
somehow and...

690
00:49:31,298 --> 00:49:34,223
after everything they'd done,
they've come back to get even?

691
00:49:34,707 --> 00:49:38,102
What if the vigilante is one of their victims?

692
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,200
<i>Harry tried to mold me into the image
of the monster he thought I was.</i>

693
00:50:04,632 --> 00:50:06,673
<i>He told me to flee human connection,</i>

694
00:50:06,923 --> 00:50:09,523
<i>so that became a way of life for me.</i>

695
00:52:26,572 --> 00:52:27,822
<i>But with Lumen...</i>

696
00:52:31,752 --> 00:52:33,502
<i>I'm someone different.</i>

697
00:52:38,177 --> 00:52:39,476
