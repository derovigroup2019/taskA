1
00:00:10,316 --> 00:00:11,349
<i>Previously on Dexter... </i>

2
00:00:11,884 --> 00:00:13,551
We are going to...

3
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:15,052
All: Take it!

4
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:18,089
Cole Harmon,
Chase's chief of security...

5
00:00:18,123 --> 00:00:20,658
torturer, rapist, killer.

6
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:22,793
It's time to tap into
my primal self.

7
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:23,961
Why did you want to see me?

8
00:00:23,996 --> 00:00:25,663
I am very interested
in what happened to you.

9
00:00:25,697 --> 00:00:29,066
I would like to discuss your
situation in-depth at another time.

10
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:32,136
Our informant, Yasmin Aragon,
was shot and killed.

11
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:33,905
This is a fucking disaster!

12
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:36,507
If mistakes were made, they
most certainly were not mine.

13
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:38,309
I can confirm
that Detective Morgan

14
00:00:38,343 --> 00:00:39,911
was in charge of the operation.

15
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:41,679
As of today, she's being placed

16
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:43,681
on immediate suspension
with pay.

17
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:45,583
It's just your word
against mine.

18
00:00:45,617 --> 00:00:48,653
Some people don't agree
with your version of the events.

19
00:00:48,687 --> 00:00:50,755
Who did you get to lie for you?

20
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,990
It was you.

21
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:54,258
Don't you want to know
about this girl

22
00:00:54,293 --> 00:00:55,660
shacked up with Dexter Morgan?

23
00:00:55,694 --> 00:00:58,029
Name: Lumen Pierce.

24
00:00:58,063 --> 00:01:00,865
Lumen shows up here
in Miami one week

25
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,802
before your boy's wife,
Rita Morgan, is murdered.

26
00:01:04,836 --> 00:01:06,671
Aah!

27
00:01:06,705 --> 00:01:08,372
You fuckin' bitch!

28
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:11,542
Who are the others?

29
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:14,178
The guy who held a watch
up to my ear.

30
00:01:14,213 --> 00:01:15,680
Tick-tick-tick.

31
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:17,648
"That's the sound
of your life running out. "

32
00:01:21,553 --> 00:01:23,521
It's what I tell my clients.

33
00:01:23,555 --> 00:01:24,855
Tick-tick-tick.

34
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,892
That's the sound
of your life running out.

35
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:29,493
Jordan Chase is one of them.

36
00:01:29,528 --> 00:01:31,729
We're gonna take down
Jordan Chase?

37
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:34,963
On a good day, when I run, the
voices in my head get quieter

38
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:40,035
until it's just me, my breath,
and my feet on the sand.

39
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:46,909
Pick up the pace, Dexter.

40
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:51,246
Today is not one of those days.

41
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:53,916
When I scheduled a private
session with Jordan Chase,

42
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,518
I wasn't looking for advice.
Just proof.

43
00:03:56,553 --> 00:04:00,522
Evidence of exactly how he was
involved in Lumen's torture,

44
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:03,292
because the code
requires certainty.

45
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,426
Faster, Dex.

46
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:06,462
I just wanted access
to his office,

47
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,364
the inner sanctum
where I could find clues.

48
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:13,168
Instead, I'm stuck here,
running in place.

49
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:16,772
Look, I get it.
You're frustrated.

50
00:04:16,806 --> 00:04:19,108
You feel like you're not getting
what you came here for.

51
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:21,009
Yeah, a bit.

52
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:22,711
Intense exercise works.

53
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:26,882
Tears down your defenses,
brings out your feelings.

54
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,151
Well, I have the feeling
that I'd be more comfortable

55
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,519
talking on a couch.

56
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,493
Trust me, this is the way
to build a new you.

57
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:44,566
At the seminar, we went over how
tragedy fractures us, right?

58
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:45,567
Yeah.

59
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:47,870
We're like Humpty Dumpty.

60
00:04:47,904 --> 00:04:48,971
And the big fall.

61
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:53,909
What I'm telling you now is
trauma is also opportunity.

62
00:04:53,943 --> 00:04:56,578
Tragedy tears us apart, sure.

63
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:59,181
But it's your one chance
to recreate yourself.

64
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,884
You get to put yourself back
together again any way you want.

65
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,219
Okay.

66
00:05:04,254 --> 00:05:06,421
Don't be skeptical.
I know it for a fact.

67
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,291
How?
What happened to you?

68
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:11,160
You didn't come here
to talk about me.

69
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:12,728
Something big
must have happened

70
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:14,763
if it inspired
your entire philosophy.

71
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,803
Okay, I'll tell you
where it started

72
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:22,504
if you promise
to keep it between us.

73
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:26,475
Plato.

74
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:28,310
What?

75
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,078
The notion of a fractured self.

76
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:32,214
<i>It's from Plato's Symposium.
You ever read it?</i>

77
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,550
Maybe in college.

78
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,884
But you don't remember it,
right?

79
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,252
Most people don't.

80
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:39,488
But for me,
it was a revelation.

81
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:41,557
It was exactly what
I needed at the time.

82
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,027
So... I took it.

83
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:47,563
I took Plato's idea
that we are fractured creatures,

84
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,965
trying to become whole,
and I ran with it.

85
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:52,134
Boom, a million copies sold.

86
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,941
So... Now you know my secret.

87
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:01,610
You ready to tell me yours?

88
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:06,215
Over your dead body.

89
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:08,650
An hour on the treadmill,
and I came up empty.

90
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:10,519
Not a clue.

91
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:13,488
Only upside is I got in
my cardio for the day.

92
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:15,791
Jordan is one tough nut
to crack.

93
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:18,594
You're one tough nut to crack,
you know that, Dexter?

94
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,028
I wish he'd stop doing that.

95
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:23,332
We ran for an hour.
You didn't give up anything.

96
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:26,368
I know you're in killer shape,
but you can't outrun me forever.

97
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:29,705
You have to give me
something to work with.

98
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:32,908
Otherwise...
How can I help you?

99
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:35,177
Maybe you can't.

100
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:37,212
Or maybe you can.

101
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:38,847
Is that blood?

102
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,451
No pressure.

103
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,787
It can take several meetings for
us to have a real breakthrough.

104
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,990
But I do need your commitment.

105
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:49,892
I need to get my hands
on that vial.

106
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:53,362
Otherwise, we're just
wasting our time.

107
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:56,265
I really think
I can help you, though.

108
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:57,699
I think so too.

109
00:06:57,734 --> 00:06:59,668
When can I get in
to see you again?

110
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:01,536
Check with my receptionist
on the way out.

111
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:03,839
I think I may have an opening
tomorrow morning.

112
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,085
Well, that was lucky.

113
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,887
10:00 A. M. tomorrow.

114
00:07:18,922 --> 00:07:21,523
He doesn't have anything else
for the next two weeks.

115
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:24,493
- Perfect.
- See you tomorrow.

116
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,595
I didn't notice you last time.
You new here?

117
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,263
Just started three days ago.

118
00:07:28,298 --> 00:07:30,933
I don't remember
so much security either.

119
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:34,336
Mr. Chase says
he's beefing things up.

120
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,305
That's no surprise.

121
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:40,609
Lumen and I have been knocking
off his friends one by one.

122
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:43,979
How many security guards?

123
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:46,181
I don't know.
Maybe a dozen.

124
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,549
But you think
that you can still

125
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,384
get to the blood
necklace thing, right?

126
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:51,286
Yeah. While Jordan's
in the shower.

127
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:53,322
Won't he notice
if it's missing?

128
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:54,556
No, I'm not gonna swipe it.

129
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,558
I'm just gonna extract
a sample.

130
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:58,727
I'll run it for DNA,
hopefully get an I. D.

131
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:00,362
Run it for DNA.

132
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,098
God, I love that
you can do that.

133
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,267
So whose blood
do you think it is?

134
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:08,203
- If it is blood.
- Most likely a victim.

135
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,905
Whatever it is,
it's important to him.

136
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:12,107
He's wearing it around his neck.

137
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:13,775
It's definitely
some kind of trophy.

138
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:18,780
Are you there?

139
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:20,782
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

140
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:22,951
There's someone
at the kitchen door.

141
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:27,022
- They're trying to get in.
- Go out the front door.

142
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:30,025
I'll be there in a few minutes.

143
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:31,860
Dexter, there's someone
there too.

144
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:33,028
Hide.

145
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:34,596
- Where?
- In the bathroom.

146
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,331
I'll get there
as fast as I can.

147
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:46,975
What's happening?

148
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:51,113
They're inside.

149
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:52,647
What?

150
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:01,123
They're coming!

151
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:03,925
Put the phone down.
Leave the line open.

152
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:28,216
Jesus!

153
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:29,451
Who the fuck are you?

154
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,886
Who the fuck are you?

155
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,321
Who the fuck is she?

156
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:35,590
You wanna try that again,
Astor?

157
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,993
Who is she?

158
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:39,995
Her name is Lumen.

159
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,863
I mean who is she?
Why is she here?

160
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:44,566
She's... Renting the house.

161
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,834
You said the house was empty.

162
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:48,170
Thought it was.

163
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:51,173
How was I supposed to know
he got a girlfriend so fast?

164
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:52,340
First of all,
she's not my girlfriend.

165
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,276
She's a tenant, like I said.

166
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,144
Second of all, who are you?

167
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:00,148
I'm Olivia.
I live near her grandparents.

168
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,050
Anyone wanna tell me
how you got here?

169
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:03,418
Taxi.

170
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:05,020
It's 215 miles.

171
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:08,290
From a bus station.

172
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:11,359
Where'd you get the liquor?

173
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:13,995
- Does it matter?
- Yeah, I'd say so.

174
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,432
- You're 12.
- You said you were 14!

175
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:19,434
Thanks a lot.

176
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:23,205
If you really wanna know,
we stole it from my house.

177
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:25,173
That's reassuring.

178
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,676
I think I need to sit down.

179
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,748
Do your parents know
where you are?

180
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:35,417
My mom thinks I'm at Astor's.

181
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:39,054
Oh. Let me guess, your grandparents
think you're at Olivia's.

182
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:40,856
Don't call 'em.

183
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,724
Please.

184
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:45,260
At least not until tomorrow.

185
00:10:45,294 --> 00:10:49,131
They should really
stay the night and sober up.

186
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:50,665
Then I'll stay too.

187
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,168
With her?

188
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:55,203
Oh.

189
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:59,541
I think I'm gonna...|

190
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,710
Here. Come with me.

191
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,212
I'll get you to bed, okay?

192
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:18,059
Quite a situation we have here.

193
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,729
Unless you have advice
on dealing with teenage girls,

194
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,297
I don't want to hear it.

195
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:24,733
My advice...
Get Astor out of here.

196
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,402
Tomorrow morning
you're collecting evidence

197
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,071
on a violent murderer
you plan to kill.

198
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,274
You really want a hung-over
preteen in the middle of that?

199
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:35,210
- She came here.
- Drunk!

200
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:36,778
I can't just turn her away.

201
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:40,649
Dexter, there's a reason serial
killers don't have children.

202
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:44,152
You can't be killer and dad.
Haven't you learned anything?

203
00:11:44,187 --> 00:11:45,987
Her mother is dead
because of you.

204
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:49,191
Which is why I need to make things
right and be a good father.

205
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:53,595
A good father would get those
girls as far away as possible.

206
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:01,503
Harrison's still
at the apartment with Sonya.

207
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:03,905
I'm gonna go get him,
bring him back here.

208
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,584
Deb.

209
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:17,452
You're gonna break something.
Relax.

210
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,720
You relax.
You're not about to have

211
00:12:18,754 --> 00:12:20,555
the worst meeting
of your career.

212
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,591
It's a union rep.
He's on your side.

213
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,160
You know, just be professional
and don't freak out

214
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:26,661
until you actually know
what's gonna happen.

215
00:12:26,696 --> 00:12:28,997
I know what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna get fired...

216
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:30,165
No, you're not.

217
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:31,666
Even Laguerta said
this isn't gonna stick.

218
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:33,969
- I'm supposed to trust her?
- No.

219
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,504
But you can trust me.

220
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,506
Everything's gonna be okay.

221
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,242
You know why?

222
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:41,943
'Cause you're gonna get
your job back.

223
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:43,912
You got everyone
at the station on your side.

224
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:46,081
You got a boyfriend
who loves you.

225
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,921
Seriously? You're gonna
drop that on me now?

226
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:54,990
It's just an expression.
It slipped out.

227
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,959
- I gotta go.
- Fine. Forget I said it.

228
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:04,299
What?

229
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,002
Good morning to you, too,
sunshine.

230
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,170
- You alone?
- Yeah. What's up?

231
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,872
Your pecker.
Soon as you take a look

232
00:13:10,906 --> 00:13:14,042
at these snaps I took
of your boy Dexter Morgan

233
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:17,679
and his gal pal on some kind of
middle of the night boat run.

234
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,881
- Wanna meet for a beer?
- It's 7:00 A. M.

235
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:21,216
Beer is good anytime.

236
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,152
- Yeah. I gotta work.
- Then I'll come to you.

237
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:26,154
What'd I just say?
I can't now!

238
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:27,822
I'll call you later.

239
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:49,444
You sure you wanna keep
your appointment with Jordan?

240
00:13:49,478 --> 00:13:51,379
Well, I need to.

241
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,049
There's not gonna be another
chance to get the blood.

242
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,619
Besides, it's something
I actually know how to do.

243
00:13:57,653 --> 00:14:01,022
You were a teenage girl,
right?

244
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:03,124
How do I deal with Astor?

245
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,793
Try talking to her.

246
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:06,027
Last time I did that,

247
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:07,896
she said she hated me
and moved to Orlando.

248
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,864
Well, now you get
a second chance.

249
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,206
Share something with her...
What you did when you were her age.

250
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,874
I killed the neighbor's dog.

251
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:22,911
Well, don't tell her that.

252
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,448
Seriously, what do I do?

253
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:29,050
Just... Cut her some slack.

254
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:31,252
All kids that age
make mistakes.

255
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,988
Trust me, the hangover
will be punishment enough.

256
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:37,992
Oh, is that your brother?

257
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:41,029
Harrison.

258
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:43,898
He doesn't even recognize me.

259
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:49,270
Well... You didn't look like a
raccoon the last time he saw you.

260
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,676
Eat.
It's hangover food.

261
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,145
It'll soak up the alcohol.

262
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:59,681
Talk to her.

263
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:02,384
Share something.

264
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:06,621
So I need to go
to a meeting in a few minutes.

265
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:11,092
But I was hoping after that we
could spend the day together,

266
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:15,063
'cause we really should talk.

267
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,701
So is that okay?

268
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:21,936
Can Harrison come?

269
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:23,304
Sure.
I'll call the babysitter,

270
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,240
tell her
there's a change of plans.

271
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,583
Mama.

272
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,255
Mama.

273
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:44,058
I have no idea
why he said that.

274
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:46,628
- I barely know him.
- Stop lying, okay?

275
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:49,164
I'm not stupid.

276
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,733
She's not your mama.

277
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:54,969
- Your mama's dead.
- Astor.

278
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:56,738
I'll tell you this.

279
00:15:56,772 --> 00:16:00,175
If you were the one who died, I
really doubt my mom would have

280
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,644
brought in a tenant so fast.

281
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:09,250
- I should go.
- I know.

282
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:11,052
We'll only be a couple hours.

283
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:12,687
I can handle it.

284
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:20,028
My family is pretty weird too.

285
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:26,835
Hey.

286
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,080
How'd it go
with the union suit?

287
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:41,382
They're sticking me
in the file room.

288
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,884
Till after my hearing.

289
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,053
You're not fired.
It's good news.

290
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,287
Yeah, it's great.

291
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:47,956
Except everybody still thinks

292
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,891
I'm responsible
for that girl dying

293
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,961
and all those kids getting
wounded in that nightclub.

294
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:57,131
For the record, my report
backed your story 100%.

295
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,967
Not that it mattered.

296
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:00,802
The brass backed my wife.

297
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:02,871
Matters to me.

298
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:05,573
Thank you.

299
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:08,543
Anybody needs
a real fucking detective,

300
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:10,945
I'll be in the file room.

301
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:16,317
Detective scapegoat
reporting for duty.

302
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:19,287
They said you'd be joining me.

303
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:22,824
Come on.
I can get you started.

304
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:24,826
Right over there.

305
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,162
So... How's it going
with that man of yours?

306
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:32,166
This morning out of the blue, he...
Told me he loved me.

307
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:33,268
Oh!

308
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,335
You say it back?

309
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,170
No. I ran.

310
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:37,906
What? What's the problem?

311
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,407
You don't feel the same way?

312
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:43,444
No, the problem is is that...
I'm afraid I might.

313
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,846
Oh!|

314
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,648
What is this,
the barrel girls case?

315
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:49,751
- File it under creepy?
- Under closed cases.

316
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:51,486
Not read, honey. File.

317
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,490
That's what I get paid to do,
and for the next few weeks,

318
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:57,292
So do you.

319
00:18:09,772 --> 00:18:10,939
Good session.

320
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:13,441
Another hour
of running in place.

321
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:15,910
You seem more open.
You feel the difference?

322
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:17,111
Yeah.

323
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:21,115
I feel like I might...
Take away something valuable this time.

324
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,451
Mm. Good.

325
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:25,687
Well, I gotta tell ya.

326
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:29,791
I still feel like you're not
being completely honest with me.

327
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:34,362
Really?|

328
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:37,131
- 'Bout what?
- About what you really want.

329
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:41,135
What I really want...
Just a drop.

330
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,638
A 30-gauge needle should
slide right in undetected.

331
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,543
He won't even notice
it's missing.

332
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:50,778
What do you mean?

333
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:53,481
What you want out of life.

334
00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:55,450
Whatever it is,
you have to tell me

335
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:58,186
so that I can help you
construct a plan to get there.

336
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,721
I have a plan to get there.

337
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:01,723
Lumen and I follow
this blood trail.

338
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:03,124
We take you out.

339
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:06,394
Believe it or not,
you're helping me already.

340
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:09,530
I hope so.
I really do.

341
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:21,242
Each of us...
Deep down, we know what we really want.

342
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:24,178
It's just a matter
of actually doing it.

343
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:25,313
Yeah.

344
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,484
Oh.
I gotta get back to work.

345
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:32,053
New evidence to process.

346
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,023
But, uh, thanks again
for everything.

347
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:37,125
So when's our next appointment?

348
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:39,927
I'll check with
the receptionist.

349
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,554
What did I tell you?

350
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:44,325
You're supposed to be filing
things away, not makin' a mess.

351
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,927
Wait, wait.
I was reading that.

352
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:49,330
- Yeah, that's the problem.
- Just give me one more second.

353
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:54,902
Holy shit!
Look at this.

354
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:56,504
What am I lookin' at?

355
00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:59,474
DNA results.
Multiple DNA results.

356
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,542
- The barrel girlsase?
- Mm-hmm.

357
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:04,879
We pinned this on one guy
and...

358
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:07,548
Looks like there are
multiple perps.

359
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:11,886
I'm just gonna...
Tell me what you see.

360
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,622
DNA sequencing report, uh...

361
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:17,358
Partial sequences on three,
maybe four perps?

362
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:19,327
What case is this?

363
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,329
Barrel girls.

364
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,464
Didn't we... Didn't we
pin this on one guy?

365
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:25,099
Yes. Boyd Fowler.

366
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:29,403
But the coroner found trace DNA
on the girls that wasn't Boyd's.

367
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:32,006
There were partial sequences
from multiple people.

368
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,875
It's all in the file.

369
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:36,344
Why am I only hearing
about this now?

370
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,946
Because by the time the final
coroner report came through,

371
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:40,414
we'd already closed the case.

372
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:42,083
The only reason
I came across this

373
00:21:42,117 --> 00:21:43,785
was because I was
filing it all away.

374
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:45,820
Look.

375
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:48,723
This is Cole Harmon,
our original suspect.

376
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:50,892
Jordan Chase's security guy.
We let him go.

377
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:54,796
We got DNA samples on him.
Tell me what you see.

378
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,931
There are enough common markers

379
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:58,766
that Cole Harmon
is looking pretty good

380
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:00,701
for the barrel girls' murders.

381
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,303
At the very least,
he can't be excluded.

382
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:04,972
What are you saying, that Cole
and Boyd did this together?

383
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:07,141
Yeah.

384
00:22:07,176 --> 00:22:10,578
With maybe three
or four others.

385
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:12,780
We gotta reopen this case.

386
00:22:12,815 --> 00:22:15,883
I know.
But I can't tell Laguerta.

387
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,952
I'm supposed to be
on file clerk duty.

388
00:22:20,455 --> 00:22:22,390
Wh... I'm not tellin' her.

389
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,859
This case was solved.

390
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:28,996
If I ask her to reopen it, I may
as well put my balls in a vice.

391
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:31,732
And not in a hot way either.

392
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,369
Well, that just leaves... Me.

393
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:48,282
Hey. You're late.

394
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:50,618
Yeah. Tough morning.

395
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:55,857
Astor showed up on my doorstep
last night drunk with a friend.

396
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:57,491
How old's the friend?

397
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,996
Just kidding.

398
00:23:07,236 --> 00:23:08,870
What's that?
Blood sample?

399
00:23:08,904 --> 00:23:11,005
Yes. It's a blood sample.

400
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:15,276
Top secret, huh?
I get it.

401
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,046
So... What is it?
Blood alcohol for Astor?

402
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:20,648
She vomited all over the floor.

403
00:23:20,682 --> 00:23:22,850
Further testing's
kind of unnecessary.

404
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:25,119
STD panel?

405
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,988
Vince, she's 12.

406
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:28,456
I meant for you.

407
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:34,295
It's a homicide victim I'm supposed
to have processed already.

408
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,965
I made a mistake,
forgot to submit it, okay?

409
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,700
Morgan.

410
00:23:39,735 --> 00:23:41,702
Dexter, the girls are gone.

411
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:43,871
Gone where?

412
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:45,139
I don't know.
But they're missing.

413
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,509
They felt terrible, and we didn't
have any Advil in the house,

414
00:23:48,543 --> 00:23:50,144
so I took Harrison
to the store.

415
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,779
- You left them alone?
- I was trying to be nice.

416
00:23:51,813 --> 00:23:53,414
And when I got back,
they were gone.

417
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:56,050
- Maybe they went for a walk.
- I don't think so.

418
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:57,251
The back door was wide open,

419
00:23:57,286 --> 00:23:59,353
and their cell phones
are still here.

420
00:23:59,388 --> 00:24:00,988
Dexter, what 14-year-old girl

421
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,723
willingly leaves
her cell phone behind?

422
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:04,692
Don't move.
I'll be right there.

423
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:06,527
I'm so sorry.|

424
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,975
What's going on?

425
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:23,577
I went to the neighbor's house
to see if he saw anything.

426
00:24:23,612 --> 00:24:25,079
- What?
- Hey.

427
00:24:25,113 --> 00:24:27,081
So I saw some guy
near the house.

428
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:29,717
Light hair, average build,
mid-30s.

429
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:32,553
Like Cole and Boyd and Dan.

430
00:24:32,587 --> 00:24:34,055
Oh, he had a white panel van.

431
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:35,690
And it was weird enough
I checked out the plate.

432
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,024
N4b something.

433
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,492
Why didn't you stop him?

434
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:40,094
I didn't know
the girls were in the house.

435
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:41,996
I mean, I didn't even know
you had a tenant.

436
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,831
Just thought he was a...
a painter or something.

437
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:45,900
Which is why you thought
to check the license plate?

438
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:48,035
Well, no, that's just habit
from neighborhood watch.

439
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,470
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

440
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,374
What are you doing?

441
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,677
Looking for signs
of a break-in.

442
00:24:56,712 --> 00:24:58,846
An abduction... That's what
we're thinking here, right?

443
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,348
Yeah. But it doesn't
make any sense.

444
00:25:00,382 --> 00:25:02,683
It does if someone
came looking for us.

445
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:04,452
Like one of Jordan's guys.

446
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:06,120
There's a reason
you were worried last night

447
00:25:06,154 --> 00:25:07,521
when you heard noises
in the house.

448
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:09,557
But I overreacted.
It was nothing.

449
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,860
Only this time there was someone
lurking around the house.

450
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,830
I shouldn't have stolen
that blood sample.

451
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:17,531
Not with the girls here.

452
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:22,203
We need to call the cops.

453
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:26,273
They'll just start
asking questions.

454
00:25:26,308 --> 00:25:27,908
And if it does have to do
with Jordan,

455
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,211
they'll probably trace it
all back to us.

456
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,783
Metro.

457
00:25:35,817 --> 00:25:37,718
This is Dexter Morgan
from Homicide.

458
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:40,721
I'd like to report
a probable child abduction.

459
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:43,891
It's a white panel van.
I have a partial plate.

460
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:48,996
We've issued a blanket
APB on the van.

461
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:51,999
NCIC has started a file
on the girls.

462
00:25:52,034 --> 00:25:53,667
Until we get them back safely,

463
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:56,604
Detective linker will be
our liaison to missing persons.

464
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,239
Did you call Olivia's parents?

465
00:25:58,273 --> 00:25:59,774
I tried.
I couldn't get a hold of them.

466
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,575
What about Astor's
grandparents?

467
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,010
They hadn't heard from her.

468
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:04,812
I didn't tell them
she was missing, though.

469
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:06,113
Didn't want to worry them.

470
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,149
- Yet.
- Most missing children

471
00:26:08,183 --> 00:26:10,284
are abducted by someone
the parents know.

472
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,186
Is there anyone
you can think of?

473
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,654
No. Nobody.

474
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:16,824
You sure?
No one new?

475
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:19,660
Where were you, anyway,
when they were taken?

476
00:26:19,694 --> 00:26:21,195
I can't lie about this.

477
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:23,664
Not with Astor's life
on the line.

478
00:26:23,698 --> 00:26:26,133
I was with Jordan Chase.

479
00:26:29,704 --> 00:26:34,708
He... offered me some private
sessions to help deal with...

480
00:26:34,743 --> 00:26:36,777
Rita's death.

481
00:26:39,314 --> 00:26:40,481
What?

482
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,785
A lot of fucked up people
circling that guy, Dex.

483
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,354
A lot? Who?

484
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:48,789
Besides Boyd Fowler.

485
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:50,724
Well, his head of security
for one.

486
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:52,993
I thought we cleared him.

487
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,662
May have been premature.

488
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,397
Okay... What's going on?

489
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:59,400
The barrel girls case might
not be as closed as we thought.

490
00:26:59,434 --> 00:27:01,635
Can we just find the van?

491
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:28,262
- Don't move!
- Show me your hands!

492
00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:29,997
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What... what's going on?

493
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:32,166
On your knees!
Hands on your head now!

494
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,001
Yeah, right there.

495
00:27:34,035 --> 00:27:35,669
Who is he?

496
00:27:35,704 --> 00:27:37,171
Name's Barry Kurt.
No priors.

497
00:27:37,205 --> 00:27:39,907
They found him at
a gas station on Coral.

498
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:44,879
- Where's Astor?
- Hey... Easy!

499
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,447
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.

500
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:47,815
- I'll kill you.
- Get your hands off of me.

501
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:50,351
- You understand me?
- He's looking for the girls

502
00:27:50,385 --> 00:27:52,186
- just like you.
- He's what?

503
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,088
I'm Olivia's father.
Sort of, anyway.

504
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:55,923
I live with her mom.

505
00:27:57,893 --> 00:28:00,161
I'm Astor's stepfather,
Dexter Morgan.

506
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:01,729
Yeah. You should
try to calm down.

507
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,731
He thought something
happened to his daughter.

508
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,433
Something is gonna happen
to them when I find them.

509
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:08,736
Olivia broke into
our liquor cabinet,

510
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,604
stole money from her mother,
and took off.

511
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,740
We've got GPS tracking
on her mobile phone.

512
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,242
I followed it to your house,
but they weren't there.

513
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,444
I figured I'd gas up the van
and go back.

514
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:19,947
Next thing I know,
I'm on my knees in cuffs

515
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:22,716
<i>like some loser on cops. </i>

516
00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:24,385
So where are they?

517
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,086
Probably causing trouble
somewhere.

518
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,521
Ever since Astor
moved down the block,

519
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:31,058
Olivia's been nothing
but a pain in the ass.

520
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,128
Morgan.

521
00:28:34,162 --> 00:28:36,463
Is he always this violent?

522
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:39,867
They found the girls
at Bayside.

523
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:41,402
They're holding them
for shoplifting.

524
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,249
Astor?

525
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:58,152
Thank God.

526
00:28:58,186 --> 00:29:00,154
We had the whole department
looking for you.

527
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:01,455
We were so worried.

528
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,957
You have no idea what you
put us through today.

529
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,926
- I'm sorry.
- What were you even thinking

530
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:08,295
- running off like that?
- Shoplifting?

531
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,563
That figures.

532
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:10,764
We didn't steal anything.
I swear.

533
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,666
I just tried on a ring
and forgot about it.

534
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:15,736
It was a mistake.
I gave it back.

535
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,672
I'm Detective Debra Morgan
from Miami Metro Homicide.

536
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:20,841
Mind if I take it from here?

537
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:24,078
Just make sure I don't
see these two again.

538
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:30,317
- Come on, we're going home.
- No!

539
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,052
- Now.
- My stuff's at Astor's.

540
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:34,154
- I need to go with her.
- You need to come with me.

541
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,257
- I don't want to.
- Tell you what.

542
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:37,558
Their stuff is at my house.

543
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:39,226
Why don't I take them there,
get them packed.

544
00:29:39,261 --> 00:29:40,694
We'll meet you in an hour.

545
00:29:40,729 --> 00:29:43,397
You're gonna need to get your
van out of impound anyway.

546
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:45,532
Which you're paying for,
by the way.

547
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:47,001
We'll meet you
at the Roadside Cafe.

548
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,137
- It's right near impound.
- Great.

549
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:54,241
Teenagers.
They can make you homicidal.

550
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:56,343
I know what you mean.

551
00:30:04,452 --> 00:30:05,953
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

552
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:10,057
You wanna tell me what's going on
with you and Detective Morgan?

553
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:12,593
Nothing.
What do you mean?

554
00:30:12,627 --> 00:30:15,996
Obviously, you've been talking
about the barrel girls case.

555
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:18,198
We found some new evidence.

556
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,501
You and Detective Morgan.

557
00:30:20,535 --> 00:30:22,436
She did.
In the file room.

558
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:26,173
I was going to tell you.

559
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:27,675
What?

560
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:29,243
You really don't see
what's going on?

561
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:33,580
I send her to the file room
with one assignment... file.

562
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:35,783
And then she magically
finds evidence

563
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:38,552
to reopen a case
she knows I personally closed.

564
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,322
Maria... It's DNA.

565
00:30:41,356 --> 00:30:43,157
It's not like she made it up.

566
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:46,894
She's trying to get back at me.

567
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,697
We pinned this on Boyd Fowler.

568
00:30:49,731 --> 00:30:52,199
I had five detectives
tell me he's the one.

569
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:55,269
And now I am telling you
that it's more complicated.

570
00:30:55,303 --> 00:30:58,939
- You need to reopen the case.
- I disagree.

571
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:02,009
Changing five names
on the murder board

572
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:04,578
from black to red isn't
gonna help this department.

573
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,448
The department?
Or you?

574
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:14,555
What happened?

575
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:17,458
Uh... There were at Bayside.

576
00:31:17,492 --> 00:31:19,860
- Oh, thank God.
- Shoplifting.

577
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,732
You gonna introduce us?

578
00:31:26,668 --> 00:31:28,035
That's the one I was
telling you about.

579
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:30,871
His new girlfriend.

580
00:31:30,905 --> 00:31:32,272
She's my tenant.

581
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:36,043
Lumen, this is my sister Debra.

582
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:38,045
Deb, Lumen.

583
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:41,582
I didn't know he had a tenant.

584
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:43,751
Didn't know he had a sister.

585
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:54,428
I'm gonna...
Go check on the girls.

586
00:31:57,198 --> 00:31:59,666
Seriously?

587
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:01,001
That's your tenant?

588
00:32:01,035 --> 00:32:03,537
- Yes.
- Oh.

589
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:06,206
Where's all her stuff?

590
00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:09,309
She hasn't really moved in yet.

591
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,279
But you know her well enough
to trust her with your son.

592
00:32:12,313 --> 00:32:13,480
It was an emergency.

593
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,082
I thought the girls
had been taken.

594
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:16,850
Why are you keeping her
a secret?

595
00:32:16,885 --> 00:32:17,985
I'm not.

596
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,420
Really?
'Cause at the station

597
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:20,988
we asked you who you were
spending your time with.

598
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,656
You didn't think to mention
the hot blonde

599
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,591
that's living in your house?

600
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:26,427
Didn't seem...
Like it mattered.

601
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:28,562
Obviously,
she didn't take the girls.

602
00:32:28,596 --> 00:32:31,465
That's not the point.

603
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:33,066
I'm not judging you.

604
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:35,068
Believe me, I understand rebound
as much as anybody.

605
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:37,137
But don't you think
it's a little soon?

606
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:38,472
I'm not on any rebound.

607
00:32:38,506 --> 00:32:40,541
Come on.
She's your tenant?

608
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:42,075
Really?

609
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,812
There's nothing going on.

610
00:32:44,846 --> 00:32:46,647
Fine.

611
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:48,715
I give up.

612
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,319
I gotta get back
to the station.

613
00:32:53,788 --> 00:32:56,523
Deb knows about
my partner in crime.

614
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:59,593
The whole station knows
I'm seeing Jordan Chase.

615
00:32:59,627 --> 00:33:02,229
This is not my day.

616
00:33:02,263 --> 00:33:04,164
Astor!

617
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:06,700
Just... Stay cool.

618
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,336
No matter what.

619
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:24,685
You want to tell me
what's going on with you?

620
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,453
No.

621
00:33:26,488 --> 00:33:27,955
'Cause nothing
is going on with me.

622
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:30,190
Something is.

623
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:33,727
You're drinking, shoplifting.

624
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,963
I already told you,
we didn't steal anything,

625
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:37,397
and it wasn't me anyway.

626
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,665
You want to tell me
why Barry thinks

627
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,033
you're the bad influence here?

628
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:41,301
'Cause he's an asshole.

629
00:33:41,336 --> 00:33:42,369
Stop.

630
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:46,874
This is not a good path
you're headed down here.

631
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:53,480
Look, just tell me
what's wrong, okay?

632
00:33:53,515 --> 00:33:55,382
I'm actually a good listener.

633
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,793
You want to know what's wrong?

634
00:34:06,828 --> 00:34:09,997
<i>My mom got murdered,
and you move her into our house</i>

635
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:11,265
and tell me she's your tenant?

636
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,366
She is.

637
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,902
She's more.
I can fucking tell.

638
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:16,503
Astor, you cannot
talk to me that way.

639
00:34:16,538 --> 00:34:18,138
Oh.

640
00:34:18,172 --> 00:34:23,810
I thought you said
you were this great listener.

641
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:26,280
I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

642
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:29,917
Then we'll just sit here
till you do.

643
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,627
You ready to go home?

644
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,796
Not really.

645
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,266
You know I ran away once, too.

646
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:48,268
I ditched out
on my own wedding.

647
00:34:48,303 --> 00:34:49,836
I didn't run away.

648
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,944
Who did that to you?

649
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,181
The bruises on your stomach.

650
00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:03,951
You don't know
what you're talking about.

651
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:09,623
Actually, I really do.

652
00:35:24,105 --> 00:35:26,039
I think we have a problem.

653
00:35:26,074 --> 00:35:27,341
Yeah, I'm in a battle of wills

654
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,676
with my drunk, shoplifting
teenage step-daughter,

655
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,545
and she's going to win.

656
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:34,481
Olivia has bruises
all over her stomach and back.

657
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:37,584
Someone's been hurting her.

658
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:39,720
She told you?

659
00:35:39,754 --> 00:35:41,188
No, I saw.

660
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,522
Wait, you knew about this?

661
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,658
Don't be mad.

662
00:35:44,692 --> 00:35:45,892
I'm not mad.

663
00:35:45,927 --> 00:35:51,164
I'm just, um...
I don't know what I am.

664
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:53,000
I'll be with Olivia.

665
00:35:56,471 --> 00:35:58,238
Promise you won't say anything?

666
00:35:58,272 --> 00:36:00,040
I don't want him
to hurt her more.

667
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,308
Who?

668
00:36:01,342 --> 00:36:02,909
Barry.
Who do you think?

669
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,177
<i>He is an asshole. </i>

670
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:07,881
Does her mom know?

671
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,250
He only hits her
in places that don't show.

672
00:36:10,284 --> 00:36:12,519
He gets all crazy over nothing.

673
00:36:12,553 --> 00:36:15,989
He doesn't like her hair,
she's two minutes late.

674
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:21,161
I thought she'd be safe here,
but then there's Lumen,

675
00:36:21,195 --> 00:36:24,898
and Barry showed up,
and we just... ran.

676
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,733
Why didn't you tell me?

677
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,535
'Cause I didn't think
you'd care.

678
00:36:31,806 --> 00:36:33,273
Of course I care.

679
00:36:33,307 --> 00:36:35,242
Even when we all lived here,

680
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,011
you were so busy
out doing stuff all the time.

681
00:36:43,084 --> 00:36:45,585
Olivia's my friend.

682
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,755
My only friend since mom died.

683
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:54,094
I wanted to help her, and...
I didn't know what to do.

684
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,197
You did know what to do.
You came home.

685
00:37:02,704 --> 00:37:04,404
I'm gonna take care of this.

686
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:05,839
Okay?

687
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,517
Everything okay with Astor?

688
00:37:17,552 --> 00:37:18,952
Nothing turning 20 won't fix.

689
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,020
What'd Laguerta say?

690
00:37:20,054 --> 00:37:22,589
She's not gonna
reopen the case.

691
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:25,959
She thinks that you have some
kind of vendetta against her.

692
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,561
That's fucking ridiculous.

693
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:28,829
Give her a day to cool off.

694
00:37:28,863 --> 00:37:30,197
We'll try again tomorrow.

695
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:38,505
You're not gonna
reopen the case?

696
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:39,573
Are you serious?

697
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:41,074
Come right in, detective.

698
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:44,644
There are at least
five dead girls in barrels.

699
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,980
And now there's DNA evidence

700
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,949
saying that some of the people
that are responsible

701
00:37:48,983 --> 00:37:50,817
are still out there.

702
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:55,655
And you think that's about me
trying to get back at you?

703
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,825
Did you even read the file?

704
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,160
There's fucking proof.

705
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,394
Just watch your tone.

706
00:38:04,132 --> 00:38:07,334
You know...

707
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,836
You throwing me under the bus
for the Fuentes brothers,

708
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:13,073
using your husband
as a chess piece,

709
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:14,775
putting Quinn
on bogus vacation days

710
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:16,710
so that I don't have
a fucking partner?

711
00:38:16,744 --> 00:38:19,613
If that's all just some game to
you, I'll try to understand it,

712
00:38:19,647 --> 00:38:23,049
but those girls are dead.

713
00:38:23,084 --> 00:38:25,252
Don't you want to make sure
that that doesn't happen again?

714
00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:30,090
I mean, what the fuck
are we doing here?

715
00:38:30,124 --> 00:38:31,258
Enough!

716
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:34,461
Okay.

717
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:35,762
Okay what?

718
00:38:37,431 --> 00:38:39,366
I'm reopening the case.

719
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,468
But you need to hear me,

720
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:44,304
because you have no idea
what you're talking about.

721
00:38:44,338 --> 00:38:49,543
I made the Fuentes situation
go away.

722
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,610
I was trying to help Batista.

723
00:38:50,645 --> 00:38:54,514
As far as Quinn goes,
he wasn't on vacation.

724
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:57,617
I suspended him.

725
00:38:57,652 --> 00:38:59,953
To protect your brother.

726
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,128
Protect him from what?

727
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:15,035
You're so interested in
the truth, ask Quinn.

728
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,746
Hey.

729
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,814
Can I talk to you?

730
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:30,450
In private?

731
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:35,722
Look, if this
is about this morning...

732
00:39:35,756 --> 00:39:37,390
Last month, when you told me

733
00:39:37,425 --> 00:39:39,226
that you were taking
some vacation days,

734
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,597
were you actually
on suspension?

735
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,998
Why?

736
00:39:45,032 --> 00:39:45,999
Who told you that?

737
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:47,000
Were you?

738
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:49,703
Did Laguerta say something?

739
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:51,638
She told me
I should talk to you.

740
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:55,508
Did it have something
to do with my brother?

741
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,379
Yeah.

742
00:39:59,413 --> 00:40:01,281
But it was nothing.

743
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,649
Then why did you lie?

744
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:11,558
I was investigating Rita's
murder, trying to help.

745
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:14,060
I had a lead on Kyle Butler.

746
00:40:14,095 --> 00:40:18,064
I figured if we could find
the person who knew Trinity,

747
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:20,767
then maybe we could
track down the creep

748
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:23,837
who killed
your sister-in-law.

749
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:26,506
Laguerta told me to back
off, leave it to the FBI.

750
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:31,878
When I didn't,
she suspended me.

751
00:40:31,913 --> 00:40:33,179
What was the lead?

752
00:40:33,214 --> 00:40:36,283
It doesn't matter.
It didn't pan out.

753
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:40,754
Laguerta told me that she
was protecting Dexter from you.

754
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:44,824
Why would she say that?

755
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:51,831
You remember those composite
sketches of Kyle Butler?

756
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:58,171
I got this crazy idea that
maybe it was your brother.

757
00:41:00,908 --> 00:41:04,277
Nothing came of it,
so I dropped it.

758
00:41:04,312 --> 00:41:07,547
I'm an idiot, okay?

759
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,418
Yeah, you are.

760
00:41:11,452 --> 00:41:13,553
Deb, I...

761
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:27,167
Shit.

762
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:30,136
<i></i>

763
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:45,352
What's this?

764
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:46,786
Where's Olivia?

765
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:51,124
I just wanted to...
Speak to you first, parent to parent.

766
00:41:51,158 --> 00:41:54,127
Oh.
You talk to Astor?

767
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:56,896
Yeah, I did.

768
00:41:58,132 --> 00:42:00,800
Honestly, I'm not sure
what I should do.

769
00:42:00,835 --> 00:42:02,402
I feel for you, man.

770
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:05,305
It's tough looking after
somebody else's kids.

771
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:09,309
Sometimes you just gotta
show 'em who's boss.

772
00:42:09,343 --> 00:42:14,280
Is that what you do with
Olivia, show her who's boss?

773
00:42:14,315 --> 00:42:15,382
What's that supposed to mean?

774
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:21,588
I know about Olivia's bruises,
how they're strategically placed

775
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,256
so they won't show.

776
00:42:25,526 --> 00:42:27,093
I don't know
what you're talking about.

777
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:31,297
No?

778
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:33,099
Let me show you?

779
00:42:36,337 --> 00:42:38,038
That's your solar plexus.

780
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,741
Right now, your diaphragm
is partially paralyzed,

781
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:44,210
which is why you're having
trouble catching your breath.

782
00:42:44,245 --> 00:42:46,746
What are you, man,
some kind of psycho?

783
00:42:46,781 --> 00:42:48,815
Not today.
Just a concerned parent.

784
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:49,816
Aah!

785
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,117
Ohh!

786
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,786
That's your liver.

787
00:42:54,221 --> 00:42:55,989
The nice thing
about the liver is

788
00:42:56,023 --> 00:42:58,458
if you hit it just right,
you get the vagus nerve,

789
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,226
which tentacles out
to the rest of your body.

790
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:05,198
Your brain short-circuits,
your body shuts down,

791
00:43:05,232 --> 00:43:08,601
and you feel,
what's the word, terror?

792
00:43:08,636 --> 00:43:11,571
Which is what Olivia felt
every time you hit her there

793
00:43:11,605 --> 00:43:13,506
just so the bruises
wouldn't show.

794
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:17,043
I want you to listen
to me carefully.

795
00:43:17,078 --> 00:43:19,312
Listen to me carefully, because
this is what you're gonna do.

796
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,314
You're gonna call
Olivia's mother.

797
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,917
You're gonna tell her
you're sick of her fat ass.

798
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:26,386
You can't stand
to look at it anymore.

799
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,588
And you're gonna
make her believe it,

800
00:43:28,622 --> 00:43:30,957
because if you don't,
she may take you back one day

801
00:43:30,991 --> 00:43:33,159
and let you near her kid
or mine.

802
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,661
And I can't let that happen.

803
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,899
You're not even gonna swing by
to pick up your stuff.

804
00:43:39,934 --> 00:43:41,101
You're just gonna leave.

805
00:43:41,135 --> 00:43:48,942
Tomorrow, when I drop Olivia
off, you will be gone.

806
00:43:48,976 --> 00:43:55,482
If you ever come back, believe me,
I won't go so easy next time.

807
00:43:57,618 --> 00:44:00,453
By the way, that's your kidney.

808
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,027
I can't believe it.

809
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,295
I don't want to hear it, okay?

810
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:11,131
"This isn't your business,
Dexter.

811
00:44:11,165 --> 00:44:12,799
"Don't get involved, Dexter.

812
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:14,734
You put too much
at risk, Dexter. "

813
00:44:14,768 --> 00:44:16,536
That's not
what I was gonna say.

814
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,040
I'm proud of you.

815
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:25,879
You are?

816
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:30,750
You protected Astor, put yourself
out there for another person.

817
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:34,521
I had no idea
you had that in you.

818
00:44:36,724 --> 00:44:38,057
I underestimated you.

819
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:42,495
Assumed you were a monster
when you were capable

820
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:44,764
of so much more.

821
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:48,401
If only I'd seen that,

822
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,370
maybe I wouldn't have
led you down this path.

823
00:45:05,419 --> 00:45:06,519
Deb?

824
00:45:06,554 --> 00:45:08,221
Hi, honey.

825
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:17,931
Get the fuck
out of my apartment.

826
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,032
I brought you a present.

827
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:20,967
Don't you
want to see what it is?

828
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:22,835
Your boy Dexter Morgan
and his lady friend

829
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:25,805
on his boat
at 3:00 A. M. in the morning,

830
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,807
and they are not fucking.

831
00:45:27,841 --> 00:45:29,275
What's in the bags?

832
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,376
Something heavy.

833
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:31,811
I'm thinking narcotics,
maybe a body.

834
00:45:34,615 --> 00:45:35,748
Are you crazy?

835
00:45:35,783 --> 00:45:37,817
Yeah, but that's
beside the point.

836
00:45:37,851 --> 00:45:41,354
Point is that when they came
back, those bags were gone,

837
00:45:41,388 --> 00:45:43,590
so whatever they're hiding,
it's something big.

838
00:45:43,624 --> 00:45:46,259
This was a bad idea.

839
00:45:47,795 --> 00:45:50,863
Here. Consider this
your severance package.

840
00:45:50,898 --> 00:45:52,599
We're done.

841
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:55,735
Really?

842
00:45:55,769 --> 00:45:58,638
What? You think you
can just pay me off

843
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,006
like I'm the corner whore?

844
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,475
I'm just saying,
it's time to stop.

845
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:05,511
And I'm sayin' bullshit.

846
00:46:05,546 --> 00:46:07,680
If this thing is as big
as I think it is,

847
00:46:07,715 --> 00:46:10,250
Laguerta and all them
other douchebags in homicide

848
00:46:10,284 --> 00:46:11,751
are gonna be kissing my ass.

849
00:46:11,785 --> 00:46:13,086
Back off, Liddy.

850
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,354
I mean it.

851
00:46:14,388 --> 00:46:17,590
I told you don't fuck with me.

852
00:46:19,393 --> 00:46:23,763
You know, I just think I may
call up that sister.

853
00:46:23,797 --> 00:46:26,165
Give her a ring, see
if she wants to get together,

854
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,301
have a drink,
maybe talk about the brother.

855
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:29,302
What do you say?

856
00:46:29,336 --> 00:46:31,804
Stay the fuck away from me!

857
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,340
And stay the fuck
away from Deb!

858
00:47:09,376 --> 00:47:12,445
So you really did
change your mind.

859
00:47:12,479 --> 00:47:14,180
I read the report.

860
00:47:16,116 --> 00:47:17,417
Thank you.

861
00:47:17,451 --> 00:47:18,685
Does this mean...

862
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:23,189
You'll stop sleeping
on the couch?

863
00:47:25,526 --> 00:47:28,194
We still got a long way to go

864
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:30,830
between the couch
and the bedroom, Maria.

865
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:40,740
So, what, now you're
not even talking to me?

866
00:47:44,211 --> 00:47:49,649
Deb, look, I had an idiot
theory and I dropped it.

867
00:47:49,683 --> 00:47:51,617
Yeah, because
Laguerta suspended you.

868
00:47:51,652 --> 00:47:54,554
No, because I was wrong.

869
00:47:54,588 --> 00:47:56,956
Look, what I said
yesterday is true.

870
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:00,026
I love you, and I'm
not taking it back.

871
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:03,930
You don't even know
what that means.

872
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,199
It means I'd never do
anything to hurt you.

873
00:48:06,233 --> 00:48:08,401
Ever.

874
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:10,737
I trusted you.

875
00:48:10,771 --> 00:48:12,171
And while you were fucking me,

876
00:48:12,206 --> 00:48:14,273
you were spreading shit
about my brother behind my back.

877
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,809
You think
that's not hurting me?

878
00:48:16,844 --> 00:48:18,411
Fuck you.

879
00:48:38,799 --> 00:48:40,833
You want us
to come inside with you?

880
00:48:40,868 --> 00:48:42,702
No, I'll be okay.

881
00:48:42,736 --> 00:48:44,504
I could barely understand
my mom on the phone

882
00:48:44,538 --> 00:48:46,072
with all the crying,

883
00:48:46,106 --> 00:48:49,108
but she actually said
Barry did her a favor leaving.

884
00:48:49,143 --> 00:48:50,743
He definitely did me a favor.

885
00:48:50,778 --> 00:48:52,412
He told her she has a fat ass.

886
00:48:53,547 --> 00:48:54,981
He is not coming back.

887
00:49:03,157 --> 00:49:04,223
Thank you.

888
00:49:04,258 --> 00:49:06,392
Call you later.

889
00:49:30,684 --> 00:49:32,585
Are you gonna tell
grandma and grandpa?

890
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:37,356
About you getting drunk
in Miami and shoplifting?

891
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,791
Nah, that's up to you.

892
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,330
We all have our secrets, right?

893
00:49:44,364 --> 00:49:46,165
Thanks.

894
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,303
- But if it ever happens again...
- It won't.

895
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:54,841
- And if Barry ever shows up...
- I'll tell you, I promise.

896
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:02,215
I'm proud of you.

897
00:50:03,383 --> 00:50:04,617
You are?

898
00:50:04,651 --> 00:50:10,790
Yeah. You... put yourself out
there for another person.

899
00:50:13,827 --> 00:50:15,361
I want you to know something.

900
00:50:15,395 --> 00:50:18,464
If Lumen's your girlfriend,
I want you to tell me.

901
00:50:18,499 --> 00:50:21,167
Okay.

902
00:50:21,201 --> 00:50:22,568
But she's not.

903
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,570
She's not just
your tenant, though.

904
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:31,844
She's a friend who's been
through some really...

905
00:50:31,879 --> 00:50:33,145
Really bad stuff.

906
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,415
I'm helping her deal with it.

907
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,652
Does it make you feel better?

908
00:50:39,686 --> 00:50:41,354
What do you mean?

909
00:50:41,388 --> 00:50:42,922
About mom.

910
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,490
Being there for Lumen,

911
00:50:44,525 --> 00:50:47,760
does it make you feel better
about what happened to mom?

912
00:50:58,505 --> 00:51:00,172
I love you.

913
00:51:02,376 --> 00:51:04,010
You know that?

914
00:51:07,047 --> 00:51:11,317
You should come in, say hi to Cody.

915
00:51:11,351 --> 00:51:14,353
It'll blow your cover, about Miami.

916
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,700
Mama.

917
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:30,970
This is mama?

918
00:51:32,105 --> 00:51:33,573
Mama.

919
00:51:36,577 --> 00:51:37,910
Okay, bud.

920
00:51:41,381 --> 00:51:46,052
Jordan Chase told me to
figure out what I want most.

921
00:51:46,086 --> 00:51:48,321
The answer is simple.

922
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:52,191
To be a good dad.

923
00:51:52,225 --> 00:51:53,526
But now that Astor's safe,

924
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,395
what I want most
is Jordan on my table.

925
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,764
I need to get
an I. D. on that blood.

926
00:52:00,634 --> 00:52:02,368
- Hey.
- Hey.

927
00:52:02,402 --> 00:52:04,403
How was Orlando?

928
00:52:04,438 --> 00:52:06,872
Uh, it was
pleasantly uneventful.

929
00:52:06,907 --> 00:52:10,476
Astor's back with her grandparents,
Cody grew about a foot.

930
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:13,713
Oh. Glad to hear it.

931
00:52:13,747 --> 00:52:15,881
Your blood results
are in, by the way.

932
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,429
So did you get back an I. D.
on your homicide victim?

933
00:52:30,464 --> 00:52:32,598
No.

934
00:52:33,967 --> 00:52:35,067
Then what's that?

935
00:52:35,102 --> 00:52:37,336
She's not a victim.

936
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:39,572
She's alive, boozing it up
in Coral Gables.

937
00:52:39,606 --> 00:52:41,574
Two D. U. I. s in three years.

938
00:52:41,608 --> 00:52:43,275
I guess I messed up.

939
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:45,878
If she's not a victim,
then who is she?

940
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:46,912
No worries.

941
00:52:46,947 --> 00:52:50,449
When you mess up, it makes
me feel better about me.

942
00:53:05,165 --> 00:53:06,666
Dexter?

943
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,668
No, it's Jordan Chase.

944
00:53:08,702 --> 00:53:10,770
But I'm looking for Dexter.
Is he there?

945
00:53:13,373 --> 00:53:16,942
He...
He's not available right now.

946
00:53:16,977 --> 00:53:18,944
Can I leave a message?

947
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,447
Uh-huh.

948
00:53:23,984 --> 00:53:25,685
Tell him I'm just checking in,

949
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:27,953
and I'd like him to schedule
another appointment

950
00:53:27,988 --> 00:53:29,955
as soon as possible.

951
00:53:31,992 --> 00:53:33,426
Okay.

952
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,027
I will. Bye.

953
00:53:35,062 --> 00:53:37,596
Hang on a second.

954
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,799
Tell Dexter one more thing.

955
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:42,802
Okay.

956
00:53:42,836 --> 00:53:46,338
Tell him time
is of the essence.

957
00:53:46,373 --> 00:53:50,009
Tick tick tick.

958
00:53:50,043 --> 00:53:53,813
That's the sound
of his life running out.

959
00:53:53,847 --> 00:53:55,881
Could you be sure
to tell him that?

960
00:53:59,586 --> 00:54:00,820
Take care, Lumen.
