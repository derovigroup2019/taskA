2
00:01:46,738 --> 00:01:49,606
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:53,277
My wife died
and it was my fault.

4
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:57,549
Your dead wife
can suck my dick.

5
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,751
That's the first human thing

6
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,354
I've seen you do since she died,
Dexter.

7
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:05,091
I don't want to live with you.

8
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,360
I want to live
with grandma and grandpa.

9
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:08,395
FBI.

10
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,963
Fucking bunch of idiots.

11
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,898
We know you didn't
kill your wife.

12
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:13,633
We're just looking for
a reason why Arthur Mitchell

13
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:14,768
might have targeted her.

14
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:15,869
We all good here?

15
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:19,106
The only lead we have now
is this Kyle Butler.

16
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,607
It looks like Santa Muerte,
the cult.

17
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,608
Who are you?

18
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,543
Officer Manzon, Cira.

19
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:25,712
We have sex one day and then...

20
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:26,980
I'm sorry,
I'm not the kind of person

21
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,281
who would ever have sex
with you.

22
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,050
Okay, we had sex.

23
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:31,085
Was it good sex?

24
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:33,020
I've said all I'm gonna say.

25
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:34,788
You're welcome to stay here

26
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,124
for as long as you want,
whenever you want.

27
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,892
I heard the FBI interview
went well.

28
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:41,463
They're looking for someone
named Kyle Butler.

29
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:42,931
He's a friend
of Arthur Mitchell's.

30
00:02:42,965 --> 00:02:44,299
They've having sketches done.

31
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:46,735
The Mitchell family all gave
very different versions.

32
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,904
Do you mind if I keep
a copy of these?

33
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:50,539
You married Maria Laguerta?

34
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:52,207
Such a fine piece of ass.

35
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:54,209
You fuck!

36
00:02:56,313 --> 00:02:57,879
Boyd Fowler.

37
00:02:57,914 --> 00:03:00,115
You're probably used to seeing
dead things though, huh?

38
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:05,052
Can't say I ever get
used to it.

39
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:06,787
You want that nice house
on the beach.

40
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:08,255
Take it!

41
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,890
I can see having an
old girlfriend's lock of hair,

42
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:13,793
but identified
by only a number?

43
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,578
I'm just trying
to get to the truth.

44
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,113
However long that takes
is up to you.

45
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,416
I'm telling you the truth.

46
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,751
I'm not lying.

47
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:39,987
First, you said you didn't do
drugs and then you said you did.

48
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:43,023
I said I might have tried
some at a Tridelt party once.

49
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:44,258
You might have?

50
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:45,794
What the fuck does
that even mean?

51
00:03:45,828 --> 00:03:46,961
You did or you didn't.

52
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:48,163
You can't kind of do blow.

53
00:03:48,197 --> 00:03:50,166
But that was six years ago
in college.

54
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,868
And I'm supposed to believe
you're not on anything now?

55
00:03:52,903 --> 00:03:53,936
I'm totally clean.

56
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,705
Then why are you so nervous?

57
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,241
Because I wasn't expecting on
getting these kinds of questions.

58
00:03:58,275 --> 00:03:59,842
I mean, you sound like a cop.

59
00:03:59,877 --> 00:04:01,377
I am a cop.

60
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:03,980
I work for Miami Metro Homicide.

61
00:04:04,014 --> 00:04:06,749
Look, I don't know what's
going on here.

62
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,951
I came for a nanny job.

63
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:12,221
I'm not, like, planning
to kill the president.

64
00:04:12,256 --> 00:04:16,225
Harrison needs a nanny and Deb
insisted on running point.

65
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:20,062
The way it's going, only Mary
poppins would make the cut.

66
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:21,531
I don't care what doctors say.

67
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:26,369
I think it's important for
children to eat a lot of cheese.

68
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:32,375
Well, if a child's choking, I
just do what my mama always did.

69
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,410
You get ahold of it by the legs

70
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:39,817
and you give it
a little knuckle-slap.

71
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:42,353
No, I've never had
martial arts training,

72
00:04:42,387 --> 00:04:44,456
but I can scream real loud.

73
00:04:51,363 --> 00:04:53,899
I have a nursing degree
with an emphasis

74
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:56,267
on infant/toddler growth
and development.

75
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:58,436
Why not work at a hospital?

76
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,671
Well, I did, but, um,
there were budget cuts,

77
00:05:00,705 --> 00:05:02,939
and my ward was downsized.

78
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:04,407
I live alone.

79
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:05,675
I don't need a big salary,

80
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,845
so a nanny position would work
very well for me.

81
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,519
He's tired.

82
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:18,723
May I?

83
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:21,559
I don't bite.

84
00:05:21,593 --> 00:05:22,661
Okay.

85
00:05:22,695 --> 00:05:23,962
Hi.

86
00:05:23,996 --> 00:05:26,231
Ooh.

87
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:29,902
What a little prince you are.

88
00:05:29,936 --> 00:05:33,572
Mmm.

89
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:36,041
? Bye baby bunting ?

90
00:05:36,076 --> 00:05:40,880
? daddy's gone a hunting ?

91
00:05:40,914 --> 00:05:44,050
? gone to find a rabbit skin ?

92
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:47,553
? to wrap the baby bunting in ?

93
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:48,955
And then there was sonya.

94
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:51,891
Practically perfect
in every way.

95
00:05:51,925 --> 00:05:53,225
Well, you have my number.

96
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:54,460
I'll look forward to your call.

97
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:56,796
Again, my condolences
for your loss.

98
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,664
Thanks.
We'll be in touch.

99
00:05:58,698 --> 00:06:01,467
Bye, prince Harry.

100
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,204
She's the one.

101
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:07,907
Are you sure you don't want
to keep looking, Dex?

102
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:10,776
I just don't want to lose her.

103
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,046
Prince Harry likes her.

104
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,280
Ditto me.

105
00:06:15,314 --> 00:06:19,783
Then call her.

106
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:21,118
Don't forget,
you and Harrison...

107
00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:23,386
crisis counselor.
I won't forget.

108
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,788
Love you, bro.

109
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:31,593
Me too.

110
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:43,338
Emptiness wasn't
always a problem.

111
00:06:43,372 --> 00:06:46,141
I used to cherish it.

112
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:51,646
But now it feels like
something to overcome.

113
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,881
Emptiness is all she has left.

114
00:06:57,853 --> 00:06:59,421
Boyd Fowler.

115
00:06:59,455 --> 00:07:00,822
Department of sanitation.

116
00:07:00,857 --> 00:07:04,493
Division of dead animal pickup.

117
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:09,364
Hobbies: Self-improvement and
storing women in formaldehyde.

118
00:07:09,398 --> 00:07:11,666
I don't know if killing you
will fill the void,

119
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:13,902
but it's a place to start.

120
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,509
What's this?

121
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:22,344
Atm surveillance video.

122
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,181
The bank sent it over.
This is our shotgun guy.

123
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:26,717
- Francisco Alfaro?
- Yeah.

124
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,752
It's what he looked like
when he had a face.

125
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:30,354
When was this taken?

126
00:07:30,388 --> 00:07:34,091
Two hours before he killed his
wife and blew his own head off.

127
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,059
Trying to get cash,

128
00:07:36,093 --> 00:07:38,195
but he keeps putting in
the wrong pin number.

129
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:39,463
0371.

130
00:07:39,497 --> 00:07:40,631
His wife's birthday.

131
00:07:40,665 --> 00:07:41,798
Ouch.

132
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,400
Good thing she's dead.

133
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:47,971
He never would have
lived that down.

134
00:07:48,006 --> 00:07:50,940
What the hell happened
to you guys?

135
00:07:50,975 --> 00:07:52,475
Battle scars.

136
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,679
We had to get ghetto on some
dirt-bag at the club last night.

137
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:57,947
You guys got in a bar fight?

138
00:07:57,981 --> 00:07:59,549
It's not worth talking about.

139
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,717
True warriors are humble men.

140
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:02,852
Oh, please.

141
00:08:02,886 --> 00:08:04,520
You got a reason to be humble.

142
00:08:04,554 --> 00:08:05,921
You got fucked up running
the other way.

143
00:08:05,956 --> 00:08:08,958
You're confusing cowardice
with a tactical retreat.

144
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:10,492
<i>Hermano, back me up here.</i>

145
00:08:10,526 --> 00:08:12,060
You backed up just fine
on your own.

146
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:15,596
Okay, let's focus
on the case, people.

147
00:08:15,631 --> 00:08:17,431
Remember why we're getting paid.
Okay.

148
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:18,766
I'll go first.

149
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,568
Guy offs his wife,
wants to skip the country.

150
00:08:20,602 --> 00:08:23,971
Needs cash, but he's so wigged
out, he can't remember the pin.

151
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:25,772
Gives up, goes home,
kills himself.

152
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,607
Only problem with that
theory is Alfaro

153
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,408
doesn't have a motive
to kill his wife.

154
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:30,910
Maybe he's just sick of her.

155
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,746
Oh, yeah, he got sick of her?

156
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,214
Got sick of her,
so he cut off her head

157
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:35,649
and put it in a park and put
candles all around it?

158
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,884
Yeah.
Have you watched the video?

159
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,386
'Cause he's a little
fucking crazy.

160
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,854
Crazy does not explain
why he doesn't

161
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,122
have a drop of blood
on his clothes.

162
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:43,323
Why don't you think
about that for a second?

163
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,725
How do you
cut somebody's head off

164
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,959
and not get a drop
of blood on you?

165
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:47,094
What'd he do?
What, wear a bib?

166
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:49,430
As much fun as this is,

167
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:50,831
we're not gonna hash this
out in the room.

168
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:52,400
- I would like to re-canvass
the neighborhood

169
00:08:52,434 --> 00:08:54,635
where Mrs. Alfaro's body
was found.

170
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,304
There are a lot of houses
facing that park.

171
00:08:56,338 --> 00:08:57,572
Somebody's bound to talk.

172
00:08:57,606 --> 00:08:58,773
Start today.

173
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:00,642
And I think Batista
should be there.

174
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:03,379
Hispanic neighborhood.
Hispanic cop.

175
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:04,814
Might raise the comfort level.
Loosen tongues.

176
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:06,516
I get it.

177
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,784
Okay.

178
00:09:07,818 --> 00:09:09,119
The rest of you,
stay with the case.

179
00:09:09,153 --> 00:09:11,955
Work your leads.

180
00:09:11,989 --> 00:09:14,424
Thanks.
Beautiful.

181
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,359
- Angel?
- Mm-hmm?

182
00:09:16,393 --> 00:09:18,795
Just how big was this fight?

183
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:20,797
Like I told you this morning,
it was a disagreement

184
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:21,964
that got out of hand.

185
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:24,167
Too much booze.
Too much testosterone.

186
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:29,840
Uh...
You punched another cop.

187
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:31,775
<i>I mean, que Paso?</i>

188
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:33,043
What started it?

189
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:35,112
We hashed it out.

190
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:36,613
<i>Hombre a hombre.</i>

191
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:39,649
It's settled.

192
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:46,089
Pretty sure his appetite's
about the same.

193
00:09:46,123 --> 00:09:49,091
He's always been kind
of a messy eater.

194
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,859
It's hard to tell.

195
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:52,661
His sleeping pattern?

196
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:54,395
Same.

197
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,066
Unfortunately he cries
about three times a night

198
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,737
on a good night.

199
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:05,073
So you're not surprised that
he's acting pretty much normal?

200
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:06,908
No.

201
00:10:06,943 --> 00:10:10,078
You and Harrison suffered
a terrible tragedy.

202
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:11,880
It's no getting around that,

203
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:14,483
but there is something
to be thankful for.

204
00:10:14,517 --> 00:10:16,185
Thankful?

205
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:18,020
Yes.

206
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:22,492
Harrison's cognitive abilities
are really just developing.

207
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:28,531
So you're saying he might not
be affected by what he saw?

208
00:10:28,565 --> 00:10:30,667
There's just simply no chance
that he was able

209
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:32,368
to comprehend
what was happening.

210
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:40,209
I saw something pretty traumatic
when I was three.

211
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:44,180
Harrison's only ten months.

212
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:49,019
It affected me a lot.

213
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:50,487
You don't have any idea.

214
00:10:50,522 --> 00:10:54,291
I've seen a lot of children.

215
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:55,893
We'll keep an eye on Harrison,

216
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:59,730
but I really think your son
is gonna be perfectly fine.

217
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:08,340
Ooh.

218
00:11:08,374 --> 00:11:12,311
He wants his head back.

219
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:14,079
Ahh.

220
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:16,647
Children Harrison's age
can exhibit

221
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:18,516
what might seem
like violent behavior,

222
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,317
but they're just
releasing energy.

223
00:11:20,352 --> 00:11:22,920
It's important not
to read into it.

224
00:11:22,954 --> 00:11:26,589
I'll try not to.

225
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:29,191
The most important thing
you can do right now

226
00:11:29,226 --> 00:11:30,826
is take care of yourself.

227
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,896
Find some time to release
your own energy.

228
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,667
Do something for Dexter.

229
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:41,503
Dexter will.

230
00:11:41,537 --> 00:11:44,139
I have nothing to say.

231
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:45,539
I didn't see no one.

232
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:49,843
Well, if you remember anything
or if you hear anything...

233
00:11:49,878 --> 00:11:50,945
- yes, mm-hmm.

234
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:53,481
I call you.

235
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:57,451
We're never gonna hear
from her.

236
00:11:57,486 --> 00:11:59,821
All this no talking
is fucking frustrating.

237
00:11:59,855 --> 00:12:01,789
Yeah.

238
00:12:01,824 --> 00:12:03,224
You know what's frustrating?

239
00:12:03,258 --> 00:12:05,293
9 days, 13 hours.

240
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:06,561
What?

241
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:08,530
Since we... you know?

242
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:10,032
Just...
You're counting?

243
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:12,167
I can't help it.
I have an internal clock.

244
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:14,203
Well, unplug it.

245
00:12:14,237 --> 00:12:17,240
I'm just saying, at this point,
we might as well be married.

246
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:18,408
Shit on my face.

247
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:20,176
You ever words like
"we" and "married"

248
00:12:20,211 --> 00:12:23,246
in the same fucking sentence again...
whoa.

249
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:24,915
Another case
of temporary blindness.

250
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:26,016
Anything?

251
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:27,518
These people are
all afraid of something.

252
00:12:27,552 --> 00:12:29,286
Yeah, I'm getting that too.

253
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:30,821
Maybe they just don't want
to get involved.

254
00:12:30,856 --> 00:12:32,222
No, I think it's more
than that.

255
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:34,291
If the killer's dead,
what are they afraid of?

256
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:35,592
I thought I could make
some headway,

257
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:38,161
but the reality is this
is a venezuelan neighborhood.

258
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:39,895
- So?
- I'm Cuban.

259
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,165
Officer Manzon's
from this neighborhood.

260
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:44,332
Manzon?

261
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:46,635
She's a uniform, but she
might be worth bringing in.

262
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:48,403
She thinks these are
about religious murders.

263
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:49,403
<i>Santa mierda.</i>

264
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:53,741
<i>That's Santa Muerte.</i>

265
00:12:53,776 --> 00:12:55,243
It's "Saint Death,"

266
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:56,578
not "Saint Shit."

267
00:12:56,612 --> 00:12:58,780
And Manzon might
be on to something.

268
00:12:58,814 --> 00:13:00,682
Might explain
why no one's talking.

269
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:02,083
Shut up.

270
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:26,406
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Dexter.

271
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:27,707
Hi.

272
00:13:27,742 --> 00:13:29,108
Yeah, I don't know
if I mentioned,

273
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,676
but for his nap, Harrison likes

274
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:33,579
the puppy blanket
just touching his face.

275
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:35,581
It's on your checklist.

276
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,384
Uh, item eight under
"sleep preferences."

277
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,587
Okay, good.
How's he doing?

278
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,989
<i>We just read
the very hungry caterpillar</i>

279
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,958
for the seventh time.

280
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,526
Don't worry.

281
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,998
He usually gets sick
of it around the 20th read.

282
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,268
I gotta go.

283
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,472
Yeah, you call me
if there's anything.

284
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,743
Thought he'd never spot me.

285
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:10,415
Some coinkydink, huh?

286
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,083
You find any more dead animals?

287
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,953
Looks like you're
working on something.

288
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,955
Tastes a lot better
than it looks.

289
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,324
Have a seat.

290
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,997
Boyd Fowler.

291
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,066
Daryl Tucker.

292
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:32,403
You work around here?

293
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:37,843
I just love the arabica.

294
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,244
Actually, I'm between jobs.

295
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,780
Hence the want ads.

296
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:44,782
What kind of work
you looking for?

297
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:46,684
Oh, not choosy.

298
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:50,754
Whatever pays and
gets me out of the house.

299
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:52,522
You like what you do?

300
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:55,258
I love it.

301
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:56,859
Probably wouldn't think so,
driving around,

302
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:58,094
picking up dead animals.

303
00:14:58,128 --> 00:15:01,296
Eh, beats working in a cubicle.

304
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:03,732
You get out in the fresh air.

305
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:05,667
Well, I guess most
of the time it's fresh.

306
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:09,437
It's not boring.

307
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:11,573
Never know what's
around the next bend.

308
00:15:11,607 --> 00:15:17,113
Full of surprises.

309
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:20,550
You know...
If you're interested, we might have

310
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:21,551
an opening at animal pickup.

311
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:22,786
Really?

312
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,521
Yeah, there ain't exactly
a line either.

313
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,426
You should take a ride with me.

314
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,128
See if you like it.

315
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,231
You got to be okay around
dead things though.

316
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,634
I don't think that's a problem.

317
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:38,435
Great.

318
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,970
Tomorrow morning,
8:00 sharp.

319
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:43,573
I would have settled
for your work schedule,

320
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,676
but this could be better.

321
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,980
Only 24 hours to get ready.

322
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:52,548
Boyd's patrol route.

323
00:15:52,582 --> 00:15:58,588
Need to find a place where we
can spend some quality time.

324
00:15:58,622 --> 00:16:01,625
There.

325
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:13,770
An old tourist welcome center.

326
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:15,739
Not very welcoming now.

327
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:32,956
Totally isolated.

328
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,793
Thank you, city of Miami.

329
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:37,862
You're gonna kill him
in daylight?

330
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,597
Doesn't matter out this far.

331
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:42,034
It's still very risky.

332
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,268
What if someone comes by?

333
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:46,539
That could also happen
at night.

334
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:50,811
But it's a lot less likely.

335
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:53,046
You have to do this right,
Dexter.

336
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,681
It's important.

337
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:56,616
It's your first kill since...

338
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,551
you don't have to tell me
how much I need this.

339
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:00,519
That's the problem.

340
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:01,887
What?

341
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:04,022
This kill won't put
everything right.

342
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,258
It won't bring Rita back.

343
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,326
It might bring me back.

344
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,195
If you make it mean so much,
you'll only invite mistakes.

345
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,830
I won't make any mistakes.

346
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,065
I'm following the code.

347
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,634
Are you gonna help me or not?

348
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:20,138
I only want to help you, Dex.

349
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,207
This is a big room.

350
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,777
I hope you brought
enough plastic.

351
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:34,154
It feels good getting
the details right.

352
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:37,491
It's more than just preparing
a kill room.

353
00:17:56,213 --> 00:18:00,183
It's like I'm putting
my life back in order.

354
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:10,160
And it's almost enough.

355
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:12,997
Almost.

356
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:17,601
If anyone knows
about these murders, it's Fauzi.

357
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:22,441
He knows everybody
in this neighborhood.

358
00:18:22,475 --> 00:18:24,576
You really grew up around here?

359
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:26,445
You make it sound
like a disability.

360
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,813
I'm asking a question.

361
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:30,616
I'm not about to burn a cross.

362
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,718
I used to ride my bike
around this block.

363
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:34,386
There was this mean dog
that lived there.

364
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,755
I mean, I used to pray to Saint
Anthony to make me invisible.

365
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,057
I never got bit.

366
00:18:38,091 --> 00:18:39,625
You think prayer
was the reason?

367
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:41,127
Yeah.

368
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,563
That and some homemade
pepper spray.

369
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,792
I was surprised you called.

370
00:19:11,826 --> 00:19:13,460
Thought you didn't believe
what I said at the crime scene.

371
00:19:13,494 --> 00:19:16,329
Who says I do?

372
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,565
At this point, you can't
rule anything out.

373
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,968
Well, bringing me in was
the best move, Detective.

374
00:19:21,002 --> 00:19:23,103
You won't be sorry.

375
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:49,898
Ask him if he's heard of the deaths of Mr.
and Mrs. Alfaro.

376
00:19:57,007 --> 00:20:01,510
This was found
at the crime scene.

377
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:02,811
Did he sell it to Mr. Alfaro?

378
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:17,226
He says Alfaro
was a strict catholic.

379
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,562
Came in to the store now
and then to buy some things,

380
00:20:19,596 --> 00:20:21,397
but he wouldn't have been
caught dead back here.

381
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:23,132
Did he sell it to anyone else?

382
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:33,275
He says he doesn't keep track
of who buys what,

383
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,144
and he doesn't even believe
in this shit.

384
00:20:35,178 --> 00:20:37,779
Is that why he has the tattoo?

385
00:20:37,814 --> 00:20:42,050
I got drunk one night,
woke up, it was there.

386
00:20:42,084 --> 00:20:46,887
You tell me.

387
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:55,896
Hey, hey.
We were doing great in English.

388
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,431
You live in Miami.

389
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,932
Why you no learn Spanish?

390
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:03,905
Because me too busy
making a living.

391
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:06,241
Is there anything else
you can tell us?

392
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:08,711
Anything that will help us
with this case?

393
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:15,283
Fauzi's holding back.

394
00:21:15,318 --> 00:21:17,118
I should have talked
to him by myself.

395
00:21:17,153 --> 00:21:18,453
Might have been
in a more sharing mood

396
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,088
with someone he knows.
Oh, yeah?

397
00:21:20,122 --> 00:21:21,255
Maybe he would have
said nothing

398
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,293
like everyone else
in this neighborhood.

399
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,294
Hey, I know you're
up against it,

400
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,563
but you might just want
to take a breath.

401
00:21:34,468 --> 00:21:36,469
Why don't we give him the night
to stew over this

402
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,904
and then you come
visit him tomorrow alone?

403
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:41,907
Fine.

404
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:04,929
Sonya?

405
00:22:04,963 --> 00:22:06,964
Sonya?

406
00:22:10,302 --> 00:22:13,203
Where are they?

407
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:17,607
Hi, this is sonya.
Leave a message.

408
00:22:17,642 --> 00:22:18,808
Yeah, it's Dexter.

409
00:22:18,843 --> 00:22:21,344
I just got back and you're not
here and not answering your cell.

410
00:22:21,378 --> 00:22:23,212
Call me now.

411
00:22:23,246 --> 00:22:24,713
Can't help but think the worst.

412
00:22:24,747 --> 00:22:25,881
Harrison's been stolen.

413
00:22:25,915 --> 00:22:28,851
I shouldn't have left him
with a stranger.

414
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:33,588
Rita would have never
allowed it.

415
00:22:33,623 --> 00:22:34,656
Hi.

416
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:40,228
Finally fallen asleep.

417
00:22:40,263 --> 00:22:41,763
Where were you?

418
00:22:41,797 --> 00:22:44,099
<i>Well, he was keyed up after
his yo gabba gabba videos.</i>

419
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:46,902
I thought some fresh air
would make him drowsy.

420
00:22:46,936 --> 00:22:48,937
It worked.

421
00:22:48,971 --> 00:22:50,238
You didn't answer your cell.

422
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:54,108
Well, I had my hands full.

423
00:22:54,143 --> 00:22:56,912
Oh, I left a note
on the fridge.

424
00:22:56,946 --> 00:23:00,249
Oh, I didn't mean to worry you.

425
00:23:00,283 --> 00:23:01,717
No, it's fine.

426
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:03,686
I'm just...

427
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,988
I'm not used to checking
the fridge for notes.

428
00:23:06,022 --> 00:23:08,424
Just messages
from other serial killers.

429
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:11,627
Oh, I feel terrible.

430
00:23:11,661 --> 00:23:13,362
Don't.
You were just doing your job.

431
00:23:13,396 --> 00:23:15,965
Hey, I'm lucky to have you.

432
00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:20,202
We both are.

433
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:30,879
Oh, a little courtesy, please.

434
00:23:30,913 --> 00:23:35,383
Thanks.

435
00:23:35,418 --> 00:23:39,754
You hitting the club tonight?

436
00:23:39,788 --> 00:23:40,755
No.
Home.

437
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:42,290
Oh, good.

438
00:23:42,324 --> 00:23:44,158
'Cause I won't be there
to watch your back.

439
00:23:44,193 --> 00:23:46,594
There could be wingmen out there
looking to settle the score.

440
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:48,362
Just drop it.

441
00:23:48,397 --> 00:23:52,466
With all due respect, this man
is a knight in shining armor.

442
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,802
You should be polishing
his Lance.

443
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:58,138
Excuse me?

444
00:23:58,173 --> 00:24:01,075
I meant that metaphorically.

445
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:04,177
Not...How it sounded.

446
00:24:07,215 --> 00:24:10,217
Good night.

447
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:20,560
Okay, I want to know exactly
what happened at the bar.

448
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:24,196
I told you it's settled.

449
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:30,202
I'm not asking as your wife.

450
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:33,806
Vince and I were having
drinks, keeping to ourselves.

451
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,509
And then out of the blue, sergeant
Lopez starts talking shit.

452
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:38,377
What shit?

453
00:24:38,412 --> 00:24:40,579
You know...Shit.
He was out of line.

454
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:43,715
Specifics.

455
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,956
He asked if you
and I were married.

456
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,728
Then he said you were
a fine piece of ass.

457
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:57,897
And you were my sugar mama.

458
00:24:57,931 --> 00:24:59,098
Sugar mama?

459
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:02,100
Yeah, 'cause you're my boss and
your paycheck has more zeros.

460
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:03,569
Does that really bother you?

461
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:04,804
A little.

462
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,938
Do you know any guys
it wouldn't bother?

463
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:08,774
So you hit him?

464
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:09,875
No, there's more.

465
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:11,076
More?

466
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,079
You wanted to know everything.

467
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:19,318
He then said you gave
the best blowjobs in Miami.

468
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:25,223
And then I hit him.

469
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:30,061
And he's lucky that's
all I did.

470
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:39,271
Angel, I'm a woman
in a position of power.

471
00:25:39,306 --> 00:25:41,908
Some men have trouble
dealing with that,

472
00:25:41,942 --> 00:25:43,276
so they spread garbage around.

473
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:47,815
I know.
I know.

474
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:52,186
And I'm trying
to work through it.

475
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,189
Could you work through
it without the bar fights?

476
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:58,058
I'll keep the bar fights
at a minimum.

477
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:06,467
He sleeping?

478
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:12,173
Like a baby.

479
00:26:12,207 --> 00:26:14,809
How was work?

480
00:26:14,843 --> 00:26:16,745
Dire.

481
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:19,882
I've been saddled with
this uniform on a homicide case

482
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:23,486
and she's driving me
ape-ass crazy.

483
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,321
How's the nanny?

484
00:26:25,356 --> 00:26:28,692
Aside from a little
message hiccup...

485
00:26:28,726 --> 00:26:32,495
it was totally my fault...
she did great.

486
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,732
I wonder why she left Ireland.

487
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:37,700
Maybe she's running
from something.

488
00:26:37,735 --> 00:26:38,834
I don't know, Deb.

489
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:42,938
Maybe you better check
interpol.

490
00:26:42,973 --> 00:26:44,973
What about you?
What'd you do today?

491
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:46,241
Not much.

492
00:26:46,275 --> 00:26:48,276
Cody called.

493
00:26:48,311 --> 00:26:51,813
He wanted me to send
my recipe for pancakes.

494
00:26:51,848 --> 00:26:53,582
How are they?

495
00:26:53,617 --> 00:27:00,422
Cody sounds...
Happier.

496
00:27:00,457 --> 00:27:02,358
Astor wouldn't come
to the phone.

497
00:27:02,393 --> 00:27:07,865
She'll come around, Dex.

498
00:27:07,899 --> 00:27:10,235
Well, other than that,
I ran some errands.

499
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:13,138
That's good.

500
00:27:13,172 --> 00:27:15,206
Get back in your routine.

501
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,009
When you lose someone close,
routine can be a ladder

502
00:27:18,044 --> 00:27:20,679
that can help you climb back
into some kind of normalcy.

503
00:27:25,118 --> 00:27:26,552
Where'd you hear that?

504
00:27:26,586 --> 00:27:31,524
I am capable of independent
thought, Dexter.

505
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:33,059
Oprah.

506
00:27:34,228 --> 00:27:36,396
I watched her
when I was laid up.

507
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,298
That's good.

508
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:42,469
Keep getting better, Dex.

509
00:27:42,504 --> 00:27:46,040
I'll try.

510
00:27:46,074 --> 00:27:51,479
Yeah, I'd like to report
a dead animal.

511
00:27:51,513 --> 00:27:55,916
Uh, county road 5,
mile marker 31.

512
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,984
I'm not sure.

513
00:27:57,018 --> 00:27:58,752
I think it was a gator.

514
00:27:58,786 --> 00:28:01,855
It was long and scaly.

515
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:06,859
Yeah.
Thank you.

516
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:10,162
It's on Boyd's circuit,
so he'll get the call.

517
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:11,997
When he does, Boyd will
take a little nap

518
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:15,000
and wake up in the tourist
welcome center,

519
00:28:15,034 --> 00:28:18,269
but he won't be collecting
any brochures.

520
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:22,141
Wasn't sure you'd be here.

521
00:28:22,175 --> 00:28:23,309
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

522
00:28:23,343 --> 00:28:25,745
Hey, I'm a safety guy.

523
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:28,681
Right.

524
00:28:28,716 --> 00:28:31,451
Never be too safe.

525
00:28:31,485 --> 00:28:32,986
Where we off to first?

526
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,589
Dead cat on Lindgren.
Boring.

527
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:38,358
Pretty neighborhood though.

528
00:28:38,392 --> 00:28:42,295
Lot of trophy wives out
jogging at this hour.

529
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,497
There's a bonus.

530
00:28:44,532 --> 00:28:46,600
You have to embrace the now.

531
00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:50,136
Every second you waste is one more
second you'll never get back.

532
00:28:50,171 --> 00:28:51,638
Ever hear this guy?

533
00:28:51,672 --> 00:28:53,373
When I was searching
your house.

534
00:28:53,407 --> 00:28:54,941
Changed my life.

535
00:28:54,976 --> 00:28:58,178
Really helped me see
what's important.

536
00:28:58,212 --> 00:28:59,480
Do the same for you.

537
00:28:59,514 --> 00:29:03,150
Ease you through that divorce.

538
00:29:03,184 --> 00:29:05,285
Divorce?

539
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,554
Ring dent.

540
00:29:07,588 --> 00:29:10,390
I didn't want Boyd
to know that part of my life.

541
00:29:10,424 --> 00:29:12,927
For a roadkill janitor,
he doesn't miss much.

542
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,829
Hope it's not a touchy subject.

543
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:17,899
No, it just didn't work out.

544
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:22,204
If you need help moving
on, listen to these CDs.

545
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:25,041
- Take it.
- Take it now.

546
00:29:25,076 --> 00:29:27,611
That's the main idea.

547
00:29:27,646 --> 00:29:29,347
Take it now?

548
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:32,917
There's more to it than that, but
it really makes a difference.

549
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:37,555
Of course, you got to know
what it is you want to take.

550
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:44,696
What is it you want, Daryl?

551
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,398
That's kind of a
hard question to answer.

552
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:49,200
Yes, it is.

553
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:52,836
But I really think it's what
we're on this earth to find out.

554
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:21,229
Justin Bieber.

555
00:30:21,263 --> 00:30:23,765
Not that I know who that is.

556
00:30:29,773 --> 00:30:32,241
I know who purchased
the Santa Muerte icons

557
00:30:32,276 --> 00:30:33,876
and it wasn't our dead husband.

558
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,944
Fauzi talked?

559
00:30:34,978 --> 00:30:36,713
I was right.
He was holding back.

560
00:30:36,747 --> 00:30:38,081
What'd you get?

561
00:30:38,115 --> 00:30:39,783
No names, but a description.

562
00:30:39,817 --> 00:30:41,585
2 guys in their 30s,
strong accents,

563
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,289
possibly recent immigrants
from Venezuela.

564
00:30:44,323 --> 00:30:46,291
Criminal types.
Those were his words.

565
00:30:46,325 --> 00:30:49,762
And big into Santa Muerte.

566
00:30:49,796 --> 00:30:51,863
What if Alfaro
isn't freaked out

567
00:30:51,898 --> 00:30:53,765
because he just murdered
his wife?

568
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:57,102
What if he's freaked out because
someone's got his wife?

569
00:30:57,136 --> 00:30:59,738
And they'll kill her unless
he pays cash.

570
00:30:59,773 --> 00:31:01,440
This isn't drug related.

571
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:04,643
Maybe she was fucking
held hostage for ransom.

572
00:31:04,677 --> 00:31:06,979
You think Fauzi spilled
everything he knows?

573
00:31:07,013 --> 00:31:08,213
He's been asking
around the neighborhood.

574
00:31:08,247 --> 00:31:09,414
Thinks he can dig up some more.

575
00:31:09,448 --> 00:31:11,649
Well, let's fucking find out.

576
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:15,485
Sometimes it gets so hot,
these things

577
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,788
actually start frying.
And you got to...

578
00:31:18,822 --> 00:31:21,824
you got to scrape 'em off
like diner food.

579
00:31:21,858 --> 00:31:24,426
Two hours and no call
about my gator.

580
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,227
They must have sent
someone else.

581
00:31:26,262 --> 00:31:27,795
God almighty.

582
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,997
That stink gets in your soul.

583
00:31:30,032 --> 00:31:32,499
Which means this kill is dead.

584
00:31:32,534 --> 00:31:35,035
Man, you got a nose of steel.

585
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,137
You're made for this job.

586
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:40,742
Now I'm stuck with Boyd.

587
00:31:43,512 --> 00:31:46,548
So much for getting
my life back.

588
00:31:53,457 --> 00:31:56,593
It's almost lunch time.

589
00:31:56,627 --> 00:31:58,862
I usually eat at home
by myself,

590
00:31:58,896 --> 00:32:01,365
but there's a Chinese place
not too far.

591
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:05,102
Hang on.

592
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:07,939
Boyd.

593
00:32:07,974 --> 00:32:10,175
Maybe the universe
is showing mercy on me.

594
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,444
What's the location?

595
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:14,380
I'm on it.

596
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:15,949
What's up?

597
00:32:15,983 --> 00:32:18,551
Dead gator out on county five.

598
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:20,587
First promising thing all day.

599
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:23,055
But if you're starving, we can
push it till after lunch.

600
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,056
I'm good.

601
00:32:24,091 --> 00:32:25,958
Then let's rumble.

602
00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:31,029
Gator runs can get hairy.

603
00:32:31,064 --> 00:32:32,865
You got to be on your toes.

604
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:34,366
Hairy how?

605
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:37,136
Can't always tell
if they're really dead.

606
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:39,239
Yikes.

607
00:32:39,273 --> 00:32:44,812
Don't worry. Like I said...
I'm a safety guy.

608
00:32:44,846 --> 00:32:47,848
Must be at lunch.

609
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:09,371
Hello?

610
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:11,405
Hello?

611
00:33:17,845 --> 00:33:20,814
Shit.

612
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:24,283
Detective.

613
00:33:24,318 --> 00:33:26,318
Call it in.

614
00:33:28,388 --> 00:33:30,188
Do it.

615
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:33,225
This is officer Manzon.

616
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:58,252
Mile marker should
be right around here.

617
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,787
Be careful.

618
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:01,122
Sucker could be anywhere.

619
00:34:01,156 --> 00:34:03,758
You really don't
want to step on it.

620
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:11,666
Finally...
It's right.

621
00:34:19,074 --> 00:34:22,076
Shit.

622
00:34:39,461 --> 00:34:41,861
Where am I?

623
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:44,497
On your way to county medical.

624
00:34:44,531 --> 00:34:45,931
You know what city you're in?

625
00:34:45,966 --> 00:34:47,700
Miami.

626
00:34:47,734 --> 00:34:50,702
What day is it?

627
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:52,571
Wednesday.
What happened to me?

628
00:34:52,605 --> 00:34:54,573
A motorist spotted you lying
on the side of the road,

629
00:34:54,607 --> 00:34:56,708
called 911.

630
00:34:56,743 --> 00:35:01,113
Seems this guy shot you
with a tranq dart.

631
00:35:01,147 --> 00:35:02,681
Boys have an argument
or something?

632
00:35:02,715 --> 00:35:05,717
No.
No.

633
00:35:05,752 --> 00:35:08,955
Went off by accident.

634
00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:11,924
Crazy asshole, you were
supposed to shoot the gator.

635
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:16,463
You got in my way,
you fucking numbskull.

636
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:17,864
So what's your excuse?

637
00:35:17,898 --> 00:35:19,032
Huh?

638
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:20,300
Why were you unconscious?

639
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:24,304
They must not have found
my needle.

640
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:28,175
I guess I was just so upset
that I passed out.

641
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,576
There's one piece of good luck.

642
00:35:29,611 --> 00:35:31,778
I really need
to get back to my truck.

643
00:35:31,813 --> 00:35:33,046
Yeah, sorry.

644
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:34,548
I can't let you jump out
of a moving ambulance.

645
00:35:34,582 --> 00:35:35,683
We'll be there soon.

646
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,285
Need to get you both
checked over.

647
00:35:46,427 --> 00:35:49,929
Got him.

648
00:35:49,963 --> 00:35:51,564
Dropping it.

649
00:35:51,598 --> 00:35:54,300
Let's go.

650
00:35:54,334 --> 00:35:56,301
Let's go on three.

651
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:25,128
Chart.

652
00:36:25,162 --> 00:36:26,596
I'm Dr. lorre.

653
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,699
I understand you suffered
a loss of consciousness.

654
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:30,367
That's what I'm told.

655
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:31,802
That ever happen before?

656
00:36:31,836 --> 00:36:35,006
Um...First time.

657
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,775
You have any history of headaches,
dizziness, blurred vision?

658
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:38,976
- Uh-uh.

659
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,510
Hypoglycemia?

660
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:41,678
Not that I know of.

661
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:43,414
Okay.

662
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:44,815
We're gonna run a chem profile

663
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:47,518
and check your glucose levels
for possible dehydration.

664
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:49,621
We'll follow up
with a tox screen.

665
00:36:49,655 --> 00:36:52,723
See if anything's
in your system.

666
00:36:52,758 --> 00:36:54,391
I'll be right back
to draw your blood.

667
00:36:54,426 --> 00:36:56,793
Just lie still.

668
00:37:49,277 --> 00:37:50,710
He's in there, okay.

669
00:37:50,745 --> 00:37:52,712
Just give him aspirin.
No painkillers.

670
00:37:52,747 --> 00:37:53,814
I'm sorry, doctor.

671
00:37:53,848 --> 00:37:55,415
I didn't know
about his addiction.

672
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,617
Well, you got to check the
patient's records here, he's...

673
00:37:57,652 --> 00:37:59,786
fifth time he's been
in the E.R. this year.

674
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:00,921
This is his fifth accident.

675
00:38:00,955 --> 00:38:01,989
It won't happen again.

676
00:38:02,023 --> 00:38:06,794
All right.

677
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:15,170
Another head?

678
00:38:15,204 --> 00:38:18,340
And I was in such a good mood.

679
00:38:22,744 --> 00:38:24,245
It's my fault.

680
00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:26,180
I got him killed.

681
00:38:26,214 --> 00:38:28,182
Fuck that.
You didn't cut his head off.

682
00:38:28,216 --> 00:38:31,485
They did this because
he started talking to me.

683
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,556
If I hadn't come back here,
Fauzi would still be alive.

684
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,791
It was my call.

685
00:38:36,825 --> 00:38:39,126
We're in this together.

686
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,163
And we're closer to catching him
because of you, okay?

687
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:44,165
You did good.

688
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,534
Looks like, uh...

689
00:38:46,569 --> 00:38:50,272
The same treatment
as our other, uh, head case.

690
00:38:53,443 --> 00:38:55,745
Eyes and tongue
have been excised.

691
00:38:55,779 --> 00:38:58,347
Damn, don't people just shoot
each other anymore?

692
00:39:01,184 --> 00:39:03,019
Excuse me a sec.

693
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:07,523
Hey, thanks
for calling me back.

694
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:10,393
No prob.
Sorry it took so long.

695
00:39:10,427 --> 00:39:11,995
We're up to our necks
on this trinity thing.

696
00:39:12,029 --> 00:39:14,397
Yeah, that's what I want
to talk to you about.

697
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,466
I think I may have
a lead on Kyle Butler.

698
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:18,002
Kyle Butler?

699
00:39:18,036 --> 00:39:19,570
Yeah, you know,
the guy who was hanging around

700
00:39:19,604 --> 00:39:20,571
with Arthur Mitchell?

701
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:21,872
Yeah, I know who he is.

702
00:39:21,906 --> 00:39:24,008
Just didn't know you people
were working this.

703
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:26,778
I'm sort of, uh,
flying off the record.

704
00:39:26,812 --> 00:39:28,113
Listen.

705
00:39:28,147 --> 00:39:30,515
Is there any chance I could talk
to the Mitchell family?

706
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,050
The Mitchells are
in a safe house.

707
00:39:32,085 --> 00:39:33,518
First stop before
Witness Protection.

708
00:39:33,552 --> 00:39:34,819
Just want to show them a photo.

709
00:39:34,854 --> 00:39:37,522
Take five minutes.

710
00:39:37,556 --> 00:39:39,223
Give me the photo.
I'll show it to them.

711
00:39:39,258 --> 00:39:41,925
Ahh, it's too sensitive.

712
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,460
If I'm wrong,
it could mean my ass.

713
00:39:43,494 --> 00:39:48,898
Come on...
Ray, as a friend.

714
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:52,135
I'll see what I can do,
but no promises.

715
00:39:52,169 --> 00:39:53,603
Thanks.

716
00:39:53,638 --> 00:39:55,272
Let me know.

717
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,636
Take it.

718
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:56,172
Now, before you can take anything...
What the fuck?

719
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:58,207
You have to know
what it is you want.

720
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:00,910
May sound easy, but you
can't know what you want

721
00:41:00,944 --> 00:41:02,745
unless you know yourself.

722
00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:06,148
But if you want something,
there's only one option.

723
00:41:06,183 --> 00:41:08,651
Take it.

724
00:41:08,685 --> 00:41:09,986
You want that promotion?

725
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,721
Well, then take it.

726
00:41:12,756 --> 00:41:14,790
You want that new car,
that house?

727
00:41:14,825 --> 00:41:15,792
Take it.

728
00:41:20,497 --> 00:41:25,267
That could have gone smoother.

729
00:41:25,302 --> 00:41:28,070
Could have also gone worse.

730
00:41:28,105 --> 00:41:30,073
Least he's down.

731
00:41:41,121 --> 00:41:42,788
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Dexter.

732
00:41:42,822 --> 00:41:44,423
Wanted to tell you
that I'm gonna

733
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:45,692
be a little later
than I expected.

734
00:41:45,726 --> 00:41:46,960
It's no problem.

735
00:41:46,994 --> 00:41:48,995
My sister should
be there any minute though.

736
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:51,431
Actually, she phoned too.
She's tied up at work.

737
00:41:51,465 --> 00:41:53,800
- Oh.
- It's okay.

738
00:41:53,835 --> 00:41:55,135
I don't mind staying late.

739
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,170
I... I like watching him sleep.

740
00:41:57,204 --> 00:41:58,472
You're a lifesaver.

741
00:41:58,506 --> 00:42:00,107
I was gonna call you.

742
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:01,374
Is everything okay?

743
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:03,377
He took his first step.

744
00:42:03,411 --> 00:42:06,680
At least I think
it was his first.

745
00:42:06,715 --> 00:42:07,948
He did?

746
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,483
It was only one step,
but you could tell

747
00:42:09,518 --> 00:42:11,786
he was really proud of himself.

748
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,989
That's amazing.

749
00:42:15,023 --> 00:42:16,457
I managed
to get a shot for you.

750
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,793
Check your email.

751
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,028
Thanks.

752
00:42:19,062 --> 00:42:20,896
I'll call you when
I'm on my way home.

753
00:42:29,641 --> 00:42:35,212
My son is walking...
Like a normal little boy.

754
00:42:42,553 --> 00:42:44,354
I'm on my way there right now.

755
00:42:44,388 --> 00:42:46,689
Just start trolling
for eyewitnesses.

756
00:42:46,723 --> 00:42:48,023
Maybe we'll catch a break.

757
00:42:48,057 --> 00:42:49,892
Maybe someone
saw something, okay?

758
00:42:49,926 --> 00:42:51,526
- Lieutenant Laguerta?
- Yes?

759
00:42:51,561 --> 00:42:53,128
Jim McCourt, internal affairs.

760
00:42:53,162 --> 00:42:56,330
I wonder if I could have
a word with you in private?

761
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,366
Of course.

762
00:43:03,137 --> 00:43:06,239
So...What's this about?

763
00:43:06,273 --> 00:43:08,474
Well, this is really
a courtesy call.

764
00:43:08,509 --> 00:43:10,376
We're about to launch
a formal investigation

765
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:14,113
into one of your detectives...
a...Angel Batista.

766
00:43:14,147 --> 00:43:16,081
I understand he's your husband.

767
00:43:16,115 --> 00:43:18,116
Yes.
Yes, he is.

768
00:43:18,151 --> 00:43:20,185
Apparently, he had
a physical altercation

769
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,289
with one of his fellow officers...
a sergeant Lopez.

770
00:43:23,323 --> 00:43:26,625
I was under the impression
the matter was settled.

771
00:43:26,659 --> 00:43:27,993
Oh, far from it.

772
00:43:28,027 --> 00:43:29,528
Lopez collapsed
while on duty today.

773
00:43:29,562 --> 00:43:32,531
He's been hospitalized
with internal bleeding.

774
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:33,699
My God.

775
00:43:33,733 --> 00:43:37,102
We believe that he'll pull
through, but he's filed charges.

776
00:43:37,137 --> 00:43:40,105
Something else you
should be aware of:

777
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,375
We have two eyewitnesses
who claim that they saw Batista

778
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:45,544
kick sergeant Lopez
while on the ground.

779
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:49,448
Now, if that is true, that is
assault with a deadly weapon

780
00:43:49,482 --> 00:43:54,954
and he could not only lose his job...
He could serve time.

781
00:44:21,046 --> 00:44:22,646
Had to borrow this from you.

782
00:44:22,681 --> 00:44:25,382
I hope you don't mind.

783
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:26,583
What the hell?

784
00:44:26,618 --> 00:44:35,825
Normally, I bring my own plastic, but...
I had to... improvise.

785
00:44:37,595 --> 00:44:38,995
Let me the fuck out of here.

786
00:44:39,029 --> 00:44:40,897
I bet you've heard
that before...

787
00:44:40,932 --> 00:44:44,267
"Let me out of here"... from
all the women you've killed.

788
00:44:49,907 --> 00:44:54,812
I wish you could see
the room I set up for you.

789
00:44:54,846 --> 00:44:56,981
But you fucked
everything up, Boyd.

790
00:45:03,023 --> 00:45:06,860
All those pictures I took
of the women you killed.

791
00:45:06,894 --> 00:45:10,196
It's a shame you'll never
get to see them.

792
00:45:15,503 --> 00:45:20,241
I'll just have to paint
a word-picture for you instead.

793
00:45:20,275 --> 00:45:22,610
They were young.

794
00:45:22,644 --> 00:45:25,612
Just starting their lives.

795
00:45:25,646 --> 00:45:27,247
Now they're floating
in formaldehyde

796
00:45:27,282 --> 00:45:31,017
and stuffed into barrels strewn
around a swamp.

797
00:45:31,052 --> 00:45:32,652
Who the hell are you?

798
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:37,957
Just a fellow traveler who...

799
00:45:37,991 --> 00:45:40,225
Also likes to pick up
dead animals.

800
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:43,328
I did 'em a favor.

801
00:45:43,362 --> 00:45:48,866
They were all suffering and I
put 'em out of their misery.

802
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:52,803
Yeah, you'll be doing
one more favor tonight.

803
00:45:52,837 --> 00:45:56,073
What are you talking about?

804
00:45:56,107 --> 00:45:59,276
I've recently suffered a loss.

805
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:05,281
My wife...
was murdered by someone like you.

806
00:46:05,316 --> 00:46:07,551
Someone like me.

807
00:46:07,585 --> 00:46:10,587
It turned my life upside down.

808
00:46:10,621 --> 00:46:12,522
Why is it my problem?

809
00:46:12,556 --> 00:46:15,758
Because you're the start
of my healing process.

810
00:46:15,792 --> 00:46:21,763
I knew you were fucked up the
minute I laid eyes on you.

811
00:46:21,797 --> 00:46:24,298
I was fucked up long
before that.

812
00:46:24,332 --> 00:46:26,266
You don't know
what you're getting into.

813
00:46:26,301 --> 00:46:31,471
Remember in the truck
you asked me what I want?

814
00:46:31,505 --> 00:46:39,246
I want my wife back...
But this will have to do.

815
00:46:53,329 --> 00:46:54,997
No church bells.

816
00:46:55,031 --> 00:46:56,899
No hallelujah chorus.

817
00:46:56,933 --> 00:47:00,002
Nothing feels different.

818
00:47:00,036 --> 00:47:02,604
If anything, I'm emptier.

819
00:47:23,493 --> 00:47:24,960
It's okay.

820
00:47:24,995 --> 00:47:29,631
I'm not gonna hurt you.

821
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:33,335
It's okay.
Here.

822
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:35,972
No, don't.
Don't.

823
00:47:36,006 --> 00:47:37,173
Stop.

824
00:47:37,207 --> 00:47:39,209
No.

825
00:47:45,383 --> 00:47:47,317
She saw everything.

826
00:47:49,921 --> 00:47:53,557
She saw...me.

827
