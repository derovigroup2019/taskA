2
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:49,097
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:51,766
You were face-to-face
with Carlos Fuentes, right?

4
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:54,736
So that means he knows
that we're on to him.

5
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,604
Tell me why they would ever
return to this club.

6
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:58,473
You have one more night
at Club Mayan.

7
00:01:58,507 --> 00:02:01,743
Make something happen.

8
00:02:01,777 --> 00:02:03,812
This is Yasmin Aragon.

9
00:02:03,846 --> 00:02:05,947
If we agree to drop
her drug charges,

10
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:09,417
she thinks she can get the
Fuentes brothers in the club.

11
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:10,752
Hey.

12
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:12,387
I thought you might
want a debriefing

13
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:14,656
before we hit Club Mayan.

14
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,492
Um, it's sort of not
a good time.

15
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:18,993
This is Stan Liddy.

16
00:02:19,028 --> 00:02:21,763
You are boning
our target's sister?

17
00:02:21,797 --> 00:02:24,399
Just tell me what you found
out on Dexter Morgan.

18
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:26,601
You fucked everything up, Boyd.

19
00:02:26,635 --> 00:02:28,770
Boyd Fowler.
Hobbies:

20
00:02:28,804 --> 00:02:31,106
- Self-improvement...
- Take it!

21
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,541
And storing women in
formaldehyde.

22
00:02:33,576 --> 00:02:35,844
Every one of these barrels
has a body in it.

23
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:38,179
Boyd wasn't the only one who
did this to me.

24
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:39,314
There were others.

25
00:02:39,348 --> 00:02:40,782
I shot one of them.

26
00:02:40,816 --> 00:02:42,183
Dexter, what do I do?

27
00:02:42,218 --> 00:02:46,187
That last fucking bitch
is alive.

28
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:49,491
They're gonna find you.

29
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:52,260
Some experiences are so big
they change your DNA.

30
00:02:52,294 --> 00:02:53,995
I'm gonna have to find
the rest of them,

31
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:56,898
because that's the only way that
I can feel this peace again.

32
00:02:56,932 --> 00:02:59,467
I can't get revenge
for Rita's death,

33
00:02:59,502 --> 00:03:03,138
but I can help Lumen avenge
what was done to her.

34
00:03:03,172 --> 00:03:05,173
How many more were there?

35
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:20,221
It's been over a month since
I freed Lumen from Boyd's,

36
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:22,223
but she's still
reliving it every day.

37
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:24,826
Hey.
I brought food.

38
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,662
Oh.

39
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,567
Have you eaten?

40
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:34,135
I ate this morning.

41
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,638
Well, now it's night.

42
00:03:36,672 --> 00:03:40,175
Eat some more.

43
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:42,877
You're very...Controlling.

44
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:44,879
When I need to be.

45
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:52,253
So what else?

46
00:03:52,288 --> 00:03:56,925
Details would help.

47
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,328
Besides the ones
that we've already...

48
00:04:00,362 --> 00:04:02,597
Taken care of...

49
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:03,832
There was watch guy.

50
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:06,201
"Watch guy"?

51
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:11,072
I would be tied
to a chair...blindfolded.

52
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:13,374
Sometimes I didn't even know
if he was there

53
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:18,246
until I'd hear this watch
by my ear.

54
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,615
And then he'd lean in
and whisper,

55
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,685
"Tick, tick, tick.

56
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:28,590
That's the sound of your life
running out."

57
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:33,261
Okay.
Anyone else?

58
00:04:33,295 --> 00:04:36,397
Suit and tie.

59
00:04:36,432 --> 00:04:39,901
He'd take off his jacket
and fold it

60
00:04:39,935 --> 00:04:42,937
very carefully
and then lay it on a chair,

61
00:04:42,972 --> 00:04:45,273
like he didn't
want to mess it up.

62
00:04:48,077 --> 00:04:49,310
The suit guy I'd know.

63
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:53,581
He always took
the blindfold off.

64
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:55,650
I guess he thought
I'd be dead soon.

65
00:04:55,684 --> 00:04:57,652
He was wrong.

66
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:37,992
<i>Si?</i>

67
00:05:57,112 --> 00:05:58,947
So what do we do now?

68
00:05:58,981 --> 00:06:00,214
How do we find them?

69
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:02,216
I'm not sure "we" is
the operating word here.

70
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:04,519
What are you talking about?

71
00:06:04,553 --> 00:06:05,720
We're doing this together.

72
00:06:05,754 --> 00:06:08,156
Lumen, what I do, I do alone.

73
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,591
I don't need a partner.

74
00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:11,726
I said I'd help you, but...

75
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,495
Fine.
Forget it.

76
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,264
Forget it?

77
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:17,632
There's no point to it then.

78
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,901
You want these men
brought to justice.

79
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:23,504
Yeah, and I can't go
to the cops because of you.

80
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:28,276
So you're gonna have to be
a little flexible here.

81
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,481
I want to be a part of this.

82
00:06:33,515 --> 00:06:37,752
We'll see.

83
00:06:53,035 --> 00:06:56,004
<i>Gracias.</i>

84
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:14,322
I need to get home to Harrison.

85
00:07:14,356 --> 00:07:16,090
Right.

86
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,392
The other part of your life.

87
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:20,528
There is no other part
to Lumen's life.

88
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:24,032
This is all she has.

89
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:26,834
Even so, I can't bring her
into my world.

90
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:29,337
There's no place for her.

91
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:31,172
Dexter?

92
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:39,981
Thank you.

93
00:07:40,015 --> 00:07:44,318
I feel like I'm dropping off
my prom date.

94
00:07:44,353 --> 00:07:46,721
Except this is my house
and my wife is dead

95
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:48,589
and I have no idea where Lumen
fits into my world

96
00:07:48,624 --> 00:07:50,725
and this is all so weird.

97
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:56,898
Exactly like my prom.

98
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,744
Our level of national debt
is unsustainable.

99
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:15,283
...Where independent producers

100
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:18,419
are weighed down
by parasitic non-producers,

101
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:22,123
a Democratic president
and a Democratic congress.

102
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:28,563
? ?

103
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:31,099
You're just in time.

104
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:41,242
Hey, good night, buddy.

105
00:08:41,276 --> 00:08:44,112
Saint Brigid, circle us
with your light

106
00:08:44,146 --> 00:08:47,815
so that no darkness shall
overcome our world.

107
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,552
Sleep well, little one.

108
00:08:51,587 --> 00:08:53,821
That's either a Saint
or the most boring

109
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:55,289
action figure I've ever seen.

110
00:08:55,324 --> 00:08:57,191
Is that yours?

111
00:08:57,226 --> 00:09:02,630
It's Saint Brigid.

112
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:08,369
To watch over you
while you sleep.

113
00:09:12,274 --> 00:09:15,276
- Good night.
- Good night.

114
00:09:25,854 --> 00:09:28,990
He doesn't need Saint Brigid.

115
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:31,993
He has father Dexter.

116
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:39,534
Why are you up so early?

117
00:09:39,568 --> 00:09:44,205
Gym.

118
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,373
But how about it?

119
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:46,807
You know?

120
00:09:46,842 --> 00:09:48,943
I mean, we don't have
to live here.

121
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:50,311
We could get a new place
together.

122
00:09:56,718 --> 00:09:59,820
Morgan.

123
00:09:59,855 --> 00:10:00,888
I'm homicide.

124
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:03,891
I don't do traffic accidents.

125
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:05,359
Wow.

126
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:07,795
Uh, text me the address.

127
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:09,530
What's up?

128
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:10,831
Dead people.

129
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:11,866
You're gonna get the same call.

130
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,267
We're all getting called in.

131
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:14,669
Why didn't you tell them
I'm here?

132
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:18,239
Because I'm not here.

133
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:20,341
Basically, nobody knows
we're seeing each other.

134
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,877
I just want to keep it
that way.

135
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:27,014
Wow, baby.
You say the sweetest things.

136
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:28,649
Can we at least drive
in together?

137
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:30,651
Yeah, and then we'll go
to Disney World

138
00:10:30,686 --> 00:10:32,253
and we'll ride all
the roller coasters

139
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:36,524
and we'll hold hands.

140
00:10:36,558 --> 00:10:39,026
I don't even know
what that means.

141
00:10:50,272 --> 00:10:54,642
Whatever it is...
It's big.

142
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,217
- Dexter.
- Hey, sergeant.

143
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:05,319
What have we got?

144
00:11:05,354 --> 00:11:06,921
You haven't been listening
to the news?

145
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:08,756
Uh, weather channel.

146
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,294
High-pressure system
coming in.

147
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:14,729
What have we got?

148
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:24,071
We got her...
And her...

149
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:27,341
And her...
And her...

150
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:28,643
And her.

151
00:11:28,677 --> 00:11:32,146
The girls in the barrels.
How could this be?

152
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,349
Someone tried to move them.

153
00:11:35,384 --> 00:11:36,784
Where's the driver?

154
00:11:36,818 --> 00:11:37,852
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

155
00:11:37,886 --> 00:11:41,188
He took off.

156
00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:44,358
Go do your thing.

157
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:46,494
It's the blood guy,
but we got no blood.

158
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:47,762
We don't know what we've got.

159
00:11:47,796 --> 00:11:49,730
Yeah, what is this gunk?

160
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:52,767
It's formalin.
Liquid formaldehyde.

161
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:54,035
Why?

162
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:55,870
An embalming agent.

163
00:11:55,904 --> 00:11:57,471
Because it was only
applied topically,

164
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:59,173
the internal organs
of the cadavers

165
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:01,409
continued to putrefy and leak
out of the various

166
00:12:01,443 --> 00:12:03,611
bodily orifices,
becoming congealed

167
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:05,379
once they came in contact
with the formalin.

168
00:12:05,414 --> 00:12:06,614
That's what's on your shoe.

169
00:12:06,648 --> 00:12:10,584
Congealed organ.

170
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:11,919
What kind of sick fuck
are we dealing with?

171
00:12:11,953 --> 00:12:14,588
I'm just the blood guy.

172
00:12:14,623 --> 00:12:16,123
We've got five victims.

173
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:18,526
All female, all blonde,

174
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,028
all between the ages
of 20 and 35, I'm guessing.

175
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:23,931
They're covered in bruises,
contusions, whip marks.

176
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:27,168
Looks like they went through
some special kind of hell.

177
00:12:27,202 --> 00:12:28,869
We'll get fingerprints off them
once we get 'em

178
00:12:28,904 --> 00:12:30,471
to the M.E.'s office.

179
00:12:30,505 --> 00:12:32,073
I heard the driver took off.

180
00:12:32,107 --> 00:12:33,641
Yeah, we've got the guy
that hit him.

181
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:35,309
He was drunk off his
freaking ass.

182
00:12:35,344 --> 00:12:37,645
He said he saw some guy
jump out and start running,

183
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,780
but that's as detailed
as his description gets.

184
00:12:39,815 --> 00:12:40,948
"Some guy."

185
00:12:40,982 --> 00:12:44,418
That means he's still mine
to find.

186
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:50,758
Or Vince Masuka's.

187
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:51,959
Hey.

188
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:55,896
Hey, Dex.

189
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:57,765
That's some pretty crazy shit,
huh?

190
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,834
Yeah, crazy shit.
What do you got?

191
00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:03,104
Uh...

192
00:13:03,138 --> 00:13:07,041
One men's suit jacket, size 40.

193
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:09,610
Did you fold it
or was it already like that?

194
00:13:09,644 --> 00:13:12,913
I bagged it as I found it.

195
00:13:12,948 --> 00:13:14,682
I also got fingerprints galore.

196
00:13:14,716 --> 00:13:16,183
Excellent.

197
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:17,651
Except for the steering wheel.

198
00:13:17,686 --> 00:13:19,387
Somebody gave it a quick wipe.

199
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:21,222
I'll get the vehicle back
to the lab

200
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:23,190
and we'll give it a more
thorough going-over.

201
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:25,192
Right.

202
00:13:30,632 --> 00:13:36,036
So much for keeping
my lives separate.

203
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,108
Yeah, what's up?

204
00:13:41,143 --> 00:13:42,910
What you doing, boy?
Sleeping late?

205
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:44,545
Your buddy Dexter Morgan,
you asked me

206
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,313
- to keep an eye on him.
- Yeah?

207
00:13:46,348 --> 00:13:47,748
And?

208
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,350
Well, he's got some cutie up
at his house.

209
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:51,018
He even took down
the "for sale" sign.

210
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:53,187
What's this girl look like?

211
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:55,256
Blonde, average height,
late 20s.

212
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,991
Slim, pretty?

213
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:58,526
That'd be her.

214
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,693
Find out who she is.

215
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:01,295
You betcha.

216
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:02,696
Come here.

217
00:14:02,731 --> 00:14:03,898
What are you doing here?

218
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:05,733
I saw the news.

219
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:07,301
I knew what it was.
I had to come.

220
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:08,569
No, you didn't have to come.

221
00:14:08,603 --> 00:14:11,172
Dexter, I was supposed
to be one of those girls.

222
00:14:11,206 --> 00:14:13,274
Look, it's not safe
for you here.

223
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:14,508
They could be watching.

224
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:17,178
What is this?

225
00:14:17,212 --> 00:14:18,179
What does it mean?

226
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:20,080
It means they're on the run.

227
00:14:20,115 --> 00:14:22,049
You need to go.

228
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:35,396
Will you give me...
Thank you.

229
00:14:43,605 --> 00:14:45,139
Shit a brick
and fuck me with it.

230
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:48,676
You're never gonna guess who
this truck is registered to.

231
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,712
Jordan Chase.

232
00:14:51,746 --> 00:14:56,750
Jordan Chase
is a very smart guy.

233
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:58,953
His first book made me realize

234
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:01,722
how I'd been putting all these
limitations on myself.

235
00:15:01,756 --> 00:15:05,092
I mean, I've listened
to all his CDs.

236
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:06,894
So did Boyd Fowler.

237
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:09,463
You think Jordan could have been
driving that truck?

238
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:10,531
What?

239
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:12,166
No way.

240
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,702
First off, that jacket is nice,

241
00:15:14,736 --> 00:15:16,537
but not that nice.

242
00:15:16,571 --> 00:15:18,906
Jordan wears nothing
but the best.

243
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,908
That's part of his thing.

244
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:23,110
If you think you deserve
something,

245
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:27,982
then take it.

246
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:31,151
I've lifted two dozen
fingerprints

247
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:33,921
and they all seem to belong
to the same person.

248
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:35,890
And whoever they belong to,

249
00:15:35,924 --> 00:15:39,226
he's not in the AFIS database.

250
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:42,096
Dead end.

251
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:45,132
Ooh, a hair.

252
00:15:50,872 --> 00:15:53,073
And another one.

253
00:15:55,844 --> 00:15:59,113
It's not often I'm in
competition with my own people,

254
00:15:59,147 --> 00:16:01,315
but getting the identity
of the driver of the truck

255
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:03,117
and getting to him
before they do

256
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:05,386
is the only way I can give Lumen
what I promised.

257
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:12,793
All I get
is a fucking computer.

258
00:16:12,827 --> 00:16:14,461
I can order Jordan Chase books.

259
00:16:14,496 --> 00:16:16,030
I can order Jordan Chase CDs,

260
00:16:16,064 --> 00:16:19,199
but I can't talk
to an actual person.

261
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:21,535
Jordan Chase is a really
popular man, you know?

262
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,737
He travels the world
giving his little

263
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:25,039
touchy-feely seminars.

264
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:26,874
He's probably not even
in Miami right now.

265
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:28,475
I've left messages all over.

266
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,210
If I don't hear back soon,
I'm gonna kick their door in.

267
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:32,913
What about you?
Anything?

268
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:34,582
Yeah, we've I.D.'d two
of the girls

269
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:36,584
off their fingerprints.

270
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:38,686
One was a schoolteacher
from Wisconsin.

271
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,821
She came out here on vacation
two years ago.

272
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,222
Never heard from again.

273
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:45,159
The other one worked on a cruise
ship that was docked here.

274
00:16:45,193 --> 00:16:47,161
She disappeared
just over a year ago.

275
00:16:47,195 --> 00:16:48,629
Wow.

276
00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:51,065
Yeah, these were good girls,
you know?

277
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:53,467
One was 26, one was 29.

278
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:55,002
Nothing on the other three?

279
00:16:55,036 --> 00:16:57,838
No, I'm going through
the missing person databases.

280
00:16:57,872 --> 00:16:59,340
Put their
photographs out there.

281
00:16:59,374 --> 00:17:00,708
DNA?

282
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:02,242
It's being run now.

283
00:17:02,277 --> 00:17:04,511
Looking for direct hits
and familial hits.

284
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:06,046
Listen.

285
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:08,349
I heard about this two-bedroom
place on Brickell.

286
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:10,050
Upper unit, right on the water.

287
00:17:10,085 --> 00:17:11,552
Thought we could take a look.

288
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:12,920
This is not a workplace
conversation,

289
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:14,388
so please just shut up.

290
00:17:14,422 --> 00:17:16,757
All I'm saying is,
is this place is going fast.

291
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,459
Listen, please, just not here.

292
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:20,928
You two...

293
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:23,430
Now.

294
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,469
Shit.

295
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:30,437
Think she knows about us?

296
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:39,680
Is this about...

297
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:40,681
The Santa Muerte case.

298
00:17:40,715 --> 00:17:42,750
Oh.

299
00:17:42,784 --> 00:17:44,018
I thought that was dead.

300
00:17:44,052 --> 00:17:46,987
Well, now it's alive.
Barely.

301
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:50,691
Yasmin Aragon, the associate
of the Fuentes brothers

302
00:17:50,725 --> 00:17:52,926
that sergeant Batista
identified,

303
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:55,162
has assured us that
she will bring

304
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:57,364
Carlos and Marco into Club Mayan
tomorrow night.

305
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:59,199
- So we're on?
- We are on.

306
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:01,635
I am personally overseeing
this operation.

307
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,837
We can't risk word leaking out
to the Fuentes,

308
00:18:03,872 --> 00:18:06,073
so it's strictly
on a need-to-know basis.

309
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:09,076
Rather than flooding
the club with police personnel,

310
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,046
we will be performing
a small surgical operation.

311
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,781
We will take the brothers
into custody

312
00:18:13,815 --> 00:18:15,049
before they get into the club.

313
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,517
Detective Morgan,
you'll be with me

314
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:18,218
in the surveillance van.

315
00:18:18,253 --> 00:18:20,220
Detective Quinn,
we're gonna post you

316
00:18:20,255 --> 00:18:22,656
inside the door of the club
with officer Manzon.

317
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:23,924
I will be roving,
placing myself

318
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,626
wherever I believe
most effective.

319
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,461
If we're gonna
take them outside,

320
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:30,097
shouldn't we be outside?

321
00:18:30,131 --> 00:18:32,533
In order not to stand out
like sore thumbs,

322
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:35,169
we will continue with the posts
we've already established.

323
00:18:35,203 --> 00:18:37,171
Thank you,
detectives Morgan and Quinn.

324
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:40,474
That'll be all.

325
00:18:40,508 --> 00:18:42,843
Maria...

326
00:18:42,877 --> 00:18:46,280
Let me make myself very clear.

327
00:18:46,314 --> 00:18:48,782
You've wasted more than enough
time and money

328
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:50,951
on this case already.

329
00:18:50,985 --> 00:18:53,520
You're supposed to be a master
manipulator of the press,

330
00:18:53,555 --> 00:18:54,988
but you haven't even been able
to do that.

331
00:18:55,023 --> 00:18:57,091
Every day I pick up the paper,
read another story

332
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,126
about how we're not
doing our job.

333
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,328
Get it right this time

334
00:19:01,362 --> 00:19:03,330
or we're gonna have an
interesting conversation

335
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:07,768
about your future.

336
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:16,510
Where are we with Jordan Chase?

337
00:19:16,544 --> 00:19:19,246
I've got Quinn on it.

338
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,482
We've made numerous calls
to his organization,

339
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:24,418
but we haven't been able to
reach him personally just yet.

340
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:26,220
He could be
playing hard to get.

341
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:27,821
In that case,

342
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:29,556
we'll pay his office a visit
to see if, uh...

343
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:32,559
Probably won't be necessary.

344
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:38,365
Jordan Chase.

345
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:40,100
Uh, hi.

346
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:45,472
Holy shit.
That's him.

347
00:19:45,507 --> 00:19:48,509
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

348
00:19:48,543 --> 00:19:51,411
You too.

349
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:54,081
Mr. Chase?
Oh, Mr. Chase.

350
00:19:54,115 --> 00:19:55,482
- Stand back.
- I, um... I, uh...

351
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:57,084
I took one of your seminars
at the beach club

352
00:19:57,118 --> 00:19:58,552
a while back.

353
00:19:58,586 --> 00:20:00,087
Sure.
In Palmetto Bay?

354
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:01,522
You remember?

355
00:20:01,556 --> 00:20:03,157
Of course I do.

356
00:20:03,191 --> 00:20:04,591
You have to excuse Cole here.

357
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:06,493
He, uh... he keeps
the crazies away.

358
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:09,163
Why don't you let me get
a picture of you two?

359
00:20:09,197 --> 00:20:11,598
Oh, yeah.
Excellent. Okay.

360
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:14,234
- Okay.
- All right.

361
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:16,236
Smile.

362
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:17,437
Uh, one more.

363
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,440
Got it.

364
00:20:20,475 --> 00:20:22,409
Jordan Chase.

365
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:25,078
Dexter Morgan.

366
00:20:25,113 --> 00:20:26,079
Nice to meet you.

367
00:20:26,114 --> 00:20:27,414
Wow.
Nice watch.

368
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:29,516
Oh, uh, my dad gave it to me

369
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:30,851
when I was a teenager.

370
00:20:30,885 --> 00:20:33,787
It's water-resistant
to 100 meters.

371
00:20:33,822 --> 00:20:35,689
I have no idea why
I would ever need that,

372
00:20:35,723 --> 00:20:37,090
but it sure looks nice.

373
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,492
If that's the watch
that Lumen heard,

374
00:20:38,526 --> 00:20:39,827
I'll make sure it
accompanies you

375
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:42,963
to the bottom of the Atlantic.

376
00:20:42,997 --> 00:20:44,298
Mr. Chase.

377
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:47,568
You must be the person
in charge around here.

378
00:20:47,602 --> 00:20:49,303
I was in Jacksonville.

379
00:20:49,337 --> 00:20:50,904
Got an early call
from Cole here,

380
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:52,973
my head of security,
saying that one of our trucks

381
00:20:53,007 --> 00:20:54,374
had been stolen out of our lot

382
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:55,809
and that it just might
be the one

383
00:20:55,844 --> 00:20:58,212
we'd all been watching
on the news.

384
00:20:58,246 --> 00:20:59,546
I flew back as soon as I could.

385
00:20:59,581 --> 00:21:01,715
I see.

386
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:04,585
We found an article
of clothing in the vehicle.

387
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:07,187
My jacket.
It's my personal vehicle.

388
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:09,656
I always leave
my things inside.

389
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:11,458
- And the keys?
- The keys?

390
00:21:11,492 --> 00:21:13,727
Yeah, we found the keys
in the ignition.

391
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:16,763
There are a lot of ways
to steal a car.

392
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:19,066
Most thieves don't
have the actual key.

393
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:24,504
I leave a spare set of keys
on a hook inside our office.

394
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,006
All my guys know where
to find them

395
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,608
in case they need the truck.

396
00:21:27,642 --> 00:21:29,476
Honestly,
they're just sitting there.

397
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,378
Anyone could have grabbed them.

398
00:21:31,412 --> 00:21:33,013
And you're head of security?

399
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:35,015
Yeah, Cole.

400
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:38,518
I might have to tighten things
up a bit, hmm?

401
00:21:40,688 --> 00:21:43,190
I want to make it very clear
that the Miami Police Department

402
00:21:43,224 --> 00:21:44,825
has my full cooperation.

403
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:47,761
My organization is completely
open to you.

404
00:21:47,795 --> 00:21:50,664
This is a horrible,
horrible tragedy.

405
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:52,766
Please, anything I can do
to help facilitate

406
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,201
its resolution.

407
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:55,502
Well, thank you, Mr. Chase.

408
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:57,004
First, we're gonna need
fingerprints

409
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,240
and hair samples
from all your employees.

410
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:01,708
Starting with Cole.

411
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:03,043
Absolutely.

412
00:22:03,077 --> 00:22:04,912
And if I could ask one favor?

413
00:22:04,946 --> 00:22:06,847
I'd appreciate it if my name
and organization

414
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:09,983
wasn't released to the press.

415
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:13,420
Being connected to this in any
way would be a P.R. nightmare.

416
00:22:13,454 --> 00:22:15,389
I'm sure you understand.

417
00:22:15,423 --> 00:22:17,591
As long as we have your
continued cooperation,

418
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,160
that shouldn't be a problem.

419
00:22:20,194 --> 00:22:22,596
Sociopaths can't feel
psychic pain,

420
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,231
but they can feel
physical pain.

421
00:22:24,265 --> 00:22:25,699
Ow.

422
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:28,368
Sorry.

423
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,241
What do you think about Cole?

424
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:36,710
"It wasn't me.

425
00:22:36,744 --> 00:22:40,747
Someone stole my vehicle."

426
00:22:40,782 --> 00:22:43,383
The oldest excuse in the book.

427
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:44,685
Still, it does happen.

428
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:48,288
And Mr. Chase
is very high-profile,

429
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:51,158
well respected.

430
00:22:51,192 --> 00:22:52,693
It's hard to imagine
someone like him

431
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:56,029
or his people would be involved
in something like this.

432
00:23:02,103 --> 00:23:04,171
I took a few hairs
from the headrest

433
00:23:04,205 --> 00:23:06,406
of the truck as well.

434
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:07,741
If someone else was driving,

435
00:23:07,775 --> 00:23:09,209
he'd have left some
evidence behind.

436
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:10,777
And?

437
00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:12,779
Well, Cole's hair
matches the hair

438
00:23:12,814 --> 00:23:14,414
on the jacket and the headrest.

439
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:15,983
- Fingerprints?
- They're all Cole's.

440
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:17,951
Even on the ignition key.

441
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:18,986
I think he's just
become the focus

442
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,487
of our investigation.

443
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:22,456
And Jordan?

444
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,858
His alibi holds up.
He was in Jacksonville.

445
00:23:24,892 --> 00:23:29,763
So for now,
we got our eyes on Cole.

446
00:23:47,415 --> 00:23:48,582
Lumen?

447
00:23:48,616 --> 00:23:51,184
Dexter, you need
to announce yourself.

448
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:53,120
I don't know who's coming in.

449
00:23:53,154 --> 00:23:56,490
But it's okay to have packages
delivered here?

450
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:01,495
I need things.

451
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:04,498
You said not
to leave the house.

452
00:24:10,171 --> 00:24:13,640
And what are you gonna
do with that?

453
00:24:13,674 --> 00:24:17,878
It's just a flashlight.

454
00:24:17,912 --> 00:24:21,515
You have a way
of bending the rules.

455
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,188
What's going on with the case?

456
00:24:29,824 --> 00:24:33,026
Do you know this man?

457
00:24:33,061 --> 00:24:36,897
Oh, my God.

458
00:24:36,931 --> 00:24:39,633
That's him.

459
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,535
That's the guy
who folded his jacket.

460
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:43,203
How did you find him?

461
00:24:43,237 --> 00:24:44,704
He found us.

462
00:24:44,739 --> 00:24:46,206
His name's Cole Harmon.

463
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,711
He's Jordan Chase's
head of security.

464
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:55,715
What about him?

465
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,717
No, I...

466
00:24:57,752 --> 00:24:59,086
I mean, that guy's
clearly a freak,

467
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,254
but I don't know him.

468
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:03,457
No, not the bald guy.
The guy beside him.

469
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:04,524
Jordan Chase.

470
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,762
Oh.

471
00:25:08,796 --> 00:25:10,730
- No, I don't know him either.
- You sure?

472
00:25:10,765 --> 00:25:12,566
I told you, I didn't see
most of their faces.

473
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:16,903
Who is he?

474
00:25:16,938 --> 00:25:20,674
He's some sort
of motivational speaker.

475
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:25,412
This guy...
I definitely know.

476
00:25:25,446 --> 00:25:26,880
What next?

477
00:25:26,914 --> 00:25:29,182
Well, there's a problem.
The homicide team is on this.

478
00:25:29,217 --> 00:25:31,785
They'll probably arrest him
within the next few days

479
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:33,687
and once that happens,
Cole will never see

480
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:36,189
the outside
of a prison cell again.

481
00:25:36,224 --> 00:25:38,525
What about the other guys?

482
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,696
In order to save his own skin,
he'll probably turn them in.

483
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,764
It's only a matter of time
before they're all

484
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,734
in the hands of the police.

485
00:25:52,406 --> 00:25:54,574
But this is Florida.
We execute here.

486
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:58,912
These men will be brought
to justice.

487
00:25:58,946 --> 00:26:00,180
You can walk away
from all of this now,

488
00:26:00,214 --> 00:26:02,382
put it behind you.

489
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:04,985
You can go on with your life.

490
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:07,120
No.

491
00:26:07,155 --> 00:26:08,455
That's not what I want.

492
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:11,725
I promise you the police
will take care of it.

493
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:13,927
No, I don't want the police
to take care of it.

494
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:16,663
I... I want to take care of it.

495
00:26:16,697 --> 00:26:18,231
I know how she feels.

496
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:23,470
It's not so different from me.

497
00:26:23,504 --> 00:26:25,405
How much coffee
are you drinking?

498
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:27,073
A lot.

499
00:26:27,108 --> 00:26:28,441
I have to stay awake.

500
00:26:28,476 --> 00:26:29,476
What if they come
for me at night?

501
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,112
She's stressed, on edge.

502
00:26:32,146 --> 00:26:33,813
The way I feel
when I've gone too long

503
00:26:33,848 --> 00:26:35,849
without putting someone
on my table.

504
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:38,418
You said you'd help me.

505
00:26:38,452 --> 00:26:39,686
I did.

506
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,987
I just don't know
that helping you

507
00:26:41,022 --> 00:26:43,056
kill someone
is actually helping you.

508
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:47,093
This is all I think about.

509
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,300
Don't back out now.

510
00:26:53,334 --> 00:26:54,668
This is important to me.

511
00:26:57,205 --> 00:27:00,807
Truth is, I actually want
to help her...

512
00:27:03,444 --> 00:27:06,580
For some very complicated
reasons.

513
00:27:06,614 --> 00:27:10,250
If we want Cole for ourselves,

514
00:27:10,284 --> 00:27:13,253
I have to derail
the police investigation,

515
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,791
who?

516
00:27:17,825 --> 00:27:21,027
The man who actually killed
all those girls.

517
00:27:21,062 --> 00:27:23,496
Boyd Fowler.

518
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:49,389
Here.
Put these on.

519
00:27:49,423 --> 00:27:51,524
First thing we have to do
is remove any evidence

520
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,360
that you were ever here
at Boyd's house.

521
00:27:53,394 --> 00:27:57,998
If police find
your fingerprints or...

522
00:27:58,032 --> 00:28:00,200
Anything that ties you
to this place,

523
00:28:00,234 --> 00:28:02,035
they're gonna want to know
what your relationship

524
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:03,870
to Boyd Fowler is.

525
00:28:03,904 --> 00:28:06,640
How you got here.

526
00:28:06,674 --> 00:28:10,910
How you got out.

527
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:15,148
That's where you
first found me.

528
00:28:15,182 --> 00:28:20,186
We need to go up.

529
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:23,323
You okay?

530
00:28:23,357 --> 00:28:26,326
I'll be with you.

531
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:46,346
Oh, God.

532
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,683
You okay?
We can leave.

533
00:28:49,717 --> 00:28:54,354
No.

534
00:28:54,388 --> 00:28:57,657
He kept me tied up...
Over there.

535
00:29:00,895 --> 00:29:06,333
I don't know how long
I was here.

536
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:08,668
Maybe a couple days.

537
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:12,806
All I know is that he brought me
here to kill me.

538
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,010
I'm guessing that was his job.

539
00:29:17,044 --> 00:29:19,579
He was the finisher.

540
00:29:23,217 --> 00:29:27,687
The last day,
I chewed on that rope for hours.

541
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:29,222
I was finally able
to slip it off.

542
00:29:29,256 --> 00:29:32,325
That's when I went downstairs
and I saw you...

543
00:29:35,496 --> 00:29:40,066
...do what I did.

544
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:57,150
Is that it?

545
00:29:57,184 --> 00:29:58,385
Yeah.

546
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:00,120
I just need something
of Boyd's to plant

547
00:30:00,154 --> 00:30:03,056
in the truck from the accident.

548
00:30:06,293 --> 00:30:07,727
His wallet.

549
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:09,763
How did you know
that was there?

550
00:30:09,797 --> 00:30:12,031
I put it there.

551
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:15,235
Hold the fucking phone,
everyone!

552
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:17,103
I was giving Cole's truck
another quick once-over

553
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:20,006
and I found something that our
blind-as-fucking-bats

554
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,341
lab geeks missed.

555
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:24,010
- What have you got?
- A wallet.

556
00:30:24,044 --> 00:30:26,746
He probably had it sitting
on the console and then

557
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:28,348
it went flying when he got hit.

558
00:30:28,382 --> 00:30:30,517
- I found it under the seat.
- Cole's wallet?

559
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:32,452
No, that's just it.
It's not Cole's.

560
00:30:32,486 --> 00:30:34,354
Whose is it?

561
00:30:34,388 --> 00:30:37,791
Boyd Fowler's.

562
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:41,428
Who the fuck is Boyd Fowler?

563
00:30:42,897 --> 00:30:48,568
I'm going upstairs.

564
00:30:48,602 --> 00:30:50,637
Check it out.

565
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:53,239
There are locks of hair in here

566
00:30:53,274 --> 00:30:54,541
numbered 1 through 12.

567
00:30:54,575 --> 00:30:55,775
12?

568
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,544
Jesus.

569
00:30:57,578 --> 00:31:01,581
Well, I'll run DNA
on all the hair samples

570
00:31:01,615 --> 00:31:03,016
and match it to the victims.

571
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,284
The guy that did this...

572
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:06,119
Died exactly
where you're standing.

573
00:31:06,153 --> 00:31:08,254
Hey.

574
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:11,791
In here.

575
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:18,765
The same exact barrel
the girls were in.

576
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,402
Jesus.
What'd he do with these?

577
00:31:22,436 --> 00:31:23,970
The preliminary
medical examiner's report

578
00:31:24,004 --> 00:31:25,505
said all the girls
were electrocuted.

579
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:27,674
We're gonna need forensics
in the attic.

580
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:30,176
I think he kept
the girls up there.

581
00:31:30,211 --> 00:31:33,813
It looks like Boyd Fowler
has become our primary focus.

582
00:31:38,452 --> 00:31:41,321
Do you know this man?

583
00:31:41,355 --> 00:31:43,623
No.

584
00:31:43,657 --> 00:31:46,259
Well, he knows you.

585
00:31:46,293 --> 00:31:48,294
He has all your books
and CDs in his house.

586
00:31:50,831 --> 00:31:53,666
I've sold over a million
copies of my book.

587
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:54,968
Almost as many CDs.

588
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:57,036
I'm just trying to figure out

589
00:31:57,071 --> 00:31:58,838
how he came to be driving
your truck.

590
00:32:01,075 --> 00:32:02,876
Well, I'm sorry, but...

591
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,678
I know him.
Boyd Fowler.

592
00:32:05,713 --> 00:32:09,415
He was one of your stalkers.

593
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,418
And how come I'm
just now hearing this?

594
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:14,854
No reason to tell you about
every nut that passes through.

595
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:17,690
He never seemed
like a serious threat.

596
00:32:17,725 --> 00:32:19,292
He took a few seminars
a while back

597
00:32:19,326 --> 00:32:21,227
and then started showing up
at our office

598
00:32:21,262 --> 00:32:23,029
asking for Mr. Chase.

599
00:32:23,063 --> 00:32:25,164
I had to escort him off
the premises a few times.

600
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:26,232
He was clearly a bit off,

601
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:28,201
but he never struck
me as dangerous.

602
00:32:28,235 --> 00:32:31,938
He's dangerous.

603
00:32:31,972 --> 00:32:36,843
He'd been in and out
of our offices enough times.

604
00:32:36,877 --> 00:32:38,945
Probably saw where
I put the keys.

605
00:32:38,979 --> 00:32:41,180
When's the last time you
had contact with him?

606
00:32:41,215 --> 00:32:44,751
Haven't seen him for a while.

607
00:32:44,785 --> 00:32:46,185
Couple of months maybe.

608
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,054
Any idea where he might be?

609
00:32:48,088 --> 00:32:51,524
No.

610
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:55,194
We have a warrant
for his arrest.

611
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:58,698
I suggest that you be especially
cautious, Mr. Chase,

612
00:32:58,732 --> 00:33:00,366
because if he has
a thing for you,

613
00:33:00,401 --> 00:33:01,834
you could be in danger.

614
00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:03,970
Noted.

615
00:33:04,004 --> 00:33:05,471
Now, if you have
any contact with him,

616
00:33:05,506 --> 00:33:07,707
please get in touch
with us immediately.

617
00:33:07,741 --> 00:33:10,376
This guy is very bad news.

618
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:12,712
I will.

619
00:33:12,746 --> 00:33:13,947
Thank you for coming in.

620
00:33:13,981 --> 00:33:16,983
I appreciate it.

621
00:33:39,506 --> 00:33:42,208
You finally
did something right.

622
00:33:42,242 --> 00:33:44,077
Steering the cops toward Boyd.

623
00:33:44,111 --> 00:33:46,813
Very smart.

624
00:33:46,847 --> 00:33:48,781
It wasn't me.

625
00:33:53,954 --> 00:33:59,726
Daddy's going
to Boca Raton tonight.

626
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,429
'Cause that's
where Cole Harmon lives.

627
00:34:03,464 --> 00:34:07,233
He's a bad man.

628
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:09,435
And I'm gonna try to find out

629
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:12,305
who the rest of his bad man
friends are.

630
00:34:12,339 --> 00:34:14,107
You want that?

631
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,410
Hi.

632
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:20,279
There's my angel.

633
00:34:20,314 --> 00:34:25,084
Let me just set my things down.

634
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,919
Wonder how much longer
I'm gonna be able

635
00:34:26,954 --> 00:34:28,221
to talk to you like this.

636
00:34:28,255 --> 00:34:32,325
Soon you're gonna start
to understand me.

637
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:35,094
Harrison clearly loves
his Saint Brigid.

638
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:37,030
He put it with his
favorite toys.

639
00:34:37,064 --> 00:34:39,032
I put that in the toy box.

640
00:34:39,066 --> 00:34:40,500
Sorry?

641
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:41,834
It's just a statue of a lady

642
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:43,036
who died a long time ago.

643
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,937
She doesn't protect anybody
or anything.

644
00:34:44,972 --> 00:34:47,106
I should get to work.

645
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:48,641
Here.
Go to Sonya.

646
00:34:48,676 --> 00:34:53,379
Oh.

647
00:34:53,414 --> 00:34:57,050
It's just this can be
a very dark world at times,

648
00:34:57,084 --> 00:34:58,918
and since dear Brigid has always
been a comfort to me,

649
00:34:58,952 --> 00:35:00,653
I thought Harrison might
feel the same.

650
00:35:00,688 --> 00:35:03,456
I hope for his sake,
you'd reconsider.

651
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:07,160
Sure.

652
00:35:07,194 --> 00:35:09,262
Bye, buddy.

653
00:35:10,998 --> 00:35:14,767
So, uh...
What are you wearing tonight?

654
00:35:14,802 --> 00:35:16,369
To the big stakeout?

655
00:35:16,403 --> 00:35:19,272
Um, a diaper probably.

656
00:35:20,874 --> 00:35:22,108
I'll have to sit in that van

657
00:35:22,142 --> 00:35:24,310
with Batista for hours.

658
00:35:24,344 --> 00:35:26,946
Will you please not wear
that awful shirt

659
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,514
with the patterns all over it?

660
00:35:28,549 --> 00:35:30,249
It really makes me dizzy.

661
00:35:30,284 --> 00:35:33,319
No, I, uh, only wore
that as a joke.

662
00:35:33,353 --> 00:35:34,754
Oh.

663
00:35:34,788 --> 00:35:36,923
Hey, I got to go.
I'll see you later tonight.

664
00:35:36,957 --> 00:35:39,959
Okay.

665
00:35:46,266 --> 00:35:47,667
Hey.

666
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:49,435
Well, look at you.

667
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,703
Pretty as a picture.

668
00:35:52,206 --> 00:35:53,372
I only got a few minutes,
so, uh,

669
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:54,607
what do you got for me?

670
00:35:54,641 --> 00:35:55,808
I don't work for free, Quinn.

671
00:35:55,843 --> 00:35:58,644
All right, well,
I just gave you 500 bucks.

672
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:00,813
And I told you about the girl.

673
00:36:00,848 --> 00:36:02,648
But if you want
to find out who she is,

674
00:36:02,683 --> 00:36:05,218
where she's from, and what she's
doing in that damn house,

675
00:36:05,252 --> 00:36:07,453
I might have to employ
some methods

676
00:36:07,488 --> 00:36:11,157
just a little bit unorthodox.

677
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:13,493
And for that,
you're gonna have to pay.

678
00:36:13,527 --> 00:36:15,394
I don't know.

679
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:17,563
I know you got the cash.

680
00:36:17,598 --> 00:36:19,499
Yeah, it's not that.

681
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:24,737
It's the pussy.

682
00:36:24,772 --> 00:36:25,938
Now lookie here, stud,

683
00:36:25,973 --> 00:36:27,340
if you're backing off
this thing

684
00:36:27,374 --> 00:36:29,108
'cause you're porking
that guy's sister,

685
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:31,310
I'd say you've got
your priorities as a cop

686
00:36:31,345 --> 00:36:35,181
all wrong.

687
00:36:35,215 --> 00:36:37,383
I'm a little embarrassed
for you.

688
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:39,452
I'll give you another five.

689
00:36:42,222 --> 00:36:47,160
That'll work.

690
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,134
You don't have to do anything
with this, okay?

691
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:56,803
You can just talk normally.

692
00:36:56,837 --> 00:36:58,304
What do I have to do?

693
00:36:58,338 --> 00:36:59,772
We're gonna walk you
through the club

694
00:36:59,807 --> 00:37:01,274
so that our team can get
a visual on you,

695
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:04,210
and then you're just gonna
wait by the door.

696
00:37:04,244 --> 00:37:06,312
The second you see
the Fuentes brothers,

697
00:37:06,346 --> 00:37:08,681
you walk up to them and you
engage in conversation

698
00:37:08,715 --> 00:37:11,184
outside of the club until we
move in and take 'em.

699
00:37:11,218 --> 00:37:12,385
What am I supposed to say?

700
00:37:12,419 --> 00:37:15,354
Tell 'em how hot they look.

701
00:37:15,389 --> 00:37:16,389
You really don't have
to worry about anything.

702
00:37:16,423 --> 00:37:18,024
We're gonna be right there.

703
00:37:18,058 --> 00:37:20,459
I want to make sure
we're all in contact.

704
00:37:20,494 --> 00:37:22,862
This is sergeant Batista.
Is everybody getting this?

705
00:37:22,896 --> 00:37:25,264
- Loud and clear.
- I can hear you.

706
00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:26,666
Looks like we're all in place.

707
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,270
? ?

708
00:37:37,678 --> 00:37:40,546
Okay.

709
00:37:43,517 --> 00:37:45,451
You'll do great.

710
00:38:06,573 --> 00:38:08,107
They're already here.

711
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:10,576
Say again?

712
00:38:10,611 --> 00:38:12,345
I said they're already here.

713
00:38:12,379 --> 00:38:14,680
Sitting at the VIP table.

714
00:38:14,715 --> 00:38:15,948
Okay, how'd that happen?

715
00:38:15,983 --> 00:38:17,450
I thought we had
all the doors covered.

716
00:38:17,484 --> 00:38:19,185
I don't know.

717
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:21,554
I heard there's a secret door
from the club next door,

718
00:38:21,588 --> 00:38:24,056
but I've never seen it.

719
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:28,694
Okay, this is
a change of plans.

720
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:30,596
Yasmin, go sit with them.

721
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:33,466
We're gonna sit tight
until they leave.

722
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,269
Once they step outside the club,
we take them.

723
00:38:36,303 --> 00:38:37,970
Let's make sure we find
that secret door

724
00:38:38,005 --> 00:38:39,205
and deploy a team there
as well.

725
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:40,273
Everyone got that?

726
00:38:40,307 --> 00:38:43,276
- Got it.
- Got it.

727
00:38:49,049 --> 00:38:52,618
We've been here
for over an hour.

728
00:38:52,653 --> 00:38:54,720
I know.

729
00:38:54,755 --> 00:38:57,256
Well, you said there's
a seminar in Naples.

730
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:59,258
Don't you think he's there?

731
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,294
Probably.

732
00:39:01,328 --> 00:39:03,162
So what are you waiting for?

733
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:09,936
That.

734
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,004
The neighbor to go to bed.

735
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,906
I'm going in.

736
00:39:13,941 --> 00:39:16,042
No, you're staying here.

737
00:39:16,076 --> 00:39:17,977
What?
No.

738
00:39:18,011 --> 00:39:19,845
Yes.
It's too dangerous.

739
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,747
I have no idea what's inside.

740
00:39:21,782 --> 00:39:25,318
I'm gonna have my hands full
without watching over you.

741
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,254
Fine.

742
00:39:28,288 --> 00:39:34,093
Well, you can...
Be the lookout.

743
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:37,330
It's so great working with you.

744
00:39:37,364 --> 00:39:40,633
If you see anything, call me.

745
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:51,711
? ?

746
00:39:51,745 --> 00:39:53,446
We are starting
to look a little obvious.

747
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,147
I am gonna go get us
a club soda.

748
00:39:55,182 --> 00:39:58,150
All right, yeah.

749
00:40:21,608 --> 00:40:22,575
He's calling me over.

750
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:24,643
No, keep moving.
Ignore him.

751
00:40:24,678 --> 00:40:26,045
This is lieutenant Laguerta.

752
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,381
Officer Manzon, go to him,
make nice,

753
00:40:28,415 --> 00:40:30,316
and try to get him
to step outside the club.

754
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,817
Lieutenant, no.
This is a problem.

755
00:40:31,852 --> 00:40:33,019
These guys are dangerous.

756
00:40:33,053 --> 00:40:34,420
Stand down, Morgan.

757
00:40:34,454 --> 00:40:36,188
She's in charge.

758
00:40:36,223 --> 00:40:37,990
Nothing we can do.

759
00:40:50,804 --> 00:40:52,938
No.

760
00:41:01,581 --> 00:41:03,282
Police!
Drop that fucking gun!

761
00:41:04,985 --> 00:41:06,685
Holy fucking shit!

762
00:41:08,622 --> 00:41:10,423
Move! Move! Move!

763
00:41:14,294 --> 00:41:15,861
Stop right there.
Down on the ground.

764
00:41:15,896 --> 00:41:17,263
Police!
Drop the gun!

765
00:41:17,297 --> 00:41:18,898
- Back away!
- Drop the gun now!

766
00:41:18,932 --> 00:41:21,901
Oh, you again.

767
00:41:21,935 --> 00:41:23,536
You should walk away
before this one

768
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,804
gets more than
just a little cut.

769
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:26,238
Drop the gun right now.

770
00:41:26,273 --> 00:41:27,640
Please!

771
00:41:40,687 --> 00:41:42,388
You okay?

772
00:41:42,422 --> 00:41:44,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

773
00:41:44,724 --> 00:41:48,928
It's okay.
Come here.

774
00:42:21,728 --> 00:42:23,028
Cole as a teenager.

775
00:42:30,604 --> 00:42:31,704
Who the fuck are you?

776
00:42:32,906 --> 00:42:35,975
No fucking way!

777
00:42:36,009 --> 00:42:37,042
Who are you, motherfucker?

778
00:42:46,186 --> 00:42:48,621
We have to go
before he sees our faces.

779
00:42:48,655 --> 00:42:50,656
Holy shit!

780
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,525
I can't believe
that just happened!

781
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:53,792
What made you come inside?

782
00:42:53,827 --> 00:42:55,628
I thought I saw a shadow.

783
00:42:55,662 --> 00:42:57,396
And that made you come
crashing through a window?

784
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,564
I know.
I know.

785
00:42:58,598 --> 00:42:59,865
I just had a feeling.

786
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,634
It was some sort
of lizard brain thing.

787
00:43:01,668 --> 00:43:05,704
She's starting
to sound like me.

788
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:06,705
That's Cole.

789
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,374
And Boyd.

790
00:43:08,408 --> 00:43:09,375
And Dan the dentist.

791
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:10,843
It's them from, like,

792
00:43:10,877 --> 00:43:12,244
15 years ago.

793
00:43:12,279 --> 00:43:13,812
Do you recognize any
of the others?

794
00:43:13,847 --> 00:43:17,416
No, just those three.

795
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:19,952
What does this mean?

796
00:43:19,986 --> 00:43:21,987
I don't know.

797
00:43:22,022 --> 00:43:24,590
They've known each other since
they were kids.

798
00:43:24,624 --> 00:43:26,692
Oh, my God, Dexter.
This is huge.

799
00:43:26,726 --> 00:43:29,762
We just have to figure out
who they are.

800
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:41,240
So what do we do next?

801
00:43:44,444 --> 00:43:46,779
What?

802
00:43:46,813 --> 00:43:50,749
You said "we."

803
00:43:54,054 --> 00:43:56,188
Put on your seatbelt.

804
00:44:07,834 --> 00:44:09,535
This is a fucking disaster.

805
00:44:09,569 --> 00:44:11,270
Carlos Fuentes
was shot and killed.

806
00:44:11,304 --> 00:44:14,240
Our informant, Yasmin Aragon,
was shot and killed,

807
00:44:14,274 --> 00:44:16,308
as well as another
innocent bystander.

808
00:44:16,343 --> 00:44:17,810
Son of a bitch.

809
00:44:17,844 --> 00:44:19,178
At this point, we don't know
if it's by our gunfire

810
00:44:19,212 --> 00:44:20,613
or that of the two brothers.

811
00:44:20,647 --> 00:44:24,083
Additionally, three other
bystanders were wounded.

812
00:44:24,117 --> 00:44:27,987
I want a full report
by 8:00 A.M.

813
00:44:32,425 --> 00:44:35,961
I know it looks bad.
And it is bad...

814
00:44:35,996 --> 00:44:37,429
But we are going
to get through this.

815
00:44:37,464 --> 00:44:40,733
I promise you.

816
00:44:40,767 --> 00:44:43,769
In the heat of battle...

817
00:44:43,803 --> 00:44:45,671
All cops make occasional
mistakes in judgment.

818
00:44:45,705 --> 00:44:48,240
Excuse me?

819
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:51,944
If mistakes were made, they
most certainly were not mine.

820
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:18,337
Hey.

821
00:45:18,371 --> 00:45:20,205
He was so relaxed and happy,

822
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,574
I couldn't bear to move.

823
00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:26,111
And I have to admit,
he feels quite good.

824
00:45:26,146 --> 00:45:28,814
He's always so happy
in her arms.

825
00:45:39,426 --> 00:45:42,361
Partners come
to us in various ways.

826
00:45:42,395 --> 00:45:45,064
Bound together for many
different reasons.

827
00:45:45,098 --> 00:45:46,899
But for any partnership
to work,

828
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:49,768
you must not only accept this
person into your life,

829
00:45:49,803 --> 00:45:54,340
but accept her for who she is.

830
00:46:14,394 --> 00:46:17,863
Saint Brigid...

831
00:46:17,897 --> 00:46:20,833
Circle us with your light...

832
00:46:20,867 --> 00:46:24,036
So that no darkness shall
overcome our world.

833
00:46:28,308 --> 00:46:30,476
Hey.

834
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:33,545
Hi.

835
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,546
Hi.

836
00:46:34,581 --> 00:46:37,516
Hi.

837
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:39,318
Harrison, this is Lumen.

838
00:46:39,352 --> 00:46:40,319
Hi.

839
00:46:40,353 --> 00:46:43,288
Oh, my goodness.
Hello.

840
00:46:51,865 --> 00:46:54,900
Sometimes partners find us,
and as much as we try

841
00:46:54,934 --> 00:46:56,502
to push them away,
they work their way

842
00:46:56,536 --> 00:47:00,038
into our lives regardless,
until we finally realize

843
00:47:00,073 --> 00:47:02,341
how much we need them.
