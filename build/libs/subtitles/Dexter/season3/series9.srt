1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,628
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:05,963
I found a fucking lead
on the Skinner case.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,966
The Skinner is using tree-trimming
as a cover for surveillance.

4
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:12,345
He watches from the trees,
and when the time is right, he grabs them.

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:16,182
Mr. King. We met at the scene of
our second victim, is that correct?

6
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,392
Yes, that is correct.

7
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,310
Mario Astorga?

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,395
I don't know anything.

9
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,439
Then why would George King
suggest otherwise?

10
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,024
What are you so afraid of, Mario?

11
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,944
This is the shirt I was wearing
when Freebo met his end.

12
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,737
That's his blood right there.

13
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,949
This shirt implicates me
in his death.

14
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,618
I trust you, and I want you to trust me.

15
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:39,205
But he's being secretive.
He's never home. He says he's with Dexter.

16
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,374
But I think it's a cover.

17
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,043
Freebo's final resting place.

18
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,213
Hiding a body in a cemetery.
You're fucking brilliant.

19
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,799
We need to go
after the root cause,

20
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:53,261
his bloodsucking, soulless
defense attorney, Ellen Wolf!

21
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,139
- We can't kill her.
- I see.

22
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,933
- This is personal.
- Fuck, yes, this is personal.

23
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,644
I'm asking you to do this
for me as my friend.

24
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,272
- I'm sorry. No.
- Well, then, fuck you!

25
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,775
Someone loaned Freebo some money
and is willing to skin people to get it back.

26
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,653
We're gonna spread the word
that Anton knows where Freebo is.

27
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,406
Which means that the Skinner
will be looking for me.

28
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:14,699
What are you hiding?

29
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,201
Anton is not officially a CI.

30
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,287
We used him as bait.

31
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,497
What, are you in love with the guy?

32
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,001
Anton, you in there?

33
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,795
Shit. Trimmed trees.
The Skinner's been here.

34
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,881
I'm ready to get my hands dirty.

35
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,591
I've always done the deed alone.

36
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,426
Never stood outside,

37
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,720
been a witness to this moment.

38
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,892
You've set something
in motion here.

39
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,145
Everything Miguel does from now on
is connected to you.

40
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,973
Today I wake up,

41
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,183
kiss the wife-to-be...

42
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,691
...feed the stepkids-to-be...

43
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,281
...dress myself
in the usual pants, shirt...

44
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,369
...and pretence.

45
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,624
But last night, it was no pretence.

46
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,584
Miguel and I took a life.

47
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,631
Together. And today,
someone knows my truth,

48
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,091
shares my reality.

49
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,677
I'm not alone.

50
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,476
Sylvia, good morning.

51
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,478
Sorry for coming over so early.

52
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,563
- It's OK.
- But...

53
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,983
I need to see your face
when I ask you.

54
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,318
Ask me?

55
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,570
Syl, what is it?

56
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,365
Miguel was out till all hours
last night.

57
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,117
He says he was with you.
Is that true?

58
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,913
Absolutely. We were...

59
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,414
just hanging.

60
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,668
- Being guys. You know.
- Miguel was telling the truth.

61
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,588
You see, there's nothing to worry about.
Dexter didn't get here till late.

62
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,424
- It was...
- It had to be almost midnight.

63
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,635
Miguel got home an hour ago.

64
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,471
Oh.

65
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,141
He's having an affair.

66
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,395
Oh, no. No, no.
You don't know that.

67
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,397
When you've been married
as long as we have,

68
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,107
you know when your husband's lying.

69
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,526
Something to look forward to.

70
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,570
Maybe Dexter knows
where he went.

71
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,073
I really don't.

72
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:30,121
But he did talk about a case
he needed to look over.

73
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,039
At the office.

74
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,750
This really isn't your problem.
I should go.

75
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,460
No. No, no, no.

76
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,338
You stay here for as long
as you need to, OK?

77
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,343
I'll just... leave.

78
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,851
Work.

79
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,190
With a detour on the way.

80
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,124
Dex.

81
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,043
Dex, man.

82
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,548
How you doing? You OK?

83
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,592
- I'm good.
- Me too.

84
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,136
It's like there was
an imbalance in the world,

85
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,598
and we righted it,
with our own hands.

86
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,768
- It was deserving.
- I don't know. I feel real.

87
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,978
Like, maybe for the first time in my life.

88
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,064
I know what you mean.

89
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,360
But if we're thinking
about continuing

90
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,238
- these extracurricular activities...
- Absolutely.

91
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,782
...you need to work on your alibis.

92
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,451
Syl stopped by this morning,
wondering where you'd been.

93
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,036
Ah, shit.

94
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,913
Co?o. I'm a moron.

95
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,707
I tried to cover for you,
but I thought you went home.

96
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,542
I'm sorry, man.

97
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,712
I went over to Jack's Hideaway
over on 57th. I was, like, so wired.

98
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,382
The next thing I know,
the sun was coming up.

99
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,010
Jack's Hideaway.

100
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,513
Don't worry about Syl.
I can handle that.

101
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,934
I got a motion hearing this morning, though,
I don't wanna miss.

102
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,609
I'll get better at this. With your help.

103
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:27,029
I stalked a wife-killer
at Jack's Hideaway last year,

104
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,989
grabbed him right at closing...

105
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,324
at 2am.

106
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,786
Sylvia said Miguel got home
an hour ago.

107
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,998
Did he just lie? To me?

108
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,129
Another detour.

109
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,265
- There's nothing here either.
- Well, what about the blinds?

110
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,601
- What about the glass?
- Checked them. Deb, there's no blood.

111
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,271
Anton didn't just follow
the Skinner out of here.

112
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,106
I'll keep looking.

113
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,609
- I think we need to recanvass.
- We've talked to everyone in the building.

114
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,528
What about the kids?
They're awake now.

115
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,905
- We'll talk to the kids.
- What do we got?

116
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,991
The Skinner has Anton.
Did you see the trees?

117
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,660
I saw them.
It doesn't mean he got nabbed.

118
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,706
The coffee pot was left burning.
I mean, he definitely left in a hurry.

119
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,292
What the hell was Anton doing
back in town?

120
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,628
He never left. He contacted me,
but he wouldn't agree to surveillance.

121
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,590
Who cares if he agrees? He's a CI.

122
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,217
That's why we used him as bait
in the first place.

123
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,344
Guys.

124
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,848
- No liner.
- The building trash dumpster.

125
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,645
Subscription renewal form
from Rolling Stone

126
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:45,065
- addressed to Anton Briggs.
- This is his garbage.

127
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,235
So the bag split on impact
with the dumpster here.

128
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,154
He threw it. Defensive move.

129
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,698
Why the hell didn't he use his fists?

130
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:56,285
He was hurt.
There's blood and some hair.

131
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,914
- Looks like he hit his head against the wall.
- How bad?

132
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,918
Hard enough to daze him. A blow from
behind could have propelled him forward.

133
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,921
So Anton comes down to empty
the garbage,

134
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,089
the Skinner clocks him,

135
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,758
he does a header into the wall,

136
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,885
throws the bag as a last ditch.

137
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:16,889
Skinner tosses him in the car
and peels out. Got tire marks here.

138
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,516
Fuck.

139
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:23,103
All right, we got a confirmed
missing person. Anton Briggs.

140
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,398
Find a photo. Get his face out
to all patrols and the media.

141
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,110
Set up a tip line. Pull in some off-duties
to man the phone bank.

142
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:34,198
Skinner's had him for 24 hours.
How long do you think he can hold out?

143
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:38,285
Well, the ME's report on the other victims
suggests the Skinner starts slow.

144
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,122
Probably to build fear.
Anton's a big guy. A lot of skin.

145
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,626
That's meant to be comforting.

146
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,295
George King, we need to bring him in.

147
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,298
We gotta find him first.
We got BOLOs out on him all night long.

148
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,093
Haven't found him yet.
We could search his house, though.

149
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,512
We're still holding King's foreman
on resisting arrest?

150
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,555
He give us anything
that'll buy us a warrant?

151
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:02,101
Mario Astorga clammed up.
Too scared of King.

152
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:06,605
He would rather be deported
away from his family than talk about King.

153
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,608
- Is that all we got?
- Yeah.

154
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,528
I'll try and find a flexible judge.

155
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,114
Let me know when it comes in.
I'll go sit on King's house.

156
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,533
We'll go sit on King's house.

157
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,619
Hey, I want this above board.

158
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,080
Use restraint. Wait on a warrant.

159
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,918
And I hope they find something
because even if we nab King,

160
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,421
we got nothing to hold him on past today.

161
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,840
A day can save a lot of skin.

162
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,810
I keep... I keep telling you.
You have to listen.

163
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,645
If...

164
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,565
If I knew where Freebo was,

165
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,358
I'd tell you.

166
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,530
Don't you fucking understand, man?

167
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,326
It was the cops. I was... I was fucking bait.

168
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,706
All right, all right, you're right.

169
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,834
I know where he is.
I can show you. I can show you.

170
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,756
All right, listen to me.
He owes you money, right?

171
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,301
He owes you money?
I can get you money. I can find you money.

172
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,348
I don't want your money.

173
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,435
I loaned Freebo that money.

174
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,816
This is about respect.

175
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:47,873
With your first cut, you had all night
to consider my questions.

176
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:55,255
This cut, you have only one hour.

177
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,925
And when I return, there'll be no rest.

178
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,345
Use the time to think about...

179
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,640
the skin you have left

180
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,392
to lose.

181
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,115
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

182
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,950
Are you screening your calls?

183
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,537
Ellen? I'm surprised you missed
the motion hearing this morning.

184
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,539
So was Chicky Hines.

185
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,749
Of course, Miguel was perfectly
happy to get a continuance.

186
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,461
Uh, listen, if you're sick,
I can bring you over a sopa de pollo.

187
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,755
Either way, let me know you're all right.

188
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,924
OK? Bye.

189
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:43,762
Miguel went missing last night.

190
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,473
Ellen's missing this morning.

191
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,268
Could be a coincidence.

192
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:01,280
Patrol's been set up here all night.
King's not inside.

193
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,657
Well, something in there's
gonna tell us where he is.

194
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,868
Warrant should be here soon.

195
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,127
Motherfuck.

196
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,339
Anton? Anton, you in there?

197
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,676
- Anton, are you in there?
- Hey, I don't hear anything.

198
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,973
Yeah, well, I do. I hear somebody calling
for help. That's probable cause, right?

199
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,559
We're doing this above board.
The warrant's on its way.

200
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,728
Right. Restraint.

201
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,439
What the fuck are you doing?

202
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,524
Anton?

203
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,984
Shit.

204
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,570
Hey, you're not the only one
working this case, Morgan.

205
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,370
- Prado here.
- Hey.

206
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,207
Just checking in.
How'd the motion hearing go?

207
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,791
Continued.

208
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,712
- That's too bad.
- Oh, no, serendipitous actually.

209
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,547
It worked in my favor.

210
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,134
Listen, you don't have
to keep on checking on me.

211
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,888
Yeah, I know, I'm just a...

212
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,890
- concerned friend.
- Well, don't be.

213
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,559
In fact, why don't you meet me
at Cojimar for lunch?

214
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,354
Cause I been coming up
with some more, uh...

215
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,688
projects.

216
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,649
Another kill so soon?

217
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:22,194
I can't. I gotta keep an eye
on the situation here.

218
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,447
I heard. The Skinner grabbed up
another victim, huh?

219
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,115
Let me know if I can help.

220
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,826
Adi?s.

221
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,248
Adi?s.

222
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,000
Miami Metro hotline.

223
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,878
What location?
Who am I speaking with?

224
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,255
Can you spell that, please?

225
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,383
Anton Briggs' photo
hit the media an hour ago.

226
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,095
I'm gonna bring King's employee
up from holding, take another run at him.

227
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,806
Mario Astorga,
already in interview two.

228
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,559
- Thought I'd take a stab.
- I can handle it.

229
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,603
I know. But I wanna help.

230
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,898
Tired of standing
behind my glass wall.

231
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,109
Well, we can use the help today.

232
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,319
No, I knew,
I knew half those hookers

233
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,738
were pre-op trannies, but is it true...

234
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,199
their junk still works,
but nothing comes out?

235
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,285
It's called slug-fucking.

236
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,619
Hey. Hello.

237
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,123
Babe. Hey, Vice got word
you needed extra bodies.

238
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,500
- Thought I'd help out.
- That's cause you're the best.

239
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,751
- Aw.
- Mwah.

240
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,754
Hey, hey, get a room.
Actually, no, don't.

241
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,925
Miami Metro tip line.

242
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,760
Vince, you got a second?

243
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,061
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What?

244
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,147
Helping out on my day off.
You're welcome.

245
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,524
Good place to meet chicks
from other departments.

246
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,320
Yeah, well, that's my chick.
I don't want you talking your filth at her.

247
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,447
Whoa, whoa, hold up, gaucho.

248
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,782
I didn't bring that up. She did.

249
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,327
- Bullshit.
- Seriously.

250
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,954
She's like the Wikipedia of perv.

251
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,082
I gotta find me
a girlfriend from Vice.

252
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,877
She's awesome.

253
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,387
Fuck. Fucking nothing.
King could be anywhere.

254
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,140
Or right here.

255
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,393
Holy shit.

256
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,063
Remember,
we need his cooperation.

257
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,731
Restraint, right.

258
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,983
What are you doing at my house?

259
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,194
Mr. King, we have a warrant
to search the premises.

260
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,487
What are you looking for?

261
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,114
More like who. You wanna tell us
where you've been all night?

262
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,742
Oh, I work, ma'am. Nights. Mornings.

263
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,286
Trees keep growing.
It's a good business.

264
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,913
I'm only home to have breakfast.

265
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,499
You wanna grab a bagel
down at the station?

266
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,335
- Answer some questions?
- I'm happy to answer right here, sir.

267
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,338
What, you got somewhere
you need to be?

268
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,381
Trees.

269
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,924
They'll wait.

270
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,344
Am I under arrest, sir?

271
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,596
No, but we can hold you
for questioning.

272
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,599
- For the day.
- What are you, a lawyer?

273
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,102
No, wait, I forgot.
You're a fucking tree-trimmer.

274
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,608
I moved to this country
for its amazing liberties. I know my rights.

275
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,485
Great.

276
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:17,744
George King is hanging you out to dry,
Mario. I thought you might want a chance...

277
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,331
I've seen fear.
An-inch-away-from-death fear.

278
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:25,961
It'd be a shame to leave
your wife and your little baby behind.

279
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,171
His is real.

280
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,341
What makes you so scary,
George King?

281
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,677
You miss your country, George?

282
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,262
I like this country, sir.

283
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:39,433
- I like Miami, sir.
- Nicaragua can be a rough place, huh?

284
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,393
You in the military down there?

285
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,397
Death squads, Contras.

286
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,483
You woulda been about the right age
to get caught up in that.

287
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,861
You learn a few things there, George?

288
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,904
I learn respect, sir.

289
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,157
No interrogation techniques?

290
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,661
Maybe a little snatch and grab?
What do they call that? Renditioning?

291
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,788
Oh, I don't know that, ma'am.

292
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,415
Ma'am, sir.

293
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,543
You did learn respect.

294
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,799
Did you show any fucking respect
to Wendell when you tore his skin off?

295
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,218
How about Anton when you bashed him
over the goddamn head?

296
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,180
Morgan, you want a coffee?

297
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,432
Why don't you get a coffee?

298
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,143
Yeah.

299
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,645
Sure.

300
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,156
He looks harmless, doesn't he?

301
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,493
They usually do.

302
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,496
I don't know.
Maybe he's not our guy.

303
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,081
Well, you should trust
your instincts on this one.

304
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:49,461
- This one of your creepy insights?
- Why does it always have to be creepy?

305
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,379
Fucking tell me.

306
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:56,802
He's held life and death in his hands.
He likes it.

307
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,054
I knew it.

308
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,349
So how do I crack
this sick fuck's brain?

309
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,686
From what I've read
about these sick fucks,

310
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,190
they usually have some sort of... code.

311
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:15,320
I'd say disrespect is high
on his list of violations.

312
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,490
Maybe if you came at him
with deference.

313
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,827
Deference, huh?

314
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,247
Yeah, think about it.

315
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,166
Hey, Lieutenant.
I heard you say your friend Ellen is ill.

316
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,378
Was it a stomach thing?
Because I just read this article...

317
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,922
I don't know what it is.
I haven't heard back from her.

318
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:37,259
I left her three messages.
I'm a little worried.

319
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,094
Yeah, me too.

320
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,930
I hope she didn't get
in an accident or something.

321
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:45,016
Excuse me.
I have an errand to run.

322
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,944
A home office.

323
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,196
If she were sick,
this is where she'd be.

324
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:15,005
Her car's here. She could have gone
for a really long walk.

325
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,756
Or borrowed a friend's car.

326
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,384
Or maybe LaGuerta's right
and Ellen is comatose

327
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,178
in some hospital, post-accident.

328
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,680
One can hope.

329
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,142
Not that there are any signs
of foul play here.

330
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,063
But Harry did raise me
to be paranoid.

331
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,658
Blood. Damn it.

332
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,077
No. Miguel wouldn't do this.

333
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,163
We agreed Ellen Wolf is innocent.

334
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,497
Hello.

335
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:01,134
It's just blood. There's no body.
He wouldn't even know what to do with one.

336
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,303
I never taught him
how to dispose...

337
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:10,143
As far as Miguel knows,
the best place to dispose of a body

338
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,187
is beneath an open grave.

339
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,397
Good thinking.

340
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,828
- Hello.
- Uh, setups are in the kitchen.

341
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,041
- Miguel?
- Hi.

342
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,251
Any bites?

343
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,671
No, just nosy neighbors so far.

344
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:41,341
Syl's office said that she would be here.
Is she out back, or...?

345
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:45,804
No, she wasn't feeling up
to an open house, so I'm sitting it for her.

346
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,141
Well, you're a good friend.

347
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,395
Here. You should have these.

348
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,026
How about I make sure Syl gets them?

349
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,322
Miguel.

350
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,285
Flowers are a good start,
but can I be honest?

351
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,371
I like honest.

352
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,291
- You're an idiot.
- That's honest.

353
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:18,128
You were smart enough
to ask her to marry you,

354
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,255
and she's still
that same fantastic woman.

355
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,675
- You don't think I know that?
- Well, you're not acting that way.

356
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,301
I am not having a goddamn affair, OK?

357
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,554
- All right, let's say that's the truth.
- It is.

358
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:33,059
- Either way, you violated her trust.
- I just needed space.

359
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,478
I've got everything
falling apart around me now,

360
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,273
you know, Oscar, Ramon,
now my cases...

361
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,901
And the same things
are falling apart for her

362
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,862
because she's your partner.

363
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:51,077
You're a wise person, aren't you?

364
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,332
Well, if I am,
it's only because I've learned

365
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:59,294
from my many, many mistakes.

366
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,087
You have insight.

367
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,132
And I tell you what.

368
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,095
I'm gonna follow your lead.

369
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,060
So point the way.

370
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,238
Mr. King, I understand
that respect is very important to you.

371
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,574
Yes, ma'am.

372
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:35,371
And I'm sure you feel
that people have to earn your respect.

373
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,123
Yes, ma'am.

374
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,293
I feel like you've earned this.

375
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,172
What's the matter,
little gardener? Huh?

376
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,132
You feel disrespected?

377
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,844
You'll get used to it in prison
because your foreman Mario's next door,

378
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,846
and he is spilling his guts.

379
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,769
You are so sure
he's afraid of you. Why?

380
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,230
What did you do to him?
What did you do to Anton?

381
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,107
- What did you do?!
- Morgan! Morgan!

382
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,152
Fuck.

383
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,623
Help!

384
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,670
Aah!

385
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,382
Help me!

386
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,224
Hey. We're supposed
to be working together.

387
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,685
You keep going off half-cocked.
How am I supposed to trust you?

388
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,186
You trust me? Unbelievable.

389
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,565
You're lucky Batista wasn't watching the
monitors. What the fuck were you thinking?

390
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:46,025
I was thinking about Anton.
You oughta try it some time.

391
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,319
I want to find him just as bad as you do.

392
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,074
If you gave a shit about Anton,
you wouldn't have made him your fake CI

393
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,701
and he wouldn't be messed up in this.

394
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,704
You were too busy boning him
to provide him with protective surveillance.

395
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,581
You are so crossing the line right now.

396
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,332
Am I?

397
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,042
You knew Anton was in town.

398
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,336
And I fucking told him to call it in.

399
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,506
You should have called it in
your fucking self.

400
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,680
I know. It's my fault.

401
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,682
No.

402
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,059
You're right.

403
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,730
I used him.

404
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:29,652
I... just fucking used him.

405
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:40,496
We can only hold George King
for a few more hours.

406
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,167
We better get back to work.

407
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,928
Schedule says
there are four funerals today.

408
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,680
Graves back-hoed last night.

409
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,391
That's four
Miguel could have chosen from.

410
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,620
She's not here. That's one down.

411
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:32,006
That blood might not even
belong to Ellen.

412
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,264
Could be a client's blood.
Or the previous owner's.

413
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,104
Huh.

414
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,450
He did it.

415
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,202
Miguel really did it.

416
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:05,832
And I taught him how.
I guided him to this.

417
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,667
I created...

418
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,460
this.

419
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,629
I'm sorry.

420
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,819
Miguel's making
his own choices now.

421
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,202
Look who he chose.

422
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,837
She didn't deserve this.

423
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,342
You can say it.

424
00:27:57,468 --> 00:28:01,637
Won't change anything, Dex,
whether I told you so or not.

425
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:03,473
Easier to accept it.

426
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,518
Cause there'll be plenty more
where Ellen came from.

427
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,701
No, there won't.

428
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:36,339
Hey, Miguel, is it too late
to grab that lunch?

429
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,677
So what do you think
of this George King sicko?

430
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,306
- Skinner suspect?
- Mm-hm.

431
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,810
I gotta go from here
to your precinct

432
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:52,939
to discuss whether we're gonna
file charges against this guy.

433
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,776
- You think he's the guy?
- He's the guy.

434
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:57,944
Skinner.

435
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,614
Well, if the law can't get him...

436
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,952
you and I can. In fact...

437
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:09,414
I could have this guy out on the streets
in a few hours.

438
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,753
You need some help on this one,
or is this another solo project?

439
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,929
We agreed to leave
Ellen Wolf alone.

440
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:29,475
Technically, we agreed
not to kill her together. And we didn't.

441
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,646
- Technically?
- I know. That's... That's bullshit.

442
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,649
I didn't tell you
because I know you wouldn't approve.

443
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,942
Cause she wasn't guilty.

444
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,111
We have a different definition of that word.

445
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:43,573
You got rid of her
because she got in your way.

446
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,203
Whatever happened
to serving justice?

447
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,874
Is that really why you do this, Dex?
To serve justice?

448
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,504
- We don't have to pretend with each other.
- That's what I thought.

449
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,381
OK.

450
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,218
I should have told you.

451
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,307
It was a chickenshit thing to do,
and I abused your trust...

452
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:12,018
a trust, by the way,
that wasn't easy to earn.

453
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,228
That's not lost on me.

454
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:19,650
I gave you my shirt
linking me to Freebo's death.

455
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,777
I wish I had another one
to prove to you

456
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,905
how important
this partnership is to me.

457
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,907
I'd take a little remorse.

458
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,034
You would know that I don't feel it.

459
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,495
Yeah, you'll feel it if you get caught.

460
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:33,080
I didn't leave any evidence.

461
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:37,084
They're just gonna think it was
one of her scumbag clients.

462
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,878
Right.

463
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:43,299
Right, just another lowlife
who beat and stabbed an innocent woman.

464
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,182
Again, different definitions.

465
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:57,230
Dex.

466
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,358
This is the nature
of a real friendship.

467
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:03,027
Hmm?

468
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,820
We're gonna disagree.

469
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,073
And when we do,
we just go our own way.

470
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,200
No. No more individual projects.

471
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,994
Individuality is what makes
America great, man.

472
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,413
I don't think that's what
our forefathers had in mind.

473
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,834
Look. I'm a big boy.
I know what I'm doing.

474
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,296
Eventually...

475
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:26,300
you're gonna trust that too.

476
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,970
I'll see you over at the precinct.

477
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,180
He thinks he's untouchable.

478
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,685
He's not. It's time he learned that.

479
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,792
Probably not a lot of leads
on that screen.

480
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,586
King's a ghost.

481
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,423
He grabbed Anton without
a single security camera in the area

482
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,300
picking up him or his truck.

483
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,427
There's not one shot
to implicate him.

484
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,932
So we'll have to get it out of King.

485
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,102
You gonna let Quinn do it on his own?

486
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:24,567
My time is better spent here.

487
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,736
Away from people.

488
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,072
You know, someone,

489
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:33,492
a good friend, actually,

490
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,661
told me I had a big wall around me.

491
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,122
I thought it made me a better cop.

492
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,792
I don't think it did.

493
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:12,073
They look at him
and see a defender of truth, justice,

494
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,200
and the American way.

495
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,911
I see a man about to learn
a hard lesson.

496
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:20,247
Tire tracks in the alley
are consistent with King's truck.

497
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:23,626
And several other thousand trucks
in the Miami Metro area.

498
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:26,545
King's company trims trees.

499
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:29,298
Trimmed trees were found
in every one of the victims' homes.

500
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,802
- That's the lead that nailed him.
- I don't know about nailed.

501
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,554
The trees at my place
just got trimmed too.

502
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,474
- But Mario Astorga...
- We're talking about a foreman.

503
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,351
A foreman who's terrified of his boss.

504
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,937
You can arrest my boss
on that same evidence.

505
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,773
He's the fucking guy.

506
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:50,695
- Sir.
- Miguel. May I?

507
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,867
We really need your help on this one.

508
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,412
And you do owe us
for getting Ramon off.

509
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:03,833
I do. But I can't very well charge Mr. King
with assault on a palm tree.

510
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:08,462
You have your ways, Miguel.
You've bent rules before,

511
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,257
getting people lost in the system.

512
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:15,052
We need to buy time for Anton Briggs.

513
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,350
For you, I'll do everything in my power.

514
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,524
We'll be right there.

515
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,529
Show time.

516
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:36,198
Dex, get your kit. You too, Masuka.

517
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,701
- Hey, it's called off-duty.
- Not any more.

518
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:42,288
You two, you stay on King.
Don't let up. We got another body.

519
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:45,332
Anton?

520
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:47,168
A female at the cemetery.

521
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,281
- Cause of death?
- Take your pick.

522
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,658
Severe beating, strangulation...

523
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,953
plus three stab wounds.

524
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,625
Whoever did this was not a fan.

525
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,543
You have no idea.

526
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,797
I think our killer's a pro. I haven't seen
many body dumps this clean.

527
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:34,089
I made sure of that.

528
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:37,218
Miguel getting caught
isn't part of the lesson plan.

529
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,137
Angel, don't let her see this.

530
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:44,767
No, they said it was her.
But it's not, is it?

531
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,519
Maria, I'm sorry.

532
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,938
No, I don't believe...

533
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,484
- Oh, my God.
- Walk with me.

534
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,201
Too many people are affected
when the innocent die.

535
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:05,496
That is part of the lesson plan.

536
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,418
No one is untouchable.
I learned that the hard way.

537
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:12,837
So will Miguel.

538
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:17,383
His own vulnerability
is about to become very real to him...

539
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,386
after the stage show ends.

540
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,575
- They won't find anything.
- I know.

541
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:46,203
So you're just making a point.

542
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:51,917
- Am I?
- We follow the code. Or else.

543
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,253
There are a lot of other subtleties,

544
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:57,882
but if that's what you've gleaned,
then yeah, that's my point.

545
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,725
You're a wise person, aren't you?

546
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,439
- You're being facetious.
- No, no, you have insight.

547
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:17,735
I'd be a fool not to follow your lead.

548
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:27,453
I think you're gonna save my life.

549
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,416
Is this real?

550
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:35,085
I should go make a statement
to the press.

551
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:39,548
I wouldn't want anyone getting ideas
about killing lawyers.

552
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,140
Lesson learned...

553
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,309
it seems.

554
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:56,148
Oh, good. Good. You're here.

555
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,359
Come here. Taste this.

556
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,530
This one.

557
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,829
And now this one.

558
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,461
Which one?

559
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,130
I'm more in the mood for steak.

560
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,842
No, this is for the wedding cake.

561
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,553
We have to choose one.
Chocolate or hazelnut?

562
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,597
Is Sylvia still here?

563
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,517
No, because of me.

564
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,852
I intervened.

565
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:36,480
Apparently, I'm a very wise person.

566
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,359
Apparently?

567
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:45,447
According to Miguel. He came
to the open house I was sitting for Syl.

568
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,492
- Really?
- We... We talked for a while.

569
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,412
Actually, I talked.
I just... I gave him some insight.

570
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,666
Insight.

571
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,961
He said he thinks I could...

572
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,379
Save his life.

573
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,172
...save his life.

574
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,800
Every word, bullshit.

575
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,885
When did he start lying? With Ellen?

576
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,846
Before her?

577
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:10,389
So, chocolate?

578
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:13,183
What about that shirt?

579
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,686
The shirt.

580
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,440
Dexter, what's wrong?

581
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:22,359
I have to go look at some blood.

582
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,697
Evidence. For a crime.

583
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,615
Hazelnut.

584
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:51,847
Maria, why don't you head home,
get some rest?

585
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,307
I can't.

586
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:56,643
I have to... do something.

587
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,439
Sure. I'm here if you need me. OK?

588
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,288
Tell me that we're close
on the Skinner.

589
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,874
Cause this Ellen Wolf thing
is about to take over.

590
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,126
Still running down tips,
but they're bullshit.

591
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,046
They'll keep being bullshit
because nobody saw King take Anton.

592
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,965
- What about Mario Astorga?
- As tight-lipped as King.

593
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,634
Maybe I can help.

594
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:34,098
She could use a win right now.
We all could.

595
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,766
You gonna charge King?

596
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:38,769
- Not with what you have.
- We release him, he's in the wind.

597
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:39,853
Anton's dead.

598
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,147
So has King asked
for legal counsel yet?

599
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,858
King knows we have nothing on him.
Why would he waste the money?

600
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:48,529
Technically, if he's not represented,
I can't walk in and offer him any deals.

601
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,949
Not on the record, anyway.

602
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,826
Come on. No one'll know the difference.

603
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:57,538
Till a year from now, the recorded document
shows up on CNN, uh-uh.

604
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:01,333
Actually, that camera's been
on the fritz.

605
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,671
It wouldn't surprise me
if it didn't record anything.

606
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:48,422
Freebo's blood.
The link between his murder and Miguel.

607
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:51,383
If I go down,
I can take Miguel with me.

608
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:55,345
A mutual assurance.
A symbol of trust.

609
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,393
- Mm-mm.
- Fuck. That's it?

610
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,188
No way we're gonna let
that monster walk.

611
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:07,399
Are we?

612
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,410
I hope we meet again.

613
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,205
I'd like to get to know you better.

614
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:33,425
But how well
can you really know someone?

615
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,636
How much do you want to know?

616
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,924
There's gotta be something.

617
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,969
All we got is Mario
who won't say shit.

618
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:20,055
We could start skinning him ourselves
before he'd talk.

619
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,267
Morgan, we're not skinning Mario.

620
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,144
I got a better idea.

621
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,105
Wanna share with the whole class?

622
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:32,609
No, just you. I need a partner on this.

623
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,205
Here we are. Home sweet home.

624
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:49,126
It's too bad Anton won't ever get to do that.
Thanks to you.

625
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,673
What?

626
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:00,053
Los ?rboles.

627
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:06,351
Holy shit.

628
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,854
- You told him I revealed things?
- We didn't tell him shit.

629
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,690
He knew you were in holding.
He must have thought you caved.

630
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,358
I didn't tell anyone anything.

631
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,820
I'm sorry. We didn't mean to get
your family caught up in this, all right?

632
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:21,283
- We'll do everything we can to help you.
- What can you do? Nothing!

633
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,495
You're right. We don't even know
where this guy is.

634
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,335
You gotta help me,
or I can't do anything to help you.

635
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,172
Then that's it. I'm sorry.

636
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,924
?Qu? va a pasar? Wait!

637
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:39,843
He has a building.

638
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:43,555
We went through all of his holdings. There's
no record of him owning any building.

639
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,641
He rents it with cash.
He had me go there and pay once.

640
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,561
- He's trying to grow trees to sell.
- Where?

641
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,190
On 164th under the highway.

642
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,358
It's all I know.

643
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:57,569
Mi familia.

644
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:01,573
Go inside. Lock the door.
I'll send a patrol car. Go.

645
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,584
It worked. Get in.

646
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,211
Thank you.

647
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,133
Anton!

648
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,801
Anton, are you in there?

649
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,053
Anton?

650
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,597
Watch out.

651
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,686
Fuck restraint. Here.

652
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,650
Morgan! Get out of the way.

653
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:35,125
It's me. It's OK.

654
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,835
You're safe.

655
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:50,056
I need an ambulance
at the 164 and the 94 ASAP.

656
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:52,517
Get an APB out on George King.

657
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,397
You found me. You found me.

658
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:01,193
You can't get away from me
that easily.

659
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:34,601
And the results are...

660
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:40,899
Maria.

661
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:54,913
Come on. I'll take you home.

662
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:58,500
I can't go home.

663
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,921
There's too much silence.

664
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:11,555
I know.

665
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,563
You don't want to have to think
about what she went through.

666
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,940
- Only to realize that she's really gone.
- Don't.

667
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:25,068
- Pero, coraz?n, she's gone.
- Don't.

668
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:26,945
OK?

669
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:31,074
And that's gonna hurt like hell.
I know that too.

670
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,203
But you have friends.

671
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,414
Hey, hey, hey.

672
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,502
You got me.

673
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:46,047
I'm right here.

674
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:49,384
OK? I'm right here for you.

675
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,678
To get you through.

676
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,097
My, my, my.

677
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:09,571
It's not Freebo's blood.
It's not even human.

678
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:12,115
It's bovine. Cow's blood.

679
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:16,411
He's been using me the whole time.

680
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:19,623
I didn't create a monster,
I was used by one.

681
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:22,417
He used me.

682
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,513
Miguel!

683
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,683
Nine holes tomorrow?

684
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:41,811
You bet.

685
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,659
Today I keep up the pretence.

686
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:58,495
But soon, maybe tomorrow,

687
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:01,748
Miguel will know exactly how I feel

688
