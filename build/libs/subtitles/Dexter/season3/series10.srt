1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,169
Previously on Dexter.

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,129
- Oh, that's pretty.
- Gift from my first husband.

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,381
What'll it be, ladies?

4
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:09,300
How 'bout a foot massage
with those big, gorgeous hands of yours?

5
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,720
- They're kinda cold from scooping ice.
- But you're hot.

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,932
Miguel went missing last night.
Ellen's missing this morning.

7
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:17,934
I hope she didn't get
in an accident or something.

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,561
He did it. Miguel really did it.

9
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:21,688
Ellen.

10
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,648
You don't wanna have to think
about what she went through

11
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,274
to realize that she's really gone.

12
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:28,069
- Don't. Don't.
- Pero, coraz??n, she's gone.

13
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,405
You got me. I'm right here for you.
To get you through.

14
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,741
He's having an affair.
No. You don't know that.

15
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,245
When you've been married as long as we
have, you know when your husband's lying.

16
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,080
Anton is not officially a CI.

17
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,748
We used him as bait.

18
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,166
The Skinner has Anton.

19
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,876
Freebo owes you money?
I can get you money.

20
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,461
I loaned Freebo that money.

21
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,547
This is about respect.

22
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,926
Anton!

23
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,887
Morgan, get outta the way!

24
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,390
You found me.

25
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,350
You can't get away from me that easily.

26
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,937
Anton could so easily file a huge lawsuit
against the police department

27
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,856
once he finds out
how you fucked him over!

28
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,774
You don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about!

29
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,193
You're the one I wanna spend time with.

30
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:13,448
My God... it's perfect.

31
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,908
You should just...
get out while you can.

32
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,119
I won't. I promise.

33
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:22,290
I gave you my shirt
linking me to Freebo's death.

34
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,377
I wish I had another one to prove to you
how important this partnership is to me.

35
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,963
The link between
Freebo's murder and Miguel.

36
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,592
It's not even human.
It's cow's blood. He's been using me.

37
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,636
I didn't create a monster.
I was used by one.

38
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,764
He used me.

39
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,420
How many was it, seven or eight balls?

40
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,921
I lost count.

41
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,216
Putting the 18th tee
in front of a body of water is criminal.

42
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:41,596
I kept on telling him, "Take the mulligan!
Please, take the mullig... "

43
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,806
This one right here, no.

44
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,225
- I finally got one over, didn't I?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:54,400
Just what I ordered - feigned
civility with a heaping side of betrayal.

46
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,820
It's becoming more and more clear
that I'm going to have to deal with Miguel.

47
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,488
Thank you, Chef.

48
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,198
Ah, Chef Babia.

49
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,868
Option one, I kill him.

50
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,120
But he's too high profile.

51
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,332
A popular ADA disappears.
The manhunt would be endless.

52
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:13,044
Everyone he knew would be scrutinized,
and that includes me.

53
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:17,006
He's also my best man.
I'd be expected to grieve.

54
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,467
How about this pumpkin
and sage ravioli here?

55
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,636
- Oh, no, that's...
- There you go.

56
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,639
Option two, get him
the hell out of my life.

57
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:29,268
But it's not that simple. He taught me
how to golf. I taught him how to kill.

58
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:34,023
I'm responsible if Miguel
takes another innocent life.

59
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,817
Tell them, Miguel. I can't wait.

60
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:37,902
Tell us?

61
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,780
We got a wedding present for you.

62
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,282
Chef Babia and his staff,

63
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,743
they're gonna cater your wedding.

64
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,036
Uh, wh...?

65
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,163
We wanted you to have the very best.

66
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,999
- It's too much. Really.
- I won't take no for an answer.

67
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,459
You might have to.

68
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,461
We're doing this for you. I insist.

69
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,174
So much for option two.
He won't just let our partnership dissolve.

70
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,053
He's trying to get me under his thumb,
and he's using Rita to do it.

71
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,513
No...

72
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,058
You are the very best man.

73
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,310
It's working.

74
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,649
OK, so, a toast.

75
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,943
To Dexter and Rita.

76
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,945
May your marriage
be as blessed

77
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,198
as we are to have you
to call friends.

78
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,369
Which leaves option three.

79
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,038
Get him under my thumb...

80
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,624
and keep him there.

81
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,878
God, we're barely moving.

82
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,882
So much for getting Astor home
in time for her bath.

83
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,968
At least the meal was worth it.

84
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,054
And it was great to see Sylvia and Miguel
getting along again.

85
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,183
Do we... have to serve food
at the wedding?

86
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,106
Yes. We have to serve food
at the wedding.

87
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,400
It's just if we can't afford Chef...

88
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,695
what's-his-name on our own,
maybe we shouldn't accept.

89
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:06,407
We can't say no now.
I mean, it would be insulting.

90
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,869
Believe me, Miguel's ego can handle it.

91
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,622
What's going on, Dexter?

92
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:16,042
It's just...

93
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,753
Miguel isn't exactly
who I thought he was.

94
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,589
You two seemed to be
getting along fine at dinner.

95
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,882
Yeah.

96
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,469
Wait a minute. Is this about Sylvia?

97
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,554
I mean, did you find something out?

98
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,097
More than I wanted to.

99
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,933
Oh, my God.
He's cheating on her.

100
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,853
- No, that's not what I...
- Oh, that bastard!

101
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,939
He looked me right in the eye
and said he wasn't having an affair.

102
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,693
Oh, God... poor Syl.

103
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,071
How long has it been going on?

104
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,907
Should I tell her?
What would I say?

105
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,868
I think we should just... stay out of it.

106
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,290
- Is it his secretary?
- It's not his secretary!

107
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,833
Could we please just drop this?

108
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,919
- But there is someone.
- I never said that.

109
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,339
All right, Syl said that Miguel's been
spending a lot of time with Maria LaGuerta,

110
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,050
which makes Syl uncomfortable
because they have history.

111
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,344
- Is that true?
- Yes.

112
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,845
Then that's who it is.

113
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,389
They're spending time together
because of a case.

114
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:13,974
Miguel's brother did die.

115
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,477
Which rekindled the relationship.

116
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,856
That's why you won't say anything.
You're protecting your boss.

117
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,025
Deb. Glad to see ya.

118
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,527
Fight?

119
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:29,240
His best friend is cheating on my best friend
and he won't tell me with who.

120
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,325
You have a best friend?

121
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,828
What'd you use on her, chloroform?

122
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,205
- I hope she was good.
- Aw, she was a champ.

123
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,333
She almost made it through Saw 1 and 2.

124
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,127
I'm kidding.

125
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,170
She was great. We bonded.

126
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,547
Hey.

127
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,674
Oh. Oh, you...

128
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,592
you have company.

129
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,178
Yeah. Um... this is Anton.

130
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,806
Anton Briggs,
the Skinner victim?

131
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,141
Just Anton.

132
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,143
And yes, the Skinner victim.

133
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,691
Uh, you know, your sister...
she saved my life.

134
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,235
Does this mean you're plus one
for the wedding?

135
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:11,240
Uh, we haven't really...
talked about...

136
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,492
Um, so, you're getting married.
Oh, kudos.

137
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,162
- Thanks.
- And a baby on the way.

138
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:21,041
I was hoping to walk down the aisle skinny,
or at least skinnier.

139
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,209
What?

140
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,420
Asshole.

141
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,565
Cocksuck!

142
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,568
Motherfuck!
Anton, wake up. You gotta go.

143
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,737
Fuckin' penguins!

144
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,531
It's just 7:30. I thought
you didn't have to be at work...

145
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,034
Your protective detail's gonna think
that you spent the night!

146
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,578
- I did.
- They're gonna think that we slept together!

147
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,705
- We have, Deb.
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

148
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:03,167
I know, but if they tell my bosses,
I'm gonna get in a shitload of shit!

149
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,169
Really? For sleeping with your boyfriend?

150
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,755
You are a key witness
in a case I'm investigating.

151
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,258
So if that comes out in trial, King's lawyers
are gonna have a fucking field day,

152
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,052
when we catch him.

153
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:17,014
So, um, are you sure
that's what this is really about?

154
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,265
Uh-huh.

155
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,518
Um... I gotta get in the shower,
so I'll call you later, OK?

156
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,938
Yeah. OK.

157
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:30,778
Revisiting option three,
getting Miguel under my thumb.

158
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,279
I need leverage.

159
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,157
Exposing Ellen's body
was supposed to achieve that.

160
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,867
But Miguel wrestled it away.

161
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,953
We have a suspect
for Ellen Wolf's murder.

162
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,207
Is she onto Miguel,
and do I smell leverage?

163
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,584
Toby Edwards, 32.

164
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,794
Oh, well.

165
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,755
Ellen's incoming phone records
show that he called her house three times

166
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:54,051
on the night of her murder - once at
11:10pm from the bar where he works,

167
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:59,139
and then twice more at 3:01 and 3:08am
from right outside her house.

168
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,977
She hasn't found the killer,
but she might have found a witness.

169
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,436
And I found my leverage.

170
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,481
Soderquist, vamos. Get an address
on this guy. Haul his ass in.

171
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,985
We're also getting a search warrant.
We're looking for a platinum wedding ring.

172
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,362
I've already catalogued
one wedding ring into evidence.

173
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,155
Well, she wore two.

174
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,657
One for each ex-husband.

175
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,076
Well, why would the killer
only take one ring?

176
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,036
Maybe he got interrupted.

177
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,372
Or he wanted a trophy.

178
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,500
Whatever it is,
we're gonna find out.

179
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,669
A potential witness, a missing ring.

180
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,505
Now Miguel and I have
something to talk about.

181
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,342
Hey, not so fast.
Not so fast.

182
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,012
I am taking donations
for Dexter Morgan's...

183
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,179
bachelor party.

184
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,349
Produced and directed by Vince Masuka,
a Vince Masuka production.

185
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,643
Dig deep now.
It's gonna be off the charts.

186
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,562
I'm gonna have Sergeant Cop-a-Feel,

187
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,440
Jo-Jo the Lezbo Go-Go,
Maureen the Limber Mermaid,

188
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,985
and her even more limber friend
Nadia the Russian gymnast.

189
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,363
What?

190
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,074
Vince, we're in the middle
of two big investigations.

191
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,036
Tell me about it. It's hard
to get people focused on this shindig.

192
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,705
What I mean is that maybe you
should keep the party low-key.

193
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,583
Are you kidding?
I've got a reputation to live up to.

194
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,710
I mean, if my show
does not make people vomit

195
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,005
and have an erection at the same time,
then I've let my audience down.

196
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,925
Strippers, yes. Hookers, no.
And none of that weird shit that you're into.

197
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:20,179
- Wow. OK, Sergeant Buzzkill.
- I mean it.

198
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,389
Anything illegal, I will arrest you.

199
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,601
Come on. I was just joking.
The party's for Opie out there.

200
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,103
A hooker is a terrible thing to waste.

201
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,901
Damn it.

202
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,445
I'm never gonna get my deposit back.

203
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,322
Yes, ma'am, your landscaper.

204
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,616
When was the last time you saw him?

205
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,287
OK. Do you have any empty structures
on your property

206
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,123
or unoccupied vacation homes
in the area?

207
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,461
Right, ma'am, we'll be sure to clear 'em
as fast as we can

208
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,296
so you don't have to re-sod your lawn,

209
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,298
you fuckhead.

210
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,593
What's this?

211
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,805
Surveillance report
from Anton's protective detail.

212
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,348
Very thorough.

213
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,183
He came over on official business.

214
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,602
Which took all night.

215
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,978
Sarge is gonna see that.

216
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:13,107
I'll tell him the truth,
that nothing happened.

217
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,275
So you're no longer
sleeping with the...

218
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,319
key witness in this investigation?

219
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,363
What's it to you?

220
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,865
You're right. It's your shield.

221
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,326
If you want people talkin',
be my guest.

222
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,790
You've run out of people
to transfer me to?

223
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,501
Your embassy isn't that big.
?yeme...

224
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,629
George Washington King.

225
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,173
No, no, no, do not transfer me back.
Esc??chame...

226
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,467
Homicide.

227
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,095
Sarge, line two. Says it's urgent.

228
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,599
Sergeant Batista.

229
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,273
I'll be right there.

230
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,944
- Cover for me.
- Is everything OK?

231
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,612
No.

232
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,658
It's all about strategy,
outmaneuvering the opposition,

233
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,201
bending him to your will.

234
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,958
What are you doing in my office, Dex?

235
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,629
Winning.

236
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,925
Hope you don't mind. Just keeping
my wits sharp while I waited for you.

237
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:26,013
You, uh, here to grab...
lunch or something?

238
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,391
Can't. Gotta get back to the station.

239
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,728
The Ellen Wolf case is breaking.

240
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,688
Breaking.

241
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,106
Which way?

242
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,651
It seems Lieutenant LaGuerta
has a suspect.

243
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,195
And who might that be?

244
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,739
Some guy who was...

245
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,493
outside Ellen's place round about the time
she was gettin' strangled.

246
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,539
Or was she stabbed first?
I can't remember.

247
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,374
He couldn't have seen anything.

248
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,633
You sure?

249
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,387
All right.

250
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,097
So what do we do?

251
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,891
We?

252
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,142
Huh.

253
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,729
We are partners.

254
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,441
Yeah, but see,
here's the thing, Miguel.

255
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,944
I don't really want a partner.

256
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,364
Hey, I'm not giving up
on our friendship, Dex.

257
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,241
Hell, I'm standing up at your wedding.

258
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,869
Yeah. But after that,
you go your own way.

259
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,456
And we both go back
to who we were before all of this -

260
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,293
you an honorable ADA
dedicated to upholding the law of the land...

261
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,255
- And you?
- A trusty spatter analyst

262
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,965
who always gets his killer.

263
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,097
In exchange for what?

264
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:55,185
I'm in a position to protect
the ADA's interests in this case.

265
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,855
I'll do what it takes to keep
the innocent people of Miami safe.

266
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,075
And that's what you want?

267
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,580
That's what I want.

268
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,923
Game over.

269
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,019
- Barbara Gianna?
- In there.

270
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,979
- What do we know?
- Not much.

271
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,440
The meds for the pain have her pretty blurry.

272
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,318
Hey, you that, uh, homicide guy
she keeps talkin' about?

273
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:48,405
- She talks about me?
- She says you snore like a motherfucker.

274
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,206
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

275
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,337
How you doing?

276
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:07,633
I feel like I got a Buick
parked on my head.

277
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,511
Wasn't raped...
if that's what you were thinking.

278
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,096
I just got beat on a little.

279
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,058
By who? Any ideas?

280
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,518
Mm, best I can tell...

281
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:22,022
some would-be john
saw me on the stroll.

282
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,191
Asshole followed me home.

283
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,026
So you got a look at him.

284
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,235
Mm-hm.

285
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:30,614
Tall, blond, good-looking.

286
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,907
Mm.

287
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,742
Strong.

288
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,746
My weapon was in my purse.

289
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,248
All I had were my keys.

290
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,043
Got my licks in.

291
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,544
He'll be a little...

292
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,214
less handsome tomorrow.

293
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,304
You did good.

294
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,059
- I'm glad you're here.
- Hell, yeah, I'm here.

295
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,396
You're not gonna go through this alone.

296
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,898
And, uh, just for the record...

297
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,195
I don't snore like a motherfucker.

298
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:14,616
Excuse me... we need to get
Detective Gianna upstairs for a cat scan,

299
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,868
- see if we can release her.
- Release her?

300
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:20,205
- I'm not that bad, Angel.
- Of course you're not.

301
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,171
I'll talk to you later, OK?

302
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,563
Detective Gianna thinks she got
a piece of the assailant with these.

303
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:48,442
You're looking for a blond guy, tall.
Could be a john.

304
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,820
Maybe one of your other decoys
might have seen him.

305
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,574
We're all over this. Thanks, Sergeant.

306
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,368
Get this down to the lab fast.

307
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,587
Angel.

308
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,505
What can I do you for?

309
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,467
I, uh, need you to test this for blood.

310
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,303
If it comes back positive,
run it through the criminal database.

311
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,140
No prob.
Might take a day or two for sequencing.

312
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,602
Uh, grease it.
I mean, it's... it's a priority.

313
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,270
- Sure.
- Thanks.

314
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,981
Is this Ellen Wolf or the Skinner?
There's no case number.

315
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,691
Uh, it's...

316
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:33,111
It's more of... an internal thing.

317
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,322
You know? My eyes only.

318
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,365
Your eyes only.

319
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:38,909
Thanks.

320
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,503
I'm not hiding anything. I swear.

321
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,047
You were coming on to Ellen. I was there.

322
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:56,551
She came on to me. I flirted back.

323
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,178
It's part of the job, you know?

324
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,430
How you earn tips.

325
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,142
She left me 20 on a $30 tab.

326
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,062
You figured there was more
where that came from.

327
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:10,524
You called her again at 11:10pm,

328
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:16,321
then at 3:01 and 3:08am. That's pretty
late to be calling someone you just met.

329
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,198
I called on my break.

330
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,867
I told her I didn't get off work till after two.

331
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,786
She said to come over anyway.

332
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,124
And then I called again to tell her I wasn't
going to make it. She didn't answer.

333
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:33,004
I called one more time just in case.
No one picked up.

334
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,341
For someone so innocent,
he sure looks guilty.

335
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,677
Looks like a killer to me.

336
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,847
- He's not.
- Well, but he could be.

337
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,226
You wanna know
what I think happened?

338
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:51,690
I think that you showed up at her house
unannounced, looking for sex.

339
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,567
She wouldn't give it up,
you lost your temper.

340
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:54,943
That's not what happened.

341
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:58,113
Then you called twice to make it look like
you thought she was still alive.

342
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,407
That's crazy. You're not listening to me.

343
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,033
Any priors?

344
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,996
You seem to have a problem
with the word "innocent".

345
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,123
No one's getting framed for this.

346
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,625
- Hey, your ball game.
- Why are you here?

347
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,294
Curiosity.

348
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,170
You can't blame me, can you?

349
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:19,134
- So you didn't go over to her house?
- No. I went home.

350
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,094
You're fucking lying, Toby.

351
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,932
These two calls were routed through
a cell phone tower a block from her house.

352
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,894
- You were there!
- All right!

353
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,273
I have a fianc?©e...

354
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,194
...who's not gonna like
hearing about a booty call.

355
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,906
So you went there.
She changed her mind.

356
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,074
- You got angry...
- No. No!

357
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,410
I mean, yes, I went to her place,

358
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,913
but she didn't answer the door.

359
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,541
So I called - twice.

360
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,962
I figured she fell asleep.
I went home. I swear to God.

361
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,798
- Not much of a suspect.
- Not much of a witness.

362
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,636
Lieutenant, do you have a second?

363
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,888
Hmm. New development.

364
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,348
Never know what'll pop up.

365
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,392
Well... I'll know.

366
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,061
I'll keep you posted, as promised.

367
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,397
You're a good friend to have.
I'm just gonna stay here.

368
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,066
My curiosity's piqued.

369
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,318
He's lying through his teeth.

370
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,445
We can put him at the scene.

371
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,989
He's, uh, not our guy.

372
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,158
The fuck he's not.

373
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,160
Four people put him at the bar all night long.

374
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,581
And there's security camera footage of him
closing out when the vic went down.

375
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:35,377
The vic's name is Ellen,
and he was there. He's our guy.

376
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:39,172
The time code on the tape checks out.
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

377
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,516
You were there
at three in the morning.

378
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,643
Did you see anyone else on the street?

379
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,521
- No. It was dead.
- No unusual activity?

380
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,440
There was some douchebag
with his high beams on.

381
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,318
- Blinding me.
- So someone was on the street.

382
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,029
He was coming the other direction
when I pulled up.

383
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,658
Actually, it wasn't high beams.

384
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:10,161
It was those big-ass halogens.

385
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,498
What kind of car?

386
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,916
SUV.

387
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,836
Dark. Blue.

388
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:21,506
Black. I-I-I don't know!
Something like that.

389
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,512
I am indeed a good friend to have.

390
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,311
And one can never have
too many friends, right?

391
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,566
My friend Miguel
isn't giving up without a fight.

392
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:43,028
He'll do whatever's necessary
to regain the upper hand.

393
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,990
If he controls LaGuerta,
he controls the investigation,

394
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:50,160
and my leverage disappears.

395
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,204
But she's a tough sell.
He won't get far.

396
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,749
I hope.

397
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:57,083
Ta-da!

398
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,335
Ta-da!

399
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,301
You...

400
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,095
are so... beautiful!

401
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,140
Oh...

402
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,266
All right.

403
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,436
Now, you come over here
and admire yourself

404
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,688
while Nina checks the fit.

405
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,818
I feel like Cinderella.

406
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,946
Except for the whole
Disney virgin thing.

407
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,573
Oh, don't worry.

408
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:31,409
No one'll know Prince Charming
knocked ya up before the ball.

409
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,288
Hey, Syl, are you OK?

410
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:39,250
Yeah. I was just remembering
my wedding day.

411
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,628
I was never happier.

412
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:46,007
- It's supposed to get even better over time.
- Sweetie, your marriage will, I'm sure of it.

413
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,927
Things still aren't great with Miguel?

414
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,471
Well, we're working on it.

415
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,681
At least I am.

416
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,728
- And what's he doing?
- I wish I knew.

417
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,941
Do you? Really?

418
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,158
What the hell are you doing in here?

419
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,993
Forensics.

420
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,453
On which case?

421
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,499
The new bean-counter
is questioning this lab request.

422
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:24,212
- What is this key that you're testing?
- It's, uh... It's for an investigation.

423
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:27,841
Then put an active case number on it, OK?
With all these budget cuts,

424
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:31,469
they're flagging everything and coming
straight to me with all this bullshit

425
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,347
which I really don't need right now,
Dexter, OK? I don't need it.

426
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,307
OK. I'll straighten it out.

427
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,232
I'm sorry. I just...

428
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,859
No. I'll take care of it.

429
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,531
She's ripe for the picking,
and Miguel knows it.

430
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,575
He'll use her to protect himself.

431
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:57,036
And there goes my leverage.
Better keep an eye on her.

432
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:00,665
No, no, no, no. You can't cancel.
The party's in two days.

433
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,585
You're sorry?

434
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:08,631
Well, you can take your sorry
and shove it up your ass!

435
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,383
Fuck!

436
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,139
The erotic clowns just cancelled.
Why is this wedding happening to me?

437
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,891
Bro, let me help you out.

438
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:21,853
I've been the best man
at more weddings than I can count.

439
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,190
Never a groom, thank Christ,
but I've planned a ton of these.

440
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:27,233
Platinum Enterprises?

441
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,196
It's a full-service operation,
party boat, food, alcohol.

442
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,948
One phone call, and you're done.
Ask for Tammy.

443
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:37,911
God bless you, Joseph Quinn.

444
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,585
Hey. He lives.

445
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,087
- Hey, man.
- Good to see you up and moving, man.

446
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,882
Thanks, thanks.
Um... Morgan, she here?

447
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,259
Uh, no, she's out.

448
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,429
Running down a file
on the bastard who did this to you.

449
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,599
- We're gonna find him, Anton, I swear.
- Yeah, I know.

450
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,101
Hey, I just wanted to say,

451
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:06,147
I never meant for any of this to go down
the way it did, you know?

452
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,482
You didn't sign up for this.

453
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:13,321
Listen, I was the idiot who got busted in
the first place, right? So... it's kind of on me.

454
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:18,576
Yeah, but it was me thinking I was doing
you a favor keeping you off the books.

455
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,621
I should have told you
you were free and clear. I messed up.

456
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,748
I wanted to apologize to your face.

457
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:27,794
Deb told me that was a clerical error.

458
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:32,465
- So that was you?
- Yeah. I assumed she told you.

459
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,136
You lying son of a bitch!
You almost got me killed!

460
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,346
Shit!

461
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:41,182
- It's all right. Let him go.
- What the hell is this?

462
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,892
Ramos, let him go. Let him go!

463
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,147
This shit ain't over, man.

464
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,108
Anton...

465
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,737
- You OK?
- Yeah.

466
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,327
Anton, stop.
Goddamn it, will you just stop?

467
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,870
His punk ass deserved it!

468
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:05,248
You can't just walk into a police station
and punch a cop!

469
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,708
Here you are standin' up for him.

470
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,836
- I am not the enemy here.
- Debra, you lied to me!

471
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,671
Clerical error, my ass.

472
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:15,925
Quinn kept me as his CI bitch
when I could have walked away at any time.

473
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,593
You're right, I lied.

474
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,471
But telling you wasn't
gonna change what he did.

475
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,390
I almost died because of that prick.

476
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,767
Without that prick,
we wouldn't have found you.

477
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,186
You'll be lucky if he doesn't press charges.

478
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:30,857
What? Let him!
I'll sue this whole fucking department!

479
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,067
Don't talk like that.

480
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,070
I'll talk to Quinn.

481
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,448
Really?

482
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:42,076
Sure you're not afraid he might find out
we're sleeping together

483
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,704
- and tell everyone?
- He already knows.

484
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,373
And he hasn't told anyone.
Where the hell did that come from?

485
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,711
From your brother's surprised face
when he met me, Debra.

486
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,504
From your boot on my butt

487
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,799
- kickin' me out the door this morning.
- Are you serious?

488
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,886
I am this close to getting my shield,
and I'm putting it all at risk to be with you!

489
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,347
Then, Debra, why are you?

490
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,350
You feel guilty?

491
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,103
You feel responsible
for what happened to me?

492
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,486
Shit. You're bleeding.

493
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,532
You're gonna need new stitches.

494
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,826
Debra, I tell you what I'm gonna need.

495
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:31,125
I need for you to seriously
think about this.

496
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,211
Think about us.

497
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,349
No, no, para m?­, no.

498
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,434
I think I've had enough.

499
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,520
Wine...

500
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:54,482
invented for the sole purpose
of handling grief.

501
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,025
Hmm?

502
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,778
Believe me, I know.

503
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,906
When Oscar died,
I drowned my share of sorrow.

504
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,411
I know how you feel.
You miss her.

505
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,790
Just... Just...

506
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,585
Last Thursday,
I was having drinks with her.

507
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,629
And then the next day,

508
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,258
I'm staring down at her dead body.

509
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,972
If you're gonna end up in a grave,
it should at least be your own.

510
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,058
And so the only thing you got to go on
right now is that SUV, huh?

511
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,936
We're checking every
intersection surveillance camera

512
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,397
from Ellen's place to the cemetery.

513
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,315
Good. Good.

514
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:40,862
Thorough.

515
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,117
See, she's lucky to have you
watchin' out for her.

516
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:50,496
It's just like you watched out for me
with Oscar's case.

517
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,498
Some good that did.

518
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,959
Hey, Maria, come on.

519
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,753
You helped me.

520
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,132
You helped me.

521
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,636
You've always been important to me.
You know that.

522
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,684
You remember that weekend
when we took Oscar with us to the Keys?

523
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,021
I kept telling him,
"I am not sharing...

524
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:18,524
"the hottest girl in Florida
with my baby brother. "

525
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,527
And then you talked me
into letting him come.

526
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,488
He was so cute.

527
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:27,450
- Those skinny little legs.
- Mm-hm.

528
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,912
Up until that weekend, he was always
my annoying kid brother, you know?

529
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,872
Always in the way.

530
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,416
And then when
he was taken from me,

531
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:39,629
I kept on thinking back
to that weekend... you know?

532
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:43,216
Cause that's the way
I wanna remember him, like you said.

533
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,676
You know,
before all the drugs

534
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:49,013
and all the run-ins
with the cops and all that.

535
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:55,102
That little boy
with the skinny legs, my brother.

536
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,856
Sorry.

537
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:06,030
I wouldn't have had that memory
if it wasn't for you.

538
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,200
Seriously.

539
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:11,869
Thank you.

540
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,080
Gracias.

541
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,232
I miss that.

542
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,035
Oh, man, I don't know
what came over me.

543
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,538
It's OK. It's OK.

544
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,547
Hey, Lieutenant, I am sorry
to show up unannounced.

545
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,633
I know it's late, but I feel so bad
about that case number screw-up,

546
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,719
and I just wanted to...

547
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,012
Miguel.

548
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:14,307
- I'm interrupting.
- No, we're just, um...

549
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,434
- Casework.
- Talking casework.

550
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,437
If this was so urgent, Dexter,
you could have called me.

551
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,856
I know, I'm sorry. It's just...

552
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:24,066
I feel bad,
and this is too important.

553
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,987
The key I tested came from a colleague
in Monroe County.

554
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,406
His department
doesn't have our resources,

555
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,950
and I did him a favor. I'm sorry.

556
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,536
I know how you value the truth.

557
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:39,457
Look, don't worry about it.
Just let me know next time.

558
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,125
OK.

559
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,585
And call first.

560
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,713
Again, I'm... sorry to interrupt.

561
00:32:56,642 --> 00:33:00,102
I couldn't let LaGuerta become
Miguel's collateral damage.

562
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,521
I need to keep his focus on me.

563
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,940
After tonight, I have his full attention.

564
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,365
Hey, there.

565
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,660
Please don't hate me,
but I may have done a bad thing.

566
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,329
Do I need to sit down?

567
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,165
I told Sylvia about Miguel and LaGuerta.

568
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,125
I'm gonna sit down.

569
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,836
I was trying on my dress.
We were talking about the wedding.

570
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,547
She seemed so sad.
I mean, I had to say something, didn't I?

571
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,509
- I suppose you did.
- So she called Miguel's office,

572
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:34,637
and his assistant said that he was
meeting with Lieutenant LaGuerta,

573
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,848
but then Syl checked with your precinct,
and neither of them is there.

574
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,184
So... she thinks Miguel
is at LaGuerta's?

575
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,229
What do you think she's gonna do?

576
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,741
- I'll call you tomorrow, hmm?
- About the case?

577
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,785
Sure. At the office.

578
00:33:58,704 --> 00:33:59,870
Maria...

579
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,872
You fucker!

580
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:06,085
- You are too good a liar, Miguel.
- Syl, what are you doing here?

581
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,170
I don't know when you're telling the truth
any more.

582
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,047
You say you're at work. I believe you.

583
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,383
You say you're not having an affair.
I believe you.

584
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,552
Syl, nothing happened here, OK?

585
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,762
- I swear to you.
- You swore to me last Thursday...

586
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,180
when you were out all night.

587
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,142
You swore to me
you weren't with another woman.

588
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,436
But now I think you were here.

589
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,564
- Wait. Last Thursday, he was not...
- You...

590
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:33,112
You'll probably be a lot better
at seeing through his bullshit than I was,

591
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,572
being a detective and all.

592
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,991
- Good luck.
- Syl, come on, ven.

593
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,243
Don't touch me. I'm done!

594
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,621
- Syl.
- Get out of my life!

595
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,098
She... She's got it all wrong.

596
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,560
I'll straighten it out. All right?

597
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,006
- Hey, Francisco!
- What'll it be today, Mr. Morgan?

598
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,133
Olvidate, que ese pide lo de siempre.

599
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,678
I said you'd take the usual.

600
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,683
You're a creature...

601
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,560
of habit.

602
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,604
Come on, take a seat.
While you wait.

603
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,742
Kind of a bitch move there, man.

604
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,536
Sending my wife over to Maria's.

605
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,663
Surprisingly, it wasn't me.

606
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,164
Sure.

607
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,875
You wouldn't play games
with a man's family,

608
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,002
or, uh...

609
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,213
cause pain to an innocent woman.

610
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,553
Neither would I. That's why I wanted
to give you a heads up

611
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:25,057
that my office is talking about doing
a little ethics probe on your sister.

612
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,018
Cops don't come any cleaner than Deb.

613
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,230
Yeah, huh?
Like, uh, sleeping with a CI?

614
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:37,152
Cause it's all here in this surveillance report
for... what's-his-name, I got it right here.

615
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,989
Anton Briggs.

616
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:44,076
Now, mi'jito,
this don't look so good.

617
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,911
Pero...

618
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,414
I'm gonna keep a close eye on it...

619
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:53,210
just like you're gonna keep a close eye
on Ellen's case for me.

620
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,546
And any other favor I might have.

621
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,840
The usual, Mr. Morgan.

622
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,595
Here.

623
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:05,806
It's a copy.

624
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,600
Cause after all...

625
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,519
familia is sacred.

626
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,522
Right?

627
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,568
He has no idea
what door he just opened.

628
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:20,654
Mr. Dexter.

629
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,031
Hey, Norma.

630
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:24,116
The Prados, they're not home.

631
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,618
That's what I was hoping.

632
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,579
Did you know that Miguel
is gonna be best man for my wedding?

633
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,540
Yeah. I heard him talking about it
with Mrs. Sylvia.

634
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,959
Well, the groom is supposed
to buy his best man a gift.

635
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,545
And I know how much Miguel
loves Garcia M??rquez,

636
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,965
so I thought I'd pick up
a limited edition of one of his books.

637
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,842
Oh, he would like that very much.

638
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,470
Do you think it'd be all right
if I looked in Miguel's den

639
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,889
just to see what he already has?

640
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,265
Our secret.

641
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,476
OK.

642
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,936
Come in.

643
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,107
I'll be out in a jiffy.

644
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,692
OK.

645
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,500
Miguel stepped over a line,
and he'll keep stepping

646
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:18,462
until I have something he can't top,
something that could put him in jail,

647
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,631
if and when I want him there.

648
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,723
That's the only way he'll back off.

649
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,935
I know Miguel killed Ellen Wolf.

650
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:36,438
And I know he took
one of her rings as a trophy.

651
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,818
The question is, where did he hide it?

652
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,996
Somewhere no one else
would ever look.

653
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,840
Unless...

654
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,844
Unless they're me.

655
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,157
No more games.

656
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,414
Hi. Are you Vince?

657
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,999
Yeah.

658
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,376
I'm Tammy Okama.
Platinum Enterprises.

659
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,087
- May I sit?
- Yeah, sure.

660
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,260
- You're Tammy?
- Mm-hm.

661
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,220
I was expecting someone...

662
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,889
- Trashy?
- Yeah.

663
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,849
That's sweet.

664
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,560
So! We are planning a bachelor party.

665
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:59,730
Yeah, but, uh, keep it down,
because party boy's in the next room.

666
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,440
Oh! Well...

667
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:05,861
we have any number of themes
you can choose from.

668
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,364
Well, uh... what's your favorite?

669
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:12,117
Mm. I'd stick with a nautical theme.

670
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:16,121
- Riverboat casino, pirates in petticoats.
- Nautical's good.

671
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,917
Mm-hm. You have such nice eyes, Vince.

672
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,304
Hey, Dex, I got your message.
Did you get a DNA match on that key?

673
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,723
Uh, seems so.

674
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,308
Thank you.

675
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,102
I mean it.

676
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,438
So where's the report?

677
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,611
If Angel wants to kill this guy,
that's his business.

678
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,446
I'm done getting involved with friends.

679
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:52,241
I heard LaGuerta gave you shit for this.

680
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,700
It's all right.

681
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,494
But I knew that I can trust you.

682
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,788
Don't get involved.

683
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,166
I heard about Detective Gianna.
How is she?

684
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,751
What are you doing?

685
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,379
OK. No concussion.

686
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,715
Dex, the... the file.

687
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:10,300
Yep.

688
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,265
I know how hard it must have been
to see her like that.

689
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,350
I know what it is to...

690
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:22,146
want to rebalance an unbalanced world.

691
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:24,022
But it's just...

692
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,900
unbalanced, Angel, and that's it.

693
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,569
OK.

694
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:31,238
- OK.
- Some doors should stay shut.

695
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,368
You open it, it's too easy
to walk through it a second time.

696
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,539
I've seen it before. Recently, even.

697
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,297
I'll keep it in mind.

698
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,801
Thanks, Dex.

699
00:41:56,723 --> 00:42:00,767
Well, at least I didn't teach him
how to get away with murder. I'm learning.

700
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,489
Thought you said you'd be gone
by the time I got back.

701
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:18,035
I'm just getting some work stuff here.

702
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,537
Just make sure you get everything.

703
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,081
I don't want you using it
as an excuse to come back.

704
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,958
Syl, look, I...

705
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,919
Jeez.

706
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,212
Damn it!

707
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:09,586
Please, sir,
this stain just wouldn't come out.

708
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:14,383
You know, once blood sets,
it's really hard to get out, so no charge.

709
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,156
Devon Parks?

710
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,167
Hey, Deb,

711
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:52,963
I wanted to talk to you
about the thing you got going with your CI.

712
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,340
Well, he's not a CI.

713
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,801
And we don't have anything going,
not anymore.

714
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:59,469
Well, that settles that.

715
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,723
Only a retard would have gotten involved
with Anton in the first place.

716
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:05,600
I don't know.
He seemed like a nice enough guy.

717
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:08,186
You seemed to like him.

718
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:13,150
When he went missing, all I could think was,
"Please, God, don't let him be dead. "

719
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,444
And then I get him back,

720
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,863
and all I can think is...

721
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,990
how wrong he is for me.

722
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:23,827
You know, like...
how bad it makes me look.

723
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,830
Doesn't matter that he makes me happy

724
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:30,542
or he makes me feel how you're supposed
to feel when you're with the right person.

725
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,294
Is that crazy?

726
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:37,883
I got nothin'.

727
00:44:41,054 --> 00:44:42,637
God.

728
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,474
You are useless.

729
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:49,061
Love you anyway.

730
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,468
- Think this is funny?
- Not at all.

731
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:24,388
- They said that stain would come out!
- Fuck you!

732
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:27,265
I didn't get to where I am, who I am,

733
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:30,936
by letting some little gusano like you
walk all over me! Where's my ring?

734
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:33,730
It's not your ring. It's Ellen's.

735
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,108
Though you did leave
a nice, clean print on it.

736
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,902
Oh, there's plenty of blood
on your hands too!

737
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:41,321
Ethan Turner, Clemson Galt.

738
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:44,699
All deserving,
with nothing to tie me to their deaths

739
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,827
and no bodies to prove
that they're even dead.

740
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,829
Maybe in a court of law.

741
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,956
But how's that little bride of yours gonna feel

742
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,166
when she has to start
answering some questions?

743
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:57,671
Cause she's gotta wonder where you go,
what you do, who you really are.

744
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:00,590
She knows everything she needs to,
and it's gonna stay that way

745
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,844
or that ring might show up
someplace very inconvenient.

746
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,138
I am the last person you wanna fuck with,

747
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:08,306
because I will fuck you back

748
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:11,309
in ways you never even imagined!

749
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,523
An anonymous tip,
couple of search warrants. Hmm?

750
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:21,111
Who knows what the police might find in
your apartment or in that little boat of yours.

751
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,237
You got the ring!

752
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:25,657
I got City fucking Hall!

753
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,701
Wow. I didn't get it before, Miguel,

754
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:31,204
but you can't be reasoned with,
guilted, controlled.

755
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,124
This whole back-and-forth game
for leverage is pointless.

756
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,377
That's right!
I'll do what I want, when I want,

757
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:40,046
to whomever I want!
Count on it!

758
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,841
I will.

759
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,600
Thank you.

760
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:07,699
Harry was right.
He's always been right.

761
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,952
There are the innocent,
and there are the deserving.

762
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,455
Have Barbara Gianna ID this guy.

763
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:16,458
Some doors should stay closed.

764
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,711
Some people can understand that.

765
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,633
Harry also said it's all about choices.

766
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:28,970
Good and bad.

767
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:44,361
My search for connection
always ends in blood.

768
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,452
You get a good look at him?

769
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:56,748
Yes. How do I know
this is not a trap?

770
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,292
Oye. If I wanted you in jail,

771
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:02,587
I wouldn't have let you loose
in the first place, OK?

772
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:06,466
And you believe this man
knows where Freebo is?

773
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,468
He's the only one who does.

774
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,345
His name?

775
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,641
Dexter Morgan.

776
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:16,476
You want Freebo,

777
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,436
you want your money...

778
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:25,527
then you need to have
a long conversation with him.

779
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:30,699
Even Harry would agree
Miguel has left me no other choice.

780
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:34,244
As challenging as it will be,
it's back to option one.

781
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,372
I kill him.
