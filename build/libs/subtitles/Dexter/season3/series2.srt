1
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,520
Previously,on dexter...

2
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,120
God,you're on fire.

3
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,450
Oh,shit. what?

4
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,450
I'm pregnant.

5
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,490
I just got word Angel will be

6
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,720
Detective sergeant batista.

7
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,290
Fred bowman,a.k.a. freebo,

8
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,620
Kills two college girls

9
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,690
And escapes on a state police screw-up.

10
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,390
Looking to hold some product.

11
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,120
I need a hit.

12
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,450
Did you hear what I said?

13
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,750
Fuck off,teegan.

14
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,250
Fine,I guess your dick can suck itself from now on!

15
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,690
Freebo,get back here!

16
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,590
Who are you?

17
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,950
Who are you?

18
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,550
I got it,dex. got what?

19
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,420
Only the case that's gonna get me my shield.

20
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,290
It's huge. angel put me on it.

21
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,390
Who he is

22
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,690
Is what makes this case huge.

23
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,090
It's miguel prado,

24
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,990
Assistant district attorney.

25
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,290
He and laguerta go way back.

26
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,290
The other guy's ramon prado,

27
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,120
Miguel's middle brother.

28
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,550
He's a lieutenant with the sheriff's department.

29
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,920
And...

30
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,950
Oscar.

31
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,120
Prado?

32
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,720
As in baby brother.

33
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,950
I've never killed anyone

34
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,150
I didn't completely vet before,

35
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,450
Whose guilt I wasn't absolutely certain of.

36
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,350
Oscar prado tried to kill freebo.

37
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,550
Then he tried to kill me.

38
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,050
He's gotta be guilty of something.

39
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,950
Why would a blood spatter analyst

40
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,990
Spend time searching for information

41
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,690
On my dead brother?

42
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,750
This one,this death got to me.

43
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,220
Morgan,right? do I know you?

44
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,950
Yuki amado,internal affairs.

45
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,950
And?

46
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,350
You know joey quinn?

47
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,350
I'm gonna do you a favor.

48
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,490
Call this guy,

49
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,450
Tell him you wanna cash in one of my coupons.

50
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,020
He's an informant from my days in narcotics.

51
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,690
You're anton?

52
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,790
You got something you need to show me?

53
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,020
What about this prado guy?

54
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,850
Oh,yeah,I've seen him before.

55
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,250
Oscar prado was into freebo for some serious cash.

56
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,120
You getting along with the new boss man?

57
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,250
Ah,fuck him.

58
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,420
He took me off the oscar prado case

59
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,520
And put me on this.

60
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,950
Some dead-end jane doe.

61
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,350
Teegan. freebo's girlfriend.

62
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,250
Looks like he's still in miami.

63
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,190
We're supposed to see hope in children.

64
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,520
But right now,all I see are little bundles of uncertainty.

65
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,250
And germs.

66
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,390
But that's another matter.

67
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,420
I love kids.

68
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,450
I can play with them,enjoy them...

69
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,150
And leave.

70
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,690
I don't have to worry about what they'll become.

71
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,250
A nobel prize laureate.

72
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,050
A drunk.

73
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,190
President of the united states.

74
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,220
Or someone like me.

75
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,590
Why do parents take the chance?

76
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,820
I've never felt compelled.

77
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,090
But why would i?

78
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,890
I'm not in the business of giving life.

79
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,950
It's for sure.

80
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,190
I'm pregnant,heh.

81
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,950
What should we do?

82
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,950
I don't know.

83
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,150
We should talk.

84
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,990
Weigh all the options.

85
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,920
Together.

86
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,090
I have to get to work.

87
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,920
Weighing options. the pros and cons.

88
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,950
Something I'm good at,usually.

89
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,950
What the fuck,dex?

90
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,020
I was yelling at you to hold the elevator,ass-wipe.

91
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,120
Sorry,I'm feeling off.

92
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,690
So see a doctor.

93
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,350
Saw one.

94
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,050
Really didn't help.

95
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,450
The oscar prado case?

96
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,850
Yeah,fuckers are on the career-maker of the year.

97
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,650
They nail this freebo guy and they're golden.

98
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,490
The courts already let freebo go once

99
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,220
For those two girls in the everglades.

100
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,450
That was then.

101
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,590
This time,he killed a senior a.d.a.'s brother.

102
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,620
Afternoon fix.

103
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,990
Except he didn't kill oscar.

104
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,490
I did.

105
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,850
If it hadn't been for freebo,

106
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,020
Oscar would still be alive,

107
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,490
And I wouldn't be in this mess.

108
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,950
Besides,he's seen my face.

109
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,720
I've gotta find freebo before they do.

110
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,390
That's one thing I'm sure of,at least.

111
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,320
Nice watch.

112
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,350
Knockoff?

113
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,320
Me? no. real thing only.

114
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,650
I sold a kidney to get it.

115
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,050
I'll show you the scar sometime.

116
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,550
I'll give you a kidney not to.

117
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,420
Hey,dex,do me a favor.

118
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,390
Go over the prado blood evidence

119
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,050
One more time,okay?

120
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,090
Maybe you missed something.

121
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,450
Okay,but-- sergeant!

122
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,950
Yeah? we got narcotics on the line.

123
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,090
All right.

124
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,250
Hey,dex,wait up.

125
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,690
My jane doe.

126
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
See what you see.

127
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,090
Already saw what I saw,which was nothing.

128
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,890
So see what you see again.

129
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,350
I can't afford none solved,

130
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,150
Coroner says he found a pharmacy in her.

131
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,220
Big surprise,right?

132
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,350
Body dumped near the waterfront stroll.

133
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,690
Shocker.

134
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,220
Looks like every other tweaker hooker case.

135
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,350
Except the tattoo peeled off her shoulder.

136
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,250
Coroner says not a tattoo.

137
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,050
You're getting interested.

138
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,190
Actually,I'm getting sleepy.

139
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,550
It's reassuring to know I'm not the only one at sea.

140
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,450
I could throw them a line,

141
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,650
Tell them their cases are linked.

142
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,490
That jane doe is actually freebo's girlfriend.

143
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,950
That it was freebo who killed her.

144
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,450
But I need the head start.

145
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,890
Step away from the incense.

146
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,590
This is america,buddy.

147
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,850
Freedom of religion.

148
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,650
I didn't realize you were a buddhist,vince.

149
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,290
Japanese are traditionally shinto.

150
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,190
Really? oh,whatever.

151
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,990
I bought all this shit off my manicurist.

152
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,220
Need all the luck I can get.

153
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,790
Got a crucifix up there too.

154
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,520
'cause it did so much for jesus?

155
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,950
'cause forensics quarterly

156
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,450
Is deciding whether or not to publish my article.

157
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,620
You know,the one you read.

158
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,120
And proofed.

159
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,020
The incense stays.

160
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,250
Did he use you at the doctor's office?

161
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,350
But you've got to use me,maria.

162
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,220
A.d.a.s can put pressure on other agencies.

163
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,520
We have ramon,who's with the sheriff's department.

164
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,550
Together,we--

165
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,150
Miguel,miguel,tranquillo.

166
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,790
I know that you and ramon are going to help.

167
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,550
And it's hard to let somebody else

168
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,990
Handle oscar's case.

169
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,420
But I have my best detectives on this.

170
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,320
I got the best forensics team--

171
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,190
Morgan,right? he's part of it.

172
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,590
We are tracking down

173
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,790
Every one of freebo's known associates--

174
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,890
Looking under every rock.

175
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,390
We will find him.

176
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,020
This is a good team.

177
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,420
This is the same team,by the way,

178
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,850
That shared a roof with the bay harbor butcher.

179
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,290
That was totally out of line.

180
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,420
I'm--i'm sorry,maria.

181
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,250
It's just that my-- my fuse is so short

182
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,120
Ever since oscar.

183
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,920
Even with syl.

184
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,090
I'm driving her nuts.

185
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,490
I doubt that.

186
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,490
She knows what she's got.

187
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,290
The bay harbor butcher situation--

188
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,250
No,don't-- no,please.

189
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,250
I was too personally involved

190
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,250
To see it clearly.

191
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,790
And that's why I've distanced myself from things.

192
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,520
You should do the same with oscar.

193
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,790
I know.

194
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,190
I know. you're right.

195
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,820
Some things never change.

196
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,520
We're not as close as we used to be.

197
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,690
But at least I still have you as a colleague.

198
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,220
And I'm glad that it's you that's here.

199
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,620
Gracias.

200
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,550
Miguel prado's already seen too much of me.

201
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,090
I can't comfort the grieving.

202
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,090
You got this?

203
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,250
I got this.

204
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,550
Don't look familiar,hon.

205
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,650
Ooh,but those are some fine streaks.

206
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,350
Who did her hair?

207
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,720
Christophe of beverly fuckin' hills.

208
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,490
Yeah,do you have his number?

209
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,720
Petunia,

210
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,750
You are the dumbest whore on this stroll.

211
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,250
Sorry,sugar.

212
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,750
Don't got a name for you.

213
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,290
Keep walkin',girl.

214
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,750
It's all you're good for.

215
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,290
S'up,deb?

216
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,020
The she-males give you any leads?

217
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,920
It's officer morgan to you.

218
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,050
Right,not a detective yet.

219
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,690
Course,an unsolved isn't gonna get you any closer

220
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,150
To a shield.

221
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,390
Look,I don't know why i.a. picked me,but--

222
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,720
'cause detective quinn likes the ladies.

223
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,520
Well,then you don't need a snitch.

224
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,890
You need a fuckin' slut.

225
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,850
So why don't you go talk to petunia over there?

226
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,590
I can get you a shield tomorrow.

227
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,150
I'm a sergeant,after all.

228
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,750
You'd give me a shield for being a rat?

229
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,550
No,for being an honest cop,debra.

230
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,620
Like your father.

231
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,220
You are not god damn digging into my father right now.

232
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,290
Digging? please.

233
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,790
The old-timers at i.a. talk about him

234
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,290
Like he's a brother.

235
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,990
Well,the old-timers also talk about

236
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,950
How popular that made him.

237
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,050
Oh,god.

238
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,690
That really matters to you,doesn't it?

239
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,820
Your cop friends.

240
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,990
It's your whole life.

241
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,090
Them,the job,the shield.

242
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,690
Far as I can tell,without that,

243
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,950
You've got nothing.

244
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,850
Except your,uh,treadmill.

245
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,490
Kind of cunt,aren't you?

246
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,820
Nice.

247
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,950
But seriously,um,you should look into

248
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,820
Expanding your world a little.

249
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,250
You know,finding something else fulfilling.

250
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,550
Like...gardening or,um...

251
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,990
Ooh,scrapbooking.

252
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,850
Just in case.

253
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,950
Get me a name.

254
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,890
Teegan.

255
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,150
Drove a volkswagen rabbit.

256
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,390
That should buy me an address for her.

257
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,090
If I'm lucky,she left me a lead to freebo.

258
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,550
Tee...gun.

259
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,190
How many parents would give their kid a name like that?

260
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,590
Florida.

261
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,350
Nope. nope.

262
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,890
Bingo.

263
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,290
Teegan campbell.

264
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,720
Address on sorority row.

265
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,190
Guess I know what I'm doing tonight.

266
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,690
Teegan.

267
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,790
No,not a name I'd choose.

268
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,320
Megan. mary.

269
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,950
Those are classics.

270
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,620
Or,for a boy,charles...

271
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,590
Or philip.

272
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,090
Or richard.

273
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,820
Or what's so bad about...

274
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,050
Dexter,jr.?

275
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,350
Reminds me of you,dex.

276
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,990
Harry.

277
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,550
The last person I'd turn to for advice on fatherhood.

278
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,390
Old habits die hard.

279
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,150
Gotta focus on something easier to kill.

280
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,390
Freebo.

281
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,950
Dexter!

282
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,120
Shit.

283
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,750
Sorry,I'd rather go rifle through a dead girl's apartment.

284
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,420
Dexter.

285
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,520
I never really got to thank you for,uh,

286
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,990
Coming to oscar's wake.

287
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,120
It really means a lot to me and my family,

288
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,720
Knowing that you...

289
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,620
Are taking a personal interest in the case.

290
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,120
Okay. well,you're welcome.

291
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,990
Uh,what are you doing tonight?

292
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,050
Nothing.

293
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,550
Oh,well,then,you'll come for dinner.

294
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,120
I rarely take no for an answer.

295
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,350
You're gonna learn that about me.

296
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,890
I will.

297
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,350
Honestly,uh...

298
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,350
I wanna pick your brain about something.

299
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,090
And syl and i,uh,

300
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,520
You know,we could-- we could use the company.

301
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,650
The more people around,

302
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,320
The less we think about,you know.

303
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,420
Sure.

304
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,690
You married? you got kids?

305
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,820
No. no kids.

306
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,920
Uh,girlfriend.

307
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,920
Ah,bueno,bueno.

308
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,690
Bring her.

309
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,050
Unless you were lying.

310
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,890
You know,about doing nothing tonight.

311
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,450
We're gonna towel off,and we'll be right back.

312
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,890
Officer morgan,a music lover.

313
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,350
You ever seen this woman?

314
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,920
Quinn send you?

315
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,190
Different case.

316
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,220
My debt's to quinn.

317
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,950
Your debt's with the department.

318
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,150
I'm not an information atm.

319
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,020
I'm fucking desperate!

320
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,920
All right?

321
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,890
I got a steaming heap of crap all on this case.

322
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,090
I'm gone through every scum-sucking ball sack

323
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,150
Of a pimp I know,

324
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,190
Every whacked-out hooker.

325
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,620
You are my last-ditch ass-fucked effort!

326
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,720
God damn,you got a mouth on you,woman.

327
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,990
Great,thank you.

328
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,690
It's cool. show me the picture.

329
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,420
Not from the neighborhood.

330
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,650
But from the looks of her,

331
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,390
I doubt she had to pay cash for her habit.

332
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,190
A strawberry? right.

333
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,390
So I'm looking for a dealer who'll take payment in sex.

334
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,450
Yeah. that'll be about all of 'em.

335
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,690
Yeah.

336
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,990
Look,I can ask around for you,okay?

337
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,520
Thank you. I'd appreciate it.

338
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,590
But you should stay.

339
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,090
Grab a drink

340
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,920
And work some of that massive tension out

341
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,450
On the dance floor.

342
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,220
Well,you know what? it smells like armpits in here.

343
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,490
And I got a lot of work to do.

344
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,490
Well,you know,there is more to life than policing.

345
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,620
So I've heard!

346
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,250
If we had a house this big,

347
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,590
It would make sense to have another child.

348
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,150
It's a valuable lot.

349
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,820
Look at the lawn. it's so thick.

350
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,920
Be a great place for kids to play.

351
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,290
Zenith zoysia.

352
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,850
Thrives in warm weather.

353
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,850
I'm not talking about grass,dexter.

354
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,120
You're not?

355
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,290
I've been trying to talk about the pregnancy

356
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,650
The whole way here.

357
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,950
Maybe you should be a little less subtle in the future.

358
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,420
I'm trying not to pressure you.

359
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,690
But we have to make a decision

360
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,990
Before one's made for us.

361
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,690
You're right,I know. okay.

362
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,950
Welcome. I'm so glad you came.

363
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,950
Made it.

364
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,990
Hello. I'm rita.

365
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,620
Miguel. bienvenidos.

366
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,620
So you've met sylvia?

367
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,220
Syl,please.

368
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,850
So you guys have a beautiful home here.

369
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,790
Great place for kids.

370
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,190
Come on,I'll give you the tour.

371
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,250
Strong family resemblance.

372
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,990
My father.

373
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,350
He was a drunk and a bastard,

374
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,450
But he had a distinctive chin.

375
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,120
Some people just shouldn't have kids,you know?

376
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,490
Wish there were a test.

377
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,350
Oscar,he got the--

378
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,790
The best and the worst of dad.

379
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,550
Me,I just tried to stay clear,you know?

380
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,550
But,um...

381
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,350
I suppose he's in me too.

382
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,950
Hard to avoid.

383
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,690
Welcome.

384
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,520
I--i shouldn't drink.

385
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,620
What,are you pregnant?

386
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,350
You are.

387
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,750
Oh,my god,that's terrific.

388
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,150
Yeah.

389
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,390
Yeah.

390
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,320
Or not.

391
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,620
That sounded really bad.

392
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,050
I meant...

393
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,450
Miguel and I have actually been trying for a while now.

394
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,090
It even took once.

395
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,250
And miguel,he...

396
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,150
Wants to start a family before he makes his run

397
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,020
For the d.a.'s office.

398
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,490
But I don't know.

399
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,690
I'm happy with the way things are.

400
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,920
I don't wanna force dexter into something.

401
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,520
That's kind of what happened with the ex-husband.

402
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,690
Well,that and the fact that he was a sociopath.

403
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:40,690
I had an ulterior motive for inviting you here tonight.

404
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,350
Does it involve charging me with a felony?

405
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,450
No,the truth is,uh,

406
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,850
I wanted to talk to someone

407
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,790
Inside of this investigation.

408
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,350
See,'cause all I keep getting is reassurances,reassurances.

409
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,950
Reassurances make me nervous.

410
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,520
You want me to put you at unease?

411
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,120
I want you to be straight with me.

412
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,190
How certain are you

413
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,890
That this bastard freebo will be found?

414
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,590
Very.

415
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,320
So I'm gonna get my shot at him in court?

416
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,920
Well,that could take a while.

417
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,590
Huh? no,no,no. no more waiting.

418
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,250
I'm done waiting.

419
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,250
Is there another option?

420
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,620
I'm an a.d.a.

421
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,290
My brother ramon is a sheriff.

422
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,720
You don't think we got resources

423
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,120
If our lead pans out,

424
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,990
Then we'll talk to homicide.

425
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,450
You have a lead? that's great.

426
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,520
How can I help?

427
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,690
No,ramon,you know,

428
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,950
He has his own way of doing things.

429
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,990
I don't wanna drag you into it.

430
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,020
Come on.

431
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,350
You're talking to the guy

432
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,450
You caught breaking into your brother's secure files.

433
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,450
All right.

434
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,320
Ramon...may have...

435
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,750
Borrowed a cell phone...

436
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,520
That belonged to freebo's mother.

437
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:02,090
He calls mommy... we can track him.

438
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,120
Mother's cell phone. that's good thinking.

439
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,720
It may lead to nothing.

440
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,490
Or it may lead them to freebo

441
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,090
Before I can get to him.

442
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,290
I need to check out teegan's place

443
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,820
As soon as I can get out of here.

444
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,020
The hunt.

445
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,250
My vision is much sharper

446
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,820
Through the eyes of my shadow self.

447
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,950
If only I could see this baby situation as clearly.

448
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,590
I promised rita I'd be back in an hour.

449
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,550
So she's nesting while I'm hunting,

450
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,750
Stalking my prey.

451
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,590
I'll start with his prey-- teegan.

452
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,590
What she left behind will talk to me,

453
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,950
Guide me to him.

454
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,750
Or...

455
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,190
To a kegger.

456
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,020
What's the password?

457
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,320
There's a password?

458
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,320
I'm just looking for my girl teegan.

459
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,390
Where's her room again?

460
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,390
Ew,teegan?

461
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,150
Ew,that girl's a ho bag.

462
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,520
She's a ho! she's such a ho bag.

463
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,850
She doesn't live here anymore.

464
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,090
She's hoeing off campus,

465
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,050
Probably living in her ho pad.

466
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,150
How about you give me the address of her ho pad

467
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,020
So I can go tell her what a ho bag she is?

468
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,790
You have any party favors?

469
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,190
Oh,yeah. uh,sorry.

470
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,490
I don't have anything on me,but...

471
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,620
We put out.

472
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,850
We totally do.

473
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,620
All right,that is so totally off the hook.

474
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,420
But how about I just trade you for teegan's address?

475
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,820
Okay.

476
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,050
Okay.

477
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,420
22 lincoln log.

478
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,250
I suspect that's lincoln lane?

479
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,220
Whatever.

480
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,290
Let's get high.

481
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,220
You two wait here. I'll go get my stash.

482
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,320
Okay.

483
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,250
The leaders of tomorrow.

484
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,620
Their parents must be proud.

485
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,850
How much worse could my child turn out?

486
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,720
Do I even wanna know the answer to that question?

487
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,250
Teegan's ho pad will have to wait till tomorrow night.

488
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,650
I've got a girlfriend and a baby

489
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,420
Waiting on my promise to come back.

490
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,020
Is this what my life will be like--

491
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,490
Making promises I'm not sure I wanna keep?

492
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,050
It's complicated.

493
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,320
The pros and cons of responsibility.

494
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,420
All right.

495
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,650
Pros.

496
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,150
Can't we just talk?

497
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,990
Sometimes lists are easier for me.

498
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,920
give it!

499
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,350
It's my turn.

500
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,920
All right,pros.

501
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,890
Kids are cute.

502
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
Mom!

503
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,720
No soccer in the house!

504
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,020
cody!

505
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,990
I have to practice!

506
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,020
Cons?

507
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,020
Noise.

508
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,990
Time...money.

509
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,790
Stretch marks. saggy boobs.

510
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,890
Less personal freedom.

511
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,820
Personal...

512
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,590
Freedom.

513
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,820
All right,I thought I said no soccer in the house.

514
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,190
Now just go to your room

515
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,220
Until it's time for school.

516
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,490
Son of a...

517
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,390
What am I even thinking?

518
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,250
Zack adelman?

519
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,420
Yeah.

520
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,690
We need to talk to you about fred bowman.

521
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,750
Who?

522
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,850
Your pal,freebo.

523
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,390
The dealer you got busted with two years ago.

524
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,620
Oh,yeah. right,right.

525
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,050
Um,yeah,I haven't seen him in,like,uh,

526
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,190
Two years.

527
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,250
You mind if we come in,zack?

528
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,020
He actually doesn't have a choice,sergeant.

529
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,190
He's a parolee.

530
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,720
Oh,gosh,you're right.

531
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,350
Couldn't find anything new on your jane doe,sorry.

532
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,690
How's it going?

533
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,890
Backward.

534
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,420
I don't even think jane was a hooker.

535
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,320
Bummer. so who you looking for?

536
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,950
Her dealer.

537
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,050
What the fuck is scrapbooking?

538
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,690
The tradition of putting photos and memorabilia

539
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,690
Into family keepsake albums,along with relevant journaling.

540
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,450
I don't even want to know how you know that.

541
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,090
So do you know which dealer you're looking--

542
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,250
Morgan.

543
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,650
Yeah.

544
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,550
Got it. I'll meet you there.

545
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,990
Might have found some luck of my own.

546
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,990
The lead on jane's i.d.

547
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,250
As soon as it gets dark,I'm back on the hunt

548
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,490
So I can stay ahead of my sister.

549
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,820
This department is becoming annoyingly effective.

550
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,620
You home alone here,Zack?

551
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,920
Totally.

552
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,390
Get on your knees.  Put your hands on your head.

553
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,450
Don't move!

554
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,090
W-w-wait! it's just a cat,man.

555
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,820
It's cool,guys!

556
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,450
Shut the fuck up!

557
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,890
Hi.

558
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,420
Ah,this fuckin' paperwork's gonna take forever.

559
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,890
Come on,drop it.

560
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,150
Drop it! Come on.

561
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,450
Just a few pills,man.

562
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,650
What's the big deal?

563
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,920
The big deal is you're making me cancel

564
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,220
On a very willing woman.

565
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,120
Get on your knees next to your boyfriend.

566
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,390
Let's make a deal,then.

567
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,420
Let's trade,I--

568
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,320
Stop there,asshole.

569
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,590
We don't got time to process a bribery charge too.

570
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,990
I'm not offering you cash,man.

571
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,990
I've got valuable information.

572
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,390
On freebo?

573
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,720
Even better.

574
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,920
Chicky Hines.

575
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,190
Who the fuck is Chicky Hines?

576
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,250
Chicky hines just went down for a carjacking homicide.

577
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,650
He's waiting on sentencing now.

578
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,020
Yeah,this guy Zack says Hines didn't do the crime.

579
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,790
He's offering up an alibi for Hines

580
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,850
And another suspect.

581
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,620
I know all about the Chicky Hines case.

582
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,790
He was a big one for the prosecutor,

583
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,250
And guess who that was.

584
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,250
Shit.

585
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,750
Yeah, Miguel Prado.

586
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,090
So now,not only won't I be bringing him good news

587
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,450
About his brother's case.

588
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,320
Worse--i'm gonna undermine his latest conviction.

589
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:44,020
Think that's what he wants to hear right now?

590
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,190
Doubtful.

591
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,650
Christ,vet this. oh,yeah,vet this.

592
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,790
Completely.

593
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,390
I wanna be absolutely certain that this is solid

594
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,120
Before I even think about bringing it to miguel.

595
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,550
Hey,angel.

596
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,020
Case going all right?

597
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,690
No leads,no insights?

598
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,720
Just the pressure,bro.

599
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,020
Expected to make decisions,take responsibility.

600
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,690
You don't know what it's like.

601
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,390
Probably like finding out your girlfriend's pregnant.

602
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,020
Rita's pregnant?

603
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,920
Looks like it.

604
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,290
Holy shit.

605
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,090
That's fantastic.

606
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,350
It is?

607
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:36,550
My little girl is the best thing I ever did.

608
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,290
I've messed up a lot.

609
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,520
But in my darkest hours,

610
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,690
Auri's my light.

611
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
You wait and see.

612
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,590
Okay.

613
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,550
Thank you.

614
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,490
I feel better.

615
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,750
A light.

616
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,320
Is that even possible?

617
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,820
Higher,daddy!

618
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,750
Dexter,come play with us!

619
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,390
Come play with us,daddy.

620
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,520
I'm right behind you,buddy.

621
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:34,920
You're it,baby.

622
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,120
Cody and Astor would be older,you know.

623
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,420
I like them this age.

624
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:51,020
I always wanted to be a grandfather.

625
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,320
I think we're better off without you.

626
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,190
Well,it's a beautiful family you got there,Dex.

627
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,520
You couldn't picture this,could you?

628
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,890
I could have surprised you.

629
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:11,320
Yeah,there's no reason it couldn't turn out like this.

630
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,220
Astor!

631
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,320
Astor!

632
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,250
Astor!

633
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,690
What have you done?!

634
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,990
Yo,Morgan.

635
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,820
Where the hell have you been?

636
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,850
Street wasn't clear,yo.

637
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,290
I get spotted with you,no more trusty c.i.

638
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,790
Fine. what have you got?

639
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,320
All right,department six.

640
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,050
Pimp named Javier,completely new to the game.

641
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,490
But he already has a rep for his stable of white girls.

642
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,050
If your jane doe is a strawberry,

643
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,090
Chances are he tried to recruit her.

644
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,120
This is good. Thank you.

645
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,190
Yeah.

646
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,750
You get spotted with me,no more trusty c.i.

647
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,450
Yeah,but he likes 'em white.

648
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,650
Does he like 'em strapped?

649
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,220
All right,it's cool.

650
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,150
But I'll be here,anything goes sideways.

651
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,390
Miami metro. I'm looking for javier.

652
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,450
Entra,por favor.

653
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:48,020
You're a little young to be in business for yourself.

654
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,950
I'm a wonder kid.

655
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,390
Okay. Can you identify this woman?

656
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,820
You'd make a shitload more money on all fours

657
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,390
Than you do as a cop,mamita.

658
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,250
Oh,like I haven't heard that before.

659
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,390
Hey,look,little one,give me a name for this girl,

660
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:07,450
I won't bust you for being a piece of shit.

661
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,790
Never seen her. hmm.

662
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,950
Besides,she looks too used up to be an earner.

663
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,620
But you,damn,mami.

664
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,920
I could get you a thou a night.

665
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,720
Give you some spending money

666
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,820
For,uh,extra curricular activities.

667
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,950
Think I need to hear that?

668
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,720
You sleazy piece of shit!

669
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,920
I'm a cop! that's all I need!

670
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,850
I'm not gonna do any fucking scrapbooking!

671
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,150
-You got it?!  -Scrapbooking?

672
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,950
You fucked her.

673
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,620
You've seen her?

674
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,290
On his dick.

675
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,820
Hey,she's fading.

676
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,450
She doesn't even know what she's talking about.

677
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,650
Oh,I think she does,

678
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,850
And I think you fucked a girl who's now dead.

679
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:45,950
Fuck.

680
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,820
Look,I picked her up at some party.

681
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,990
All right?

682
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,350
I-i-i thought that I could turn her out.

683
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,350
What's her name?

684
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,950
I don't know!

685
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,250
Bitch,cunt,"hey,you."

686
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,320
Yeah?

687
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,950
This doesn't look good,javier.

688
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,220
All right,look,I passed her to a friend

689
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,750
-Who could feed her habit better than I could. a friend,right.

690
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,850
Yeah! yeah.

691
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,650
Yeah,a white guy named Freebo.

692
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,790
Freebo?

693
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,150
Yeah,yeah.

694
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,150
He could deal with her shit longer than I could.

695
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,290
Maybe he's a patient guy. I don't know.

696
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,890
Yeah,maybe not.

697
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,350
If my first stab at Freebo had gone as planned,

698
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,050
Oscar Prado might still be alive,

699
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,750
Miguel wouldn't know who I was,

700
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,950
Teegan would have lived to whole another day,

701
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,250
And Deb wouldn't be chasing a jane doe.

702
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,890
And I wouldn't be watching the clock,

703
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,190
Counting the minutes till darkness comes,

704
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,950
Trying to get the jump on my friends in blue.

705
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:34,950
Anything?

706
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,050
Uh,running additional DNA tests

707
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,190
On Oscar Prado's clothing.

708
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,950
If Freebo's cut himself,

709
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,190
His blood could be on these clothes.

710
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,190
Slam dunk in court.

711
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,490
Is there a chance?

712
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,720
Not even remotely.

713
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,950
Good.

714
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,890
Any idea what your sister found?

715
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,390
She found something?

716
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,720
I'm asking you.

717
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,250
She left a message saying she was vetting a big lead

718
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,320
That's gonna make me happy.

719
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,520
No idea.

720
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,450
Got the call. I'm getting published.

721
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,920
Hey. congratulations.

722
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,020
The shrine worked.

723
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,090
Totally.

724
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,290
Freebo just called his mother's cell phone.

725
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,420
I'll have his address by tonight.

726
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,420
And then you will let me deal with him.

727
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,150
Ramon,you've done your job.

728
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,890
I'm gonna take it from here,okay?

729
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,050
Go be with your family.

730
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,320
Don't fucking sideline me on this,miguel.

731
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,250
Hey,maria.

732
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,390
Hey.

733
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,090
Your assistant told me you were here.

734
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,550
What do you have on freebo,maria? ramon...

735
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,820
Well,we're working on some new angles.

736
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:42,850
Which means you've got shit.

737
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,120
Excuse us.

738
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,920
Go home.

739
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,720
'cause you're not helping here.

740
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,290
Ramon and his temper.

741
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,290
Yeah,I remember.

742
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,750
But...i get it.

743
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:06,090
I mean,him and oscar were close.

744
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,190
Miguel,I need to talk to you about something else.

745
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,190
Uh-oh. I remember that look.

746
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,290
Chicky hines.

747
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,450
Okay.

748
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,750
He didn't do that carjacking homicide.

749
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:29,820
We found new evidence,and it checks out,miguel.

750
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:32,290
I think you convicted the wrong man.

751
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,020
You're serious?

752
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,120
I was gonna wait,I mean...

753
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,820
The timing is...

754
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,090
Shit.

755
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,020
But if hines is innocent,miguel...

756
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,550
Miguel,I'm sorry.

757
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:56,320
Oh,this is frustrating and disappointing.

758
00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:00,650
And,uh...i really hate my job right now.

759
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,350
But,hey...

760
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,320
Don't ever think about holding back on me.

761
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:11,420
Okay? just like now,you tell me straight.

762
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:14,650
That's the maria that I've always counted on.

763
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,750
Always can.

764
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,220
When all of this is behind us,

765
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,520
I want to get together.

766
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,690
The three of us.

767
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,750
You know,as friends.

768
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,850
It's long overdue.

769
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,390
Night time.

770
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,790
Why you think freebo's still in town?

771
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,190
Because I think he killed his girlfriend on sunday.

772
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,790
Jane doe.

773
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,550
How do you know it's his girlfriend?

774
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,190
The c.i. gave me a lead.

775
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,250
I did some follow-up.

776
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,790
Whoa,whoa,whoa. my c.i.?

777
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,520
Do you have a name for jane yet?

778
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,720
No,but she was strangled,

779
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,090
With is consistent with freebo's m.o.

780
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,390
If you're right,

781
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,550
The oscar prado and jane doe cases are linked.

782
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,990
I guess we'll just have to merge them.

783
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,950
Freebo's still out there killing.

784
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,590
We've got to catch him fast.

785
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,720
But we got a lead now.

786
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,590
We find the girlfriend's i.d.,

787
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,450
We find her place,

788
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,750
Her friends,her family,

789
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:31,790
Then we find him.

790
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,120
I'll coordinate with the feds.

791
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,490
Ramos,reach out to street patrol.

792
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,050
Anton is my contact.

793
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,450
If you wear him out or blow his cover--

794
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,790
I know how to work a c.i.,quinn.

795
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,950
So unless there's some other reason

796
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,550
You don't want me to talk to him...

797
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:54,850
Solid police work,morgan.

798
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,790
That's how you earn your shield.

799
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,120
Thanks,sarge.

800
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,120
All right.

801
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,620
All right,people.

802
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,490
We're gonna be working late on this.

803
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,450
I'll be working late too.

804
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,690
Ho pad indeed.

805
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,090
All right,teegan,

806
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,720
Tell me where your homicidal beau might be.

807
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,450
Freebo.

808
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,650
Hiding out at his dead girlfriend's house?

809
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,020
Risky.

810
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,890
Then again,it took me a while to find this place,

811
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,850
And I knew who I was looking for.

812
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,650
No tools,no syringe,

813
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,350
No kill room,no sure thing.

814
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,650
Hang tight,freebo.

815
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,490
I'll be back before you know it.

816
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,650
Detached garage.

817
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,550
Perfect place for a kill room.

818
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,150
M-6 bayonet,vietnam-era.

819
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,750
A family keepsake,maybe?

820
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,850
Oscar tried to kill freebo with it.

821
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,250
It's only fitting I use it to complete the task.

822
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,490
Shit.

823
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:03,220
It's time for a decision,dexter.

824
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,350
Having this child

825
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,920
Is a huge mistake.

826
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,450
I've weighed out all the pros and cons,

827
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,220
And all I've got are cons.

828
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,920
I've been thinking the same thing.

829
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,120
I'm keeping it.

830
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,190
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.

831
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,320
But being a mother was never one of them.

832
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:37,420
Dexter,I'd rather do this with you.

833
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,690
But I've been a single parent for a long time now,

834
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,720
And I think astor and cody prove

835
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,120
That I'm pretty damn good at it.

836
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:47,490
Is this you being subtle again?

837
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:55,090
No,this is me in all sincerity

838
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,820
Saying I will honor your choice.

839
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:01,320
This child is happening.

840
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:05,690
But your role in its life is entirely up to you.

841
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,690
Should I take the out rita gave me?

842
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,350
What kind of father would I be?

843
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:18,750
After all,I kill people.

844
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,390
Long time,no see.

845
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:58,350
Oh,god.

846
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,290
What the hell is this?!

847
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,190
Show and tell.

848
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,120
It's been so long since you killed them,

849
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,420
I was afraid you'd... forgotten.

850
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:17,650
Oh,I'm sure teegan is fresh in your mind.

851
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:32,050
See,now,I didn't--

852
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,720
Aah! fuck!

853
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,350
You killed those girls in the everglades,

854
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:43,120
And you got away with it on a bad warrant.

855
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,890
I love those.

856
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,390
And then teegan came along.

857
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:11,920
First,you drained her of her self-respect and hope.

858
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,290
Then last sunday,you choked the life out of her.

859
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,590
No,last sunday...

860
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,950
I was gettin' high with--

861
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,820
It was cheri or...carrie.

862
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:25,950
She's at--she's at-- she's at alpha fee--

863
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,020
You seem uncertain.

864
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:37,620
It's uncomfortable,isn't it?

865
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,520
Just when you think you've answered all the questions,

866
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,720
Another one smacks you in the face.

867
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,890
Life,life,life.

868
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,420
Life is just like that.

869
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,520
Which is why I prefer death.

870
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,690
Dexter?

871
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:57,620
Is that you?

872
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,790
I had the phone records.

873
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,350
Well,what are--

874
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:13,350
Is he in there?

875
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,620
Alive?

876
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:39,550
It was self-defense.

877
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:49,190
I found a forensics lead.

878
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,390
It was a long shot.

879
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,690
I wanted to check it out before...

880
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,720
I wasted anyone's time.

881
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:59,720
I didn't expect freebo to be here.

882
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,590
He surprised me.

883
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,620
He jumped me...

884
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:04,750
With this knife.

885
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:06,050
That looks like my father's knife from--

886
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,190
From vietnam.

887
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,820
He gave that to oscar.

888
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,650
I didn't know what to do. I fought back.

889
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:28,990
The knife ended up in his neck.

890
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,320
I--

891
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,750
I'm gonna tell you something.

892
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:43,090
I wasn't sure that I could do this.

893
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,790
But you did.

894
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,220
You did.

895
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,020
We're gonna get rid of the evidence.

896
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:53,290
No. no!

897
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,690
You should leave--now. no!

898
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,750
Plausible deniability.

899
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,120
Thank you.

900
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,490
You're welcome.
