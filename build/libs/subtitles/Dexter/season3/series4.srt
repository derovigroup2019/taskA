1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,419
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:04,796
I'm pregnant.

3
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:07,840
I just think I'm gonna be a lousy
father. I don't wanna screw the kid up.

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,801
You're gonna be a great father.

5
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:10,968
The Oscar Prado case?

6
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:13,179
Freebo killed
the senior ADA's brother.

7
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,307
Except he didn't kill Oscar. I did.

8
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,519
Dexter, I don't know if you officially got
to meet my other brother, Ramon.

9
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,938
So you're the guy
that Miguel is always talking about?

10
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,064
Oh.

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,526
- What do you have on Freebo, Maria?
- We're working on some new angles.

12
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,361
- Which means you've got shit.
- Excuse us.

13
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:31,197
Freebo's still out there killing.
We gotta catch him fast.

14
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:34,200
Holy shit, that's my Jane Doe.
Teegan Campbell.

15
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,619
I was just telling Miguel
how we weren't giving up on Freebo.

16
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,330
Now I have to call him and tell him
that he's probably right.

17
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,833
Freebo's probably long gone,
and he didn't kill Teegan.

18
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:42,959
Looks that way.

19
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,878
Yuki Amado, Internal Affairs.
Do you know a Joey Quinn?

20
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,215
Be really cool if you could get next to him.
You know, do a little recon.

21
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,134
Yuki, that's not gonna happen.

22
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,720
If you light that, I'll arrest you.

23
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,305
I told you not to fucking do it!

24
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:59,016
Why the fuck did you lock up my CI?

25
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:02,019
Why do you keep calling him your CI?
Is there something you're not telling us?

26
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,147
What happened
with the witness I gave you?

27
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,774
I thought he had information
that exonerated Chicky Hines.

28
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,068
I reviewed his statement.
It just didn't add up.

29
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,822
Anton, I feel not good
about what happened.

30
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,949
I feel not good too.

31
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,077
This is the shirt I was wearing
when Freebo met his end.

32
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:22,623
That's his blood right there.
This shirt implicates me in his death.

33
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,126
I trust you, and I want you to trust me.

34
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,420
Is it possible
I've actually made a friend,

35
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,797
someone I can trust
with my dark secrets?

36
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,009
Or am I being foolish for even
asking myself these questions?

37
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,086
Role playing.

38
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,005
It's such an important part
of growing up.

39
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,549
When we were kids,
whatever role Deb assigned me -

40
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:40,261
evil monster, treacherous Nazi,
horrible alien -

41
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,306
I played them to perfection.

42
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,935
- We should tell them.
- About the baby?

43
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,313
I don't want them
to hear it from somebody else.

44
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,522
OK.

45
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,734
Um... Kids.

46
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,696
Dexter and I have something
we want to talk to you about.

47
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,406
- What?
- We're having a baby.

48
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,244
Um...

49
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,248
You're gonna have a new little brother
or little sister to play with.

50
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,043
- Which one?
- Which one would you like?

51
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,004
- A puppy.
- You can have a puppy and a baby.

52
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:21,928
- But you're not even married.
- No, no, we're not.

53
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:25,932
- Why not?
- I... never really thought about it.

54
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:29,685
You know, I'm gonna grab the potato salad
so I don't forget.

55
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,439
Family man.
Husband and father.

56
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,691
Sounds so upstanding.

57
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,485
Harmless.

58
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:42,448
Much better than
lives-alone-keeps-to-himself.

59
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:46,243
Should we?
I mean, it's not the worst idea in the world.

60
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,329
- Should we what?
- Get married.

61
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,456
Dex.

62
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,417
Yeah, cool. You'd be my dad.

63
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,799
Look, this is not something
we're gonna decide today.

64
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:04,095
Go get your stuff together.
We don't wanna be late for the Prados.

65
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,641
Dex.

66
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,143
That was ridiculous.

67
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,441
The only roles I had trouble
with were good guys -

68
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,819
heroes, knights in shining armor.

69
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,154
It just never felt right.

70
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,447
Not now.

71
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,658
Please, Miguel, listen to me.

72
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:29,745
- Someone matching his description...
- You can handle this, Ramon.

73
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,288
OK, let me help you.

74
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:35,042
Oh, no need.
Paper plates go right into the garbage.

75
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,628
- And we'll be back with dessert.
- Thank you.

76
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,881
I'm going.

77
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,550
Please, I really want you to stay.

78
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,718
Hey, easy.

79
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:47,346
I mean it, Dexter,
what were you thinking?

80
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,181
Proposing to me like that?

81
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,267
Oh. Sorry.

82
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,477
With the baby and all,
it just made sense.

83
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:57,481
People don't get married
because it makes sense.

84
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,901
They don't?

85
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:04,321
Would you have asked me
to marry you if I wasn't pregnant?

86
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,033
I don't know.

87
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,077
I married Paul
because I was pregnant.

88
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:14,457
And I won't marry again
unless it's because someone loves me.

89
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,420
I understand why you feel that way.

90
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:24,633
Being a father and being a husband
are two very different things.

91
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,302
You don't have to be both.

92
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:30,347
I don't want both unless it's real.

93
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,729
Real. How do you show someone
real love

94
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,523
when you don't even know
what it feels like?

95
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,693
Don't leave, Ramon.

96
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,447
It's just another empty lead,
another worthless tip.

97
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,158
I'm gonna keep chasing them
until I find the one that leads to my...

98
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,327
Our brother's killer, OK?

99
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,412
Stay, Ramon. Come on, for your family.

100
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,956
How 'bout I go for my family?

101
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,374
Ramon, no.

102
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,542
- I have to go.
- No.

103
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,211
- Sara.
- I got him.

104
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,838
Ramon. Come here.

105
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,717
Everything all right?

106
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,221
He's obsessed.
He's drinking more than usual.

107
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:15,726
He's not going to stop looking for Oscar's
killer until it takes him all the way down.

108
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,314
Grief hits some harder than others.

109
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,443
You know, we could help Ramon find peace
if we told him Oscar's killer was dead.

110
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,363
If we told him, then he'd know.

111
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:31,700
Ramon and I have shared and have kept
each other's secrets all of our lives.

112
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,745
- It's not just your secret.
- Which is why I'm asking you.

113
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,123
Miguel, he seems unstable.

114
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,791
- He's troubled.
- He has a temper.

115
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,795
- He's my brother. I can help him.
- You're it!

116
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,506
You're it!

117
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,509
He needs to know that Freebo's dead.

118
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,640
It's a big burden. Not everybody
can handle a secret like that.

119
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,439
You're uncomfortable enough
with me knowing.

120
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,943
Trusting my brother is just...
it's too much right now.

121
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,946
- I get it.
- Actually, you do.

122
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:13,284
Don't worry about it.
Ramon, he'll calm down eventually.

123
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,496
Not a chance. This won't go away.

124
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,041
Miguel can't see what
a loose cannon his brother is.

125
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,544
He might need some perspective.

126
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,005
Uncle Miguel, Astor won't let me
play in the cabin.

127
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:30,009
Don't worry, buddy.
I'll talk to her.

128
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,469
Astor, Carlos wants
to play in the cabin now.

129
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,514
- So?
- So sharing is one of the rules.

130
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,559
Whose rule?
You're not my father.

131
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,977
Astor!

132
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,396
Apologize to Dexter.

133
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,864
Think she's reacting
to my botched proposal?

134
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,491
She's so concerned about us
not being married.

135
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,620
I don't think it's just the marriage.
It's the new baby.

136
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,414
She's afraid she's
not gonna be special any more.

137
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,666
Wow, you're good.

138
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,543
I know my daughter.

139
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,547
She just needs some attention,
some reassurance.

140
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,341
Astor!

141
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,386
Astor is auditioning various roles -

142
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,723
wounded child, sullen pre-teen,
oppressed youth -

143
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,226
finding out who she wants to play.

144
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,436
Dramatic exit stage left.

145
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,231
I can't force my way into Rita's life

146
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:28,901
any more than I can force Miguel
to trust me over his own brother.

147
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,737
I need to take a cue from Astor,

148
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,906
get their attention.

149
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,242
But first things first.

150
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,953
I do have a day job.

151
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,428
That's what real love looks like.

152
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,266
Well, real love plus loss.

153
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:04,436
Is that what Rita needs to see in me?
Could be a problem.

154
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,563
That the fianc?©e?

155
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,940
Not anymore.

156
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,111
That's Fiona Kemp.
She came to meet the vic for a movie.

157
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,239
She saw the assailant.
He knocked her over as he fled.

158
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,532
That's how she got the bum knee.

159
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,827
Her description fits the one we've got
in a series of break-ins.

160
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,454
Same MO too,
back door crowbarred open.

161
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:26,125
We could barely get her to let go of him.

162
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,505
Deb, your butt's buzzing.

163
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,090
Christ.

164
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:41,015
- Quinn here yet?
- Yeah, I just saw him pull up.

165
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,229
Jesus, you should have
beat me here driving this thing.

166
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,898
I got stuck on the causeway
behind a stalled car.

167
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,401
I know you earn more with a shield,
but come on.

168
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,487
Got a great lease is all.
What do we got?

169
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,574
Jack Rice, 34. His head's caved in.

170
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,618
Looks like a B and E gone sideways.
A bunch of priors in the area.

171
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,163
- Witnesses?
- Just one.

172
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:09,001
Jack took the day off
to see a matinee with me.

173
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,378
A romantic comedy.

174
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,507
He calls them chick flicks
but he knows they make me happy, so...

175
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,926
I'm sure he was a great guy.

176
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,056
But the man you saw fleeing,
he was about six-foot, you said?

177
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,725
And I met Jack at the coffee place
where I work.

178
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:30,606
When he came in, something inside of me
just recognized him,

179
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,233
even though we'd never met.

180
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,028
- Have you ever felt that way before?
- Too many times.

181
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:40,324
We can look at some mug shots. Maybe
describe the man you saw to a sketch artist.

182
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,120
What?
I- I'm staying with Jack.

183
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,663
Jack has to go to the morgue.

184
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,917
Forensics is gonna need her clothes.

185
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,668
Well, why don't you tell her?

186
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,340
You can't take that.
It's his favorite cap.

187
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:01,595
- Ma'am, the cap needs to come with me.
- Mm-mm.

188
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,973
Sorry, Fiona.
We'll give it back to you when we're done.

189
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,266
You won't.

190
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,269
Hey, look at me.

191
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,355
Come on, right here.

192
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:16,402
I'm telling you that I, Joseph Quinn,
will personally make sure

193
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,071
that hat comes back to you unharmed.

194
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,411
- He's good.
- Who knew?

195
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,080
Is there anything else
you want to keep of Jack's?

196
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,249
Maybe one of his shirts?

197
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,043
Come on.

198
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,050
He's like the fucking witness whisperer.

199
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,430
Maybe he should propose
to Rita for me.

200
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,397
Astor, that's so unfair.

201
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,443
You're my little girl, and you
always will be. You know that, right?

202
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,823
- Rita, you in there?
- Yeah, just one second.

203
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,953
Astor, I asked you a question.

204
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,832
Look, whether Dexter and I
get married is between him and me.

205
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:17,379
You and I have to work on being kinder
with each other. Can you help me with that?

206
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,631
Please?

207
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,259
Rita, we need you out here.

208
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,971
Look, I've gotta get back to work.

209
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,474
We're gonna talk
about this tonight, OK?

210
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,100
All right.

211
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,192
We need to switch rooms.

212
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,653
We were expecting to watch the sun set
from our honeymoon suite,

213
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,656
because, obviously,
we're on our honeymoon,

214
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,116
but we couldn't see anything.

215
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,784
Right, uh...

216
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,829
Well, the sun sets in the west

217
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:55,083
and Miami is on the east coast of Florida,
so there's really nothing we can...

218
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,670
The brochure said,
"Watch the sun set over the ocean. "

219
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,005
Didn't it, honey?

220
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,508
It may have said "sun rise".

221
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:06,720
- We want your best room.
- The honeymoon suite is our best room.

222
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,848
There's always a better room.

223
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,352
Look, I'm sorry. Perhaps I can offer you
a complimentary breakfast?

224
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,355
I want a higher floor,
a better view, and better lighting.

225
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,066
It was way too dark in there
with the curtains closed.

226
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,653
- How about a one-hour spa treatment?
- I want a better room.

227
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,363
All right, we don't have a better room

228
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,032
unless you build one, and being a bitch
isn't gonna change that.

229
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,867
Rita.

230
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,828
Excuse me. I'll be right with you.

231
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,253
- We can't have this conversation again.
- I know. I'm sorry.

232
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:43,048
This is the second time this week. Plus,
you're always on a break or calling in sick.

233
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:46,218
I don't know what's going on
but, honestly, it's always something.

234
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,221
And now I have to comp
the honeymoon suite.

235
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:52,849
I'm really sorry, but I just can't afford
to employ you anymore.

236
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,396
Now, how can we make this right?

237
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,148
Some people
are ticking time bombs.

238
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:04,236
Ramon is one of them
and Miguel needs to see him explode.

239
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:08,699
The inciter, that's a role
I've always been good at.

240
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,035
Pick-up for Morgan.

241
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,873
Ramon. Hey, how you doing?

242
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,084
Dexter.

243
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,087
Oh, that's right.
Miguel said you two came here.

244
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,756
It's your secret spot, right?

245
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,009
Not anymore.

246
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,345
Oh, don't worry.
I'll keep it between the three of us.

247
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,557
Jefe, another rum and coke.

248
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,393
Oh, and could I get
some extra pickles?

249
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,942
Hey, sorry about the way
Astor treated little Carlos yesterday.

250
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,070
Oh, right, you left.
It was a minor turf war.

251
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,656
Don't worry, I watched out for him.

252
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,284
Carlos is a tough kid.
He can hold his own.

253
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,619
Yeah, I'm sure.

254
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,583
Sure you want to be drinking that?

255
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,919
If I wasn't sure, I wouldn't drink it.

256
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:06,757
It's just...
You know, Miguel's worried about you.

257
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,218
No offence, Dexter,

258
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:14,556
but if Miguel has a problem with me,
he will tell me himself.

259
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,559
Right. I mean, he said he did.

260
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,229
But, yeah, he will again if he needs to.

261
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:26,276
What goes on between me and my brother
is between me and my brother.

262
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,196
Absolutely.

263
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:34,660
I just happened to be there
when Miguel needed someone to talk to.

264
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,496
Since I've been through it too.

265
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,165
My mother was killed when I was a kid.

266
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,250
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,711
So I know how it feels.

268
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,672
Ha.

269
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,466
- But it gets easier.
- Hmm.

270
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:55,305
Like Miguel said, when he accepted his loss
and found closure, he moved on.

271
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,515
Hey!

272
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,560
Nobody is accepting anything. OK?

273
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:04,272
And when your homicide department gets
off its ass and starts doing its fucking job,

274
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:07,275
maybe then me and my brother
will move on.

275
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,737
Extra pickles.

276
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,198
Thanks.

277
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,412
I must have misinterpreted what he said.

278
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,205
Yeah.

279
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,790
You did.

280
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,877
Well, enjoy your dinner.

281
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,506
And tell Carlos I said howdy.

282
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,439
I knew I'd find you still here.

283
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,275
No rest for the wicked.

284
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,194
What brings you to these parts?

285
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,532
Uh, I wanted to ask you
about Chicky Hines.

286
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:56,825
Again?

287
00:17:56,951 --> 00:18:01,204
I got a witness who can provide
an alibi for Hines. It checks out.

288
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,666
- I told you I reviewed his statement.
- But you never talked to him.

289
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,460
Oh, come on, Maria.

290
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:11,089
Your witness is a habitual criminal
who's just trying to beat his latest drug rap.

291
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,718
Yeah, but that doesn't mean it isn't true.
And he can clear Hines.

292
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,345
Have you even met Chicky Hines?

293
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,432
I mean have... Have you read his jacket?
Because it's...

294
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,310
Hines didn't do this crime.

295
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,270
OK.

296
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,779
- What's this really about?
- An innocent man behind bars.

297
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,113
Maybe.

298
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,741
Maybe there's something else at play.

299
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,579
Accepting the truth about James Doakes,
that was hard for all of us.

300
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,333
Wow.

301
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,043
I wasn't expecting that.

302
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,170
I know.
Look, I shouldn't even mention it.

303
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,380
But, come on, he was your partner.

304
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,051
He's your friend.

305
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,429
Maybe you think he was railroaded,
I don't know.

306
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,141
And maybe that's coloring
how you're seeing Hines.

307
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,269
I'll admit it was hard.

308
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,606
But you know me, you know I'm a pro.

309
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,485
I also know you're human
like the rest of us.

310
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,825
?yeme, I'm just putting that
out there because we're friends.

311
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,584
The fianc?©e's working
with a sketch artist now.

312
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,838
So far it matches what the burglary division
already has on the break-ins,

313
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,173
so she's not giving us anything
we don't already have.

314
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,302
Yeah, except for more stories
about how perfect her dead fianc?© was.

315
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,180
Hey, it's not easy realizing
you're alone in the world.

316
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,727
What's the blood splatter telling you?

317
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,771
Just...

318
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,983
- Just clarifying some discrepancies.
- Well, clarify fast.

319
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,694
I'm gonna wrap this thing up,
get you two guys back on the Skinner case.

320
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,113
Yeah, you're preaching
to the choir, sir.

321
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,907
- Morgan, your ass is...
- Thank you. I fucking noticed it.

322
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,995
Ta-da! Comp tickets to my keynote address
at the forensics conference.

323
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,955
Not really my thing.

324
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:10,625
- I'm flea-combing my dog that night.
- I'm seeing my little girl that night.

325
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,545
You don't even know the date.

326
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,214
I- I gotta keep my schedule open for her.

327
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,053
Et tu, Dex-tay?

328
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,097
Wouldn't miss it.

329
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:32,981
Masuka.
He's chosen the role of court jester.

330
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,650
Now we only like him
when he's making us laugh.

331
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,528
Still, there's something to be said
for being a character actor.

332
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:43,283
The lead players with all those emotions
must be exhausting.

333
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,918
Looks like the sketch that burglary already
has on the break-in suspect.

334
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:57,047
- You couldn't get any more out of her?
- Officer Morgan, the woman's a wreck.

335
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:05,263
So... he didn't have
any distinguishing marks,

336
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,182
any scars or tattoos?

337
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,100
Uh, maybe.

338
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,519
Um, I don't remember.

339
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,146
He ran right by you.

340
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,066
I was... I was surprised.

341
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,734
Let's take a deep breath.

342
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:22,447
Close your eyes.
Try to picture it again.

343
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,618
It's so horrible.

344
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,914
My Jack just lying there.
Why is this happening?

345
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,250
- OK, let's not picture it any more.
- Jack's never coming back.

346
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,795
Let's focus on something else
right now, OK?

347
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,838
We'll just focus on something else.

348
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,799
- Fiona.
- Hi.

349
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,011
- How are you holding up?
- I'm not helping at all.

350
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,889
Are you kidding?
You're doing great.

351
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,432
You're a champ.

352
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,351
I'm trying, but...

353
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:57,816
Why don't we take a break from all this
and go look at some pictures together, OK?

354
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,776
OK.

355
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,987
We'll be in Interview Three
with the mug books.

356
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,488
I'll set it up.

357
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,615
That's OK, I got it.

358
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,762
They say this part should pass soon.

359
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,350
They say I should glow.
Am I glowing?

360
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,479
You are to me.

361
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,112
I can't believe I called a guest a bitch.

362
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,989
Sounded like an accurate description.

363
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:50,368
I think I'm gonna talk to my boss
and ask for my job back.

364
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,413
Really? I always got the impression
you didn't particularly like that job.

365
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,081
It's a job.

366
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,501
No one's gonna hire me
knowing I have to go on maternity leave.

367
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,379
Plus I barely have any savings.

368
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,881
I'm pregnant.

369
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,174
No health insurance.

370
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,010
My insurance would cover you.

371
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:10,764
Rita, if we got married, we'd have
joint assets. You wouldn't have to worry.

372
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,477
Let's not forget about marital deductions.
With Astor and Cody as dependants...

373
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,152
- No, huh?
- Uh-uh.

374
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,913
That's one ugly guitar.

375
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,082
Ugly? Pssh.

376
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:41,086
A beat-up guitar like this speaks
to the experience of its owner.

377
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:43,254
The many hard roads
we've traveled together.

378
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,256
So you've had it a long time.

379
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:49,552
No, a couple of weeks.
Picked it up at a pawn shop for 20 bucks.

380
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,471
Gives me a certain mystique, doesn't it?

381
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,848
You are full of shit.

382
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,601
So what do you need, Officer?

383
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:00,396
A stiff drink after a shit day.

384
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,191
- And you came here?
- For the margaritas, trust me.

385
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,568
One margarita.

386
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,615
How well do you know Quinn?

387
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,742
He have something to do
with your day being shit?

388
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,452
Maybe.

389
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,496
I've heard stuff about him.

390
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,249
And he comes off really slick,
and then he turns around

391
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:22,293
and he's all sensitive
and caring about people.

392
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,171
What's his story,
is he a good guy or a bad guy?

393
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,923
Does it have to be either/or?

394
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:31,261
In my world? Yeah. But I can't figure out
which one he decided on.

395
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:35,306
All I know is, um,

396
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,600
Quinn helped me out of a jam
when I was in trouble.

397
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,814
The man gave me an opportunity,
and I took it.

398
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,442
OK.

399
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:51,656
Besides, without Quinn,
you would have no CI,

400
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,408
and I'd be drinking alone.

401
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:59,164
I doubt that.

402
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,856
Oh, you're a hungry man.

403
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,816
And you're a beautiful meal.

404
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,236
You, uh, you looking
for anything special tonight?

405
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,572
Your eyes.

406
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:33,907
They're soulful.

407
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,950
Well, the compliments are free,

408
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:40,330
but an hour of my time costs.

409
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,583
It might be more than an hour.

410
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,214
Take a pass, Sergeant.

411
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:55,887
Tonight, for a couple of hours anyway,
I'm not a...

412
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,267
Tonight, all night, I am.

413
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,190
Shit, this is a sting.

414
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,110
Just shut up and go with this.

415
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:15,281
You goddamn deadbeat! You come up
to my room, and you ain't got no cash!

416
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,618
Well, nobody sees Jazmin
that ain't got no cash.

417
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,454
You wasted my time, you motherfucker.

418
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:28,002
Wow, so she threw up?

419
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:31,130
Yep. Her answer apparently.

420
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:35,009
Not really the response you want to hear
to a marriage proposal.

421
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:39,138
Yeah, hence my call to you
and the bribe of a beer.

422
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,975
You've obviously had
one successful proposal.

423
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,977
Tell me your secret, o wise one.

424
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,187
OK.

425
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,482
Well, whatever you do,
don't suggest eloping

426
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,443
because a wedding conflicts
with a big case you've got coming up.

427
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:56,281
- You did that?
- It went over about as well as yours did.

428
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,283
I'm not the only hopeless one.

429
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:02,870
You and me, buddy,
making the women of America sick.

430
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:08,209
I did eventually figure out that women
tend to lead with their hearts.

431
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,253
So you might try leading with yours.

432
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:14,257
- Is that the only option?
- Only one that works, hermano.

433
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,304
Oh, speaking of hermanos,
I ran into Ramon last night.

434
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,430
I heard.

435
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,349
- Actually, I got an earful.
- Sorry.

436
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:27,103
I tried to reach out to him, make
a connection. I think I just upset him more.

437
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,315
It's OK. It led to a really good talk.

438
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,901
Talk?

439
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:35,862
Co?±o. I didn't tell him, Dexter.

440
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,364
I keep my promises.

441
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,868
But when and if you ever
feel comfortable telling him,

442
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,038
I'm just saying
I think Ramon is ready.

443
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:54,172
Miguel keeps trying to cast Ramon
in the role of misunderstood good guy.

444
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:58,384
Personally, I think he makes a much better
bad guy. I just have to convince Miguel.

445
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,804
A doughnut
and a ticket to hear me speak?

446
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,806
I'll take a doughnut.

447
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,603
You already got a ticket.

448
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,521
You're bribing people to come
to your keynote address?

449
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,733
The whole doughnut thing
works for you, doesn't it?

450
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,276
The blind leading the blind.

451
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,403
Doughnut and a ticket?

452
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,909
Just fucking take one.

453
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,869
Hey.

454
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,538
Hey. Something up, Lew?

455
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,375
You remember that statement you took
from the Chicky Hines alibi?

456
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,668
You want me to recite it by heart?

457
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,129
So you buy it?

458
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,257
Even though the alibi comes from somebody
trying to beat a drug rap?

459
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,134
It's solid.

460
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,305
- Is the ADA still sitting on it?
- Mm-hm.

461
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,683
Well, then you did all you could.

462
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,062
Maybe.

463
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:58,319
Hell musta froze over
cause cops won't eat donuts any more.

464
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,531
- Maybe the price is a little too high.
- Oh, please.

465
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,867
Why wouldn't they want to support
a colleague during his shining moment?

466
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,245
You want an honest answer to that?

467
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,955
It was rhetorical.

468
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,250
All right.

469
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,001
All right, tell me.

470
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,589
You're, like, the foulest person
I've ever met.

471
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:22,218
Every line out of your mouth
is a sick joke.

472
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:23,511
I'm funny.

473
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,471
Yeah, you can be.

474
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:30,351
You can also be completely revolting
and sometimes that's all people see.

475
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,938
What do you know?
You're the fucking new guy.

476
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:37,316
Hey, Dr. Phil, your girlfriend's coming in
again to look at more mug books, so...

477
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:43,739
Hi there, Deb. Help yourself.
I saved you one with the cream filling.

478
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,451
Ugh, freak.

479
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,791
Sergeant Batista.

480
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,670
It's you.

481
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,006
With clothes.
I mean, different clothes...

482
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,092
Yeah, I'm Detective Barbara Gianna,
Metro Vice.

483
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,552
Can we talk?

484
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,431
Yeah.

485
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:14,228
Look, this department has had

486
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,231
a lot of shit dumped on it
with the Bay Harbor Butcher.

487
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:22,987
And now you, a sergeant, are looking to
make the news getting busted with hookers.

488
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:26,491
Now, I turn you in now,
I save this department worse later.

489
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:29,076
Cause guys like you never learn.

490
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:30,995
Hey, look,
maybe I'm an asshole, but...

491
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,872
Do not...

492
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,541
insult me by saying
this is your first time.

493
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,754
OK, cause I hear this same horseshit
sob story from every john I bust.

494
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,799
Does any part of you think that any part of
me is proud of what I've done?

495
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,345
No part of me really cares.

496
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,972
It's just that...

497
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,476
I destroyed my marriage.

498
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,438
I lost my little girl.

499
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,528
I'm a divorced cop

500
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:05,988
halfway down the road
to a full-blown clich?© -

501
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:10,785
a divorced, alcoholic cop.

502
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,830
And I needed to fight that...

503
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,002
loneliness.

504
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:25,758
So I found affection any way I could.

505
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,468
I mean, hookers?

506
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:31,556
I needed to connect with someone,
anyone,

507
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,724
who wouldn't hurt me back no more.

508
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,565
That's it.

509
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,858
Not special.

510
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,320
Just true.

511
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,660
I hate anyone who disgraces the badge.

512
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:55,288
I hate liars worse.

513
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,331
I'm not lying.

514
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,210
I know.

515
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,337
Are we good?

516
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:08,384
You keep your dick in your pants
unless you're, A, playing with yourself

517
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:12,096
or, B, you are doing
something consensual and legal.

518
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,434
Then we're good.

519
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:27,445
Ramon, what are you...

520
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,822
Any progress on finding
Oscar's killer?

521
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,617
We're liaising with the Feds
in case he went over the border.

522
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,952
But what if he's right here
in our own backyard?

523
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,079
It's an ongoing concern, Ramon.

524
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,040
But not a priority, right?

525
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,292
- Hey. Is there a problem here?
- Lower your voice.

526
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:44,462
Yeah, Sergeant, your people don't know
what the fuck they're doing.

527
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,381
Hey, that credit you get for being a cop,
it has a limit.

528
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,966
So you do have a game plan.

529
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,260
Cause it doesn't seem
to involve listening to solid leads.

530
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,638
Every lead has been followed.

531
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:57,808
Then why am I getting calls from a guy
who says he saw Freebo in Miami?

532
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,187
I'll tell you why, because you ignored him.
He called you four times.

533
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,271
- Never happened.
- OK.

534
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,648
OK. Est??bien.

535
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:07,360
Ramon, you give me this tipster's name,
I will personally follow through.

536
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,819
The motherfucker was anonymous.

537
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:12,114
Oh, did I forget to leave my name? Sorry.

538
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,910
But he knew things about this case.
Like Freebo had a girlfriend, Teegan.

539
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:19,163
A lot of people know that, sir.
I passed her photo all over town.

540
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,332
Maybe the tipster wanted reward money.

541
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,502
You can find excuses
or you can get off your asses

542
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,003
and try finding my brother's killer.

543
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,131
OK, Ramon, you need to leave now!

544
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:41,143
Just do your fucking job.

545
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,239
You wanna give his brother
the heads-up?

546
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:57,535
You do it. I'm a little tired
of the Prado family right now.

547
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,417
That was easier than I thought.

548
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,049
Miguel won't be happy to hear
Ramon's throwing tantrums

549
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,844
with fellow law enforcement.

550
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,054
Not that I'll rely on that alone.

551
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,558
The stakes are too high
and I'm on a roll.

552
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,521
Maybe I should call Rita
with an anonymous tip to marry me.

553
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,900
Oh, what the fuck, Dex?

554
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,737
Good, you're here.
Put this on.

555
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:35,781
I don't need a giant condom.
I need your spatter report on Jack Rice.

556
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:40,745
I'm working on it. Just put on the suit
and the gloves and the mask, please.

557
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,413
Fine.

558
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,500
The sooner I'm done with the
weeping fianc?©e, the better off I'll be.

559
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,087
Raw emotion.
Not your forte, huh?

560
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:54,091
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- Hey, it's not mine either.

561
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,635
It's easy as hell for Quinn.

562
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,430
Think he's just nicer than me?

563
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,849
I don't know about nicer.

564
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:05,060
Although studies show
that emotional intelligence

565
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:08,355
plays a greater role
in individual success

566
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:11,400
than anything that can be measured
on a standard IQ test.

567
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,819
Come here.

568
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,989
Stand right here
and bash this for me, will ya?

569
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,617
Are you calling me an emotional idiot?

570
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,410
If you're an idiot, I'm a vegetable.

571
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,579
Well, that's for fucking sure.

572
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,375
Fuckin'- A, Dex!

573
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,212
Sorry.

574
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,301
You know what,
Fiona has her facts wrong.

575
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:41,305
She described the assailant as six-foot.

576
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:45,226
But calculating Jack Rice's height,
allowing for the upward angle...

577
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:48,437
- Layman here.
- Well, your body acts as a shield.

578
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:52,107
And all of this is what
your body doesn't block.

579
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,529
So the killer stuns the victim
with the first blow. He falls to his knees.

580
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,698
The second blow brings us blood.

581
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,742
If the killer was six-foot,

582
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,996
the spatter shadow at the crime scene
would be taller and wider.

583
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:09,750
Instead, it's an exact match
for your shadow.

584
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,878
Ergo, Rice's killer was approximately
your height and weight.

585
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,589
You mean fucking weep-bag
Fiona's height and weight?

586
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,509
No, I mean...

587
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,930
I missed that. Interesting.

588
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:40,281
- You and Jack planning a big wedding?
- Yeah.

589
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,408
Jack had a lot of friends, yeah.

590
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:46,370
You know, the thing is,
I went through his address book

591
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:49,456
and I called a lot of people,

592
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,877
and none of them
have ever heard of you.

593
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:55,504
Well, we like to keep
to ourselves, you know?

594
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,678
When was that taken?

595
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,266
It was right after we met.

596
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,477
Did he get a chance to see it
before you killed him?

597
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:13,856
What?

598
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:18,527
Uh, what-what is she talking about?
I don't...

599
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,906
It's Photoshopped, Fiona.

600
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:23,949
It's really good work, though.

601
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,201
Really good.
Did you do it yourself?

602
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:27,912
God, no.

603
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:31,081
See, I'm thinking maybe you broke into
his apartment to leave that as a surprise.

604
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,709
He comes home, tries to throw
your ass out, and you kill him.

605
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,712
No, I would never hurt Jack.
We were getting married.

606
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:41,091
You heard about the break-in on TV,
you create the same sketch that was on TV,

607
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,551
the same crowbar in the back door.

608
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,387
You bash your own fucking knee in!
Did he ever even talk to you, Fiona?

609
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:49,224
Did he ever even say more than
"one fucking coffee to go"?!

610
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:53,020
That's it. This is over.

611
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:58,400
I'm sorry.

612
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,695
Wait outside, Officer.
I'll take it from here.

613
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:16,919
- It's all right.
- Mm-mm.

614
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:22,758
I know how it really was
between you and Jack.

615
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,885
I know.

616
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,304
You all right?

617
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,014
Yeah.

618
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,141
It's safe. It's just me and you.

619
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,855
Can you believe this shit?

620
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,983
It's amazing.
She's so convincing.

621
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:42,611
I'm talking about him.
I'm gonna kick his Cadillac-driving ass.

622
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,156
Before Jack,

623
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,617
my life was
an unanswered question.

624
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:50,869
Unanswered question.

625
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,998
Days and nights
spent looking for something.

626
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:56,917
Quinn played me
like a fucking $20 guitar.

627
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,252
Shh.

628
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:04,591
The first time
he came into the caf?©, I... I felt him.

629
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,848
We were connected, you know?

630
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,770
Everywhere I went, he was with me.

631
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,148
Jack made me real.

632
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:23,235
Made me real. She believes it...
Down to her core.

633
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,528
It's not an act.

634
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:28,032
The only actor in that room is Quinn.

635
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,544
If Fiona can be this convincing
about someone she didn't even know,

636
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,005
I should be able to convince Rita...

637
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,090
and others.

638
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,469
Ellen.

639
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:49,803
Hello?

640
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,347
Ellen?

641
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,067
Mmm.

642
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:07,071
Thank Christ you found the place.
I couldn't have waited much longer.

643
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,572
A client just sent me these.

644
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:12,910
Without a responsible adult to share them
with or shame me, I would eat them all.

645
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,119
I would.

646
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,914
- Try that one.
- Mm-mm.

647
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,708
Seriously, ganache frosting.

648
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,670
Oh, what the hell?

649
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:29,301
So... I'm guessing you wanted
to meet for reasons

650
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,846
other than working up
a case of type 2 diabetes.

651
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,182
The Chicky Hines conviction.

652
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,186
Yeah.

653
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,773
Not the justice system's finest hour.

654
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:46,485
My people have come across evidence
that could get the case reopened.

655
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,614
I like the sound of the quid.
What's the pro quo?

656
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,032
Nada.

657
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:58,789
Witness statement giving Hines an alibi,
another suspect. All of which checks out.

658
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,920
Ohh.

659
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,221
Two-plus decades doing this job

660
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:18,392
and a cop's never once handed me
a get-out-of-jail card.

661
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:24,523
Especially when that cop's got a history
with the ADA who put my guy away.

662
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,195
This isn't about Miguel Prado.
It's about doing what's right.

663
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,866
Well, I'll take "yes" for an answer then.

664
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,163
Prado know you're coming to me
with this?

665
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,956
No.

666
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,499
Guess he'll find out.

667
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,422
Well, you better be wearing old clothes,

668
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:51,466
because the shit is gonna be flying
in your direction.

669
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,635
Hmm.

670
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,764
- Hmm?
- Whoa.

671
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:59,349
Cupcakes and Scotch.

672
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,894
Yes.

673
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:04,771
Come on.

674
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,150
Two fingers.

675
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,985
Ah.

676
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,071
Yeah, I'm tellin' you,
I saw Freebo again.

677
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:13,238
Yeah, I'm tellin' you,
I saw Freebo again.

678
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,824
No, man, I'm not comin' in.

679
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,869
Fine, I'll meet you.
You got a favorite bar?

680
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:22,915
Yeah, I know it. Order me a rum and Coke.
I'll be there in ten.

681
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,126
You can lead a horse to water,
but you can't make him drink.

682
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,671
Unless you order his favorite
and keep him waiting.

683
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,965
And waiting.

684
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,888
Hey.

685
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,723
So the nut job went.

686
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:43,727
She said she caved his head in
to preserve their love.

687
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,104
Good work.
How about I buy you a drink?

688
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,399
How about you kiss my ass?

689
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,986
Next time you're playing good cop/bad cop,
you fucking let me know I'm playing too.

690
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:56,740
- I'm sorry about that.
- When'd you figure out she did it?

691
00:42:56,866 --> 00:43:00,702
I had a hunch from the beginning.
But I wasn't sure until you were.

692
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,830
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Cause you'd have blown it.

693
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,749
So fuck you.

694
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:10,379
Morgan, you got one tool in your toolbox
and that's a hammer.

695
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:14,049
You can't help yourself.
So I played off it, and it worked.

696
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,221
You just don't have a poker face yet.

697
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,014
Maybe yours is a little too good.

698
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,776
Don't you have a life?

699
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:35,112
Not lately.

700
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:36,405
Whew.

701
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,116
I needed to talk to you about Ramon.

702
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:42,077
Yeah, I heard he made a scene. Sorry.

703
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,663
Actually, it was an eye-opener.

704
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,044
Made me realize you were right.

705
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,715
- About?
- Telling him...

706
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,050
About Freebo.

707
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,432
He's putting his career at risk.
And it could hurt your reputation.

708
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,142
I'm not gonna be responsible for that.

709
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,811
Don't worry.
Ramon will always put family first.

710
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,105
We worked too hard
to get to where we are.

711
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:13,275
- He would never jeopardize that.
- And we can trust him?

712
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,612
He's in a lot of pain.

713
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:22,868
Which we can end. Tonight.

714
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:26,830
- Dex...
- Please.

715
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:28,999
Just call him.

716
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:38,175
Hey, Ramon, what are you up to?

717
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:41,595
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

718
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:47,684
Why don't you just get the bartender
to call you a taxi, or I'll...

719
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,478
Nah, fuck you, Miguel.

720
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,481
The motherfucking bartender
won't even give me...

721
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,817
Fuck.

722
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,082
Having a big night, huh?

723
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:15,045
What I'm having is another drink,
but this prick is trying to cut me off.

724
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,672
- Oh, and you're here.
- Boys' night out.

725
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:19,841
So why don't we just
all go back to my place?

726
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,886
- We can have Syl make a little...
- I'm not going to your place.

727
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,222
I'm not gonna let Sara
and the kids see you like this.

728
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:27,391
Like you're some kind
of example in this family?

729
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:30,102
Turning your back on Oscarito!

730
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:34,231
Oye, this is not the place.
Now, you know that.

731
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:36,066
Tell me something.

732
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:39,861
Why are you running your mouth about
family business to a goddamn stranger?

733
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:43,448
Dexter is not the problem here, Ramon.
Now, come on, please.

734
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:47,953
The two of you coming in here like some
fucking kind of Batman and Robin.

735
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,079
Whoa.

736
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:51,581
Keep your fucking hands
off of me, pendejo.

737
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,542
I'm sorry, Dexter. I got this.

738
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:54,793
You sure?

739
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,420
He said fuck off.

740
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,132
I'm gonna get another drink.

741
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:03,718
Hey, that guy over there, the drunk one,
he just put his hand on that girl.

742
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:06,638
She's pretty upset,
and I think I saw a gun.

743
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:24,322
I take no pleasure
in manipulating Miguel this way.

744
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:28,160
Still, I think he'd prefer it
to my usual alternative.

745
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:34,749
Hey.

746
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:37,419
You didn't return my last text.

747
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,592
Well, I guess I ran out of ways to say
I won't be your fuckin' rat.

748
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,845
Heard you and Quinn
had a tricky case.

749
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,847
I just filed the report.

750
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,724
Yeah, I just read it.

751
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:55,520
According to the report, Quinn
cracked the case mostly on his own,

752
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,856
and I'm wondering why someone
hoping to get her shield

753
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,816
would let him write it up that way.

754
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,946
I wrote the goddamn report.
Not him.

755
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,948
He got the confession, so it's his win.

756
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,409
Unless he used you.

757
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,037
You see, he's good at that.

758
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:16,666
You partner with him, you trust him, then
sooner or later, you're questioning yourself.

759
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:20,712
I mean, he's such a great guy.
It can't be him.

760
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:26,259
Except the only question he's asking
is how everything can benefit him.

761
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,542
Hey, breakfast.

762
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:01,002
Thanks for coming.

763
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:11,555
We used to play on this beach right here.
Me, Ramon, Oscar.

764
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:13,598
Sounds fun.

765
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,892
Ah, we had each other.

766
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,435
Always have.

767
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:23,066
No matter what kind
of horrible shit you would pull,

768
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:28,071
they knew you inside-out,
the good and the bad.

769
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:32,450
And they were there for you,
no matter what.

770
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,080
I never had that.

771
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,585
Maybe you're lucky
you don't have it to lose.

772
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:47,257
You won't be left with a gaping hole.

773
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:52,220
No, there are still holes.
I just find other ways to fill them.

774
00:48:55,975 --> 00:49:00,812
I lost Oscar to drugs
long before he was killed.

775
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,522
And now I'm losing Ramon.

776
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,733
I can't fool myself.

777
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:08,945
He can't be trusted.

778
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,532
It's like...

779
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,160
Co?±o...

780
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,454
I only have one person
I can trust any more.

781
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,333
Yourself.

782
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:24,294
I was thinking of you.

783
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,675
- Oh.
- Oh, don't worry.

784
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,303
I know that trust
doesn't come too easy to you.

785
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:38,099
- Is it that obvious?
- Well, to me.

786
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:43,647
I can just see that you're used
to carrying your secrets to yourself.

787
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:52,364
- Tends to be safer that way.
- But it's a hell of a burden, man.

788
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,825
See, I'm used to having a brother.

789
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:59,245
Share the load.

790
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:10,465
I'm hoping maybe
you'll get used to it too.

791
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,137
To be a brother.

792
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,308
To have a friend.

793
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,106
To have a wife, a family.

794
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:35,281
Fiona wanted it so bad
she invented it,

795
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:38,034
played all the parts herself.

796
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:45,417
But if you play a role long enough,
really commit,

797
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,044
does it ever become real?

798
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:55,635
Could I become real?

799
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,434
Hi, Dexter.

800
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,394
Dexter?

801
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,479
This is a surprise. You didn't call.

802
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,067
Is everything all right?

803
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,533
Dexter, what is it?

804
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:24,164
My life has always felt like...

805
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:25,749
an unanswered question.

806
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:32,964
A string of days and nights,
waiting for something to happen, but...

807
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,382
I didn't know what.

808
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,302
Why is he acting so weird?

809
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,637
I don't know.

810
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,852
Rita, we're connected.

811
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:48,813
Wherever I am...

812
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:52,150
I feel you...

813
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,612
and the kids...

814
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:58,114
With me.

815
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:00,992
You're what makes me real.

816
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,498
I want us to...

817
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:08,666
always go out for banana splits.

818
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:13,546
And replant the lemon tree
that keeps dying.

819
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,257
And I never, ever
want to miss a pizza night.

820
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:22,806
And that's how I know
I want to marry you.

821
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:26,226
Because something as simple
as pizza night is the highlight of my week.

822
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,271
But not without the kids.

823
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,567
Cody, Astor,

824
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,861
you guys are my family.

825
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,491
I'm gonna hang on to you for dear life.

826
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,038
Please, say yes.

827
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,255
Yes!

828
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:56,673
Yes, we will marry you.

829
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:10,520
Most actors toil in obscurity,
never stepping into the spotlight.

830
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:12,355
But if you hone your craft,

831
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,065
work diligently,

832
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:19,362
you might just find yourself
cast in the role of a lifetime.
