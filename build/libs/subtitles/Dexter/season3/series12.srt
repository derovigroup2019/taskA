1
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:41,567
Previously on dexter...

2
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:43,751
I can honestly say

3
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:45,201
I know who miguel prado really is.

4
00:01:45,234 --> 00:01:46,767
My first good friend.

5
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,401
We need to go after the root cause.

6
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:52,534
Blood-Sucking   soulless defense attorney ellen wolf!

7
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:53,833
Walk in the park to discredit you   counselor.

8
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:55,201
Try it. Oh   i'm not the one on trial.

9
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:57,034
Oh   you should be. You should be!

10
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:58,201
This is personal.

11
00:01:58,234 --> 00:01:59,367
Fuck yes   this is personal.

12
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:00,900
And it should be personal for you too.

13
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:03,067
As my friend. I'm asking you to do this for me.

14
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,234
Sorry   no.

15
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:05,934
Well   then fuck you!

16
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:08,733
Miguel went missing last night. Ellen's missing this morning.

17
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:10,034
I hope she didn't get in an accident or something.

18
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:12,800
He did it. Miguel really did it.

19
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,568
Wow   i didn't get it before miguel

20
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,733
But you can't be reasoned with  guilted controlled.

21
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:20,367
This whole back and forth game for leverage is pointless.

22
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:21,700
That's right!

23
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:25,367
I'll do what i want when i want to whomever i want.

24
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:27,733
Count on it!

25
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:28,934
Yes we will marry you.

26
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:30,534
You should be my best man.

27
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,234
What?

28
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:33,501
I trust you more than anyone.

29
00:02:33,534 --> 00:02:34,700
Why are you running your mouth

30
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,267
About family business to a god damn stranger?

31
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:38,100
Dexter is not the problem here.

32
00:02:38,134 --> 00:02:40,334
Better keep your fucking hands off of me   pendejo !

33
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:42,067
Ellen wolf's ring.

34
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,900
Ellen wolf was threatening to wreck his career.

35
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:45,917
He has a black suv

36
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:47,900
and no alibi for the night she died.

37
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,334
You think miguel had something to do with her murder?

38
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:52,833
I found this sample in the back of his car.

39
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:54,234
While laguerta's deciding

40
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:55,401
I'll be eliminating her problem.

41
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:56,601
And george king's going to help me.

42
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,234
I'll copy his m.O.

43
00:02:58,267 --> 00:03:00,201
They won't even look for another suspect.

44
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:02,067
I am this close to getting my shield

45
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,367
And i'm putting it all at risk to be with you!

46
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,467
Then debra  why are you?!

47
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:07,534
I need for you to seriously think about us.

48
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:10,301
You've had a bug up your ass about dad for months now.

49
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:13,134
He didn't cheat on mom.

50
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,501
Bullshit. Who?

51
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:17,100
A c.I.

52
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:20,000
Laura moser. My mother.

53
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,367
I kinda need a favor.

54
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,100
That's what i'm here for. What do you need?

55
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:25,534
All the records you have on my dad's confidential informants.

56
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,833
Skinner. George king.

57
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:30,034
The nicaraguan embassy is still giving me the runaround.

58
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:32,034
Until we know king's true identity

59
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:33,367
There's not much to go on.

60
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:34,867
You need to have a long conversation

61
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,767
With dexter morgan.

62
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,900
You think i'm done with you?

63
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:40,867
You think this ends here?

64
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,167
It doesn't!

65
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:43,334
It does for you.

66
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:07,434
There are few milestones in life

67
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:12,067
That evoke a stronger response than our final act.

68
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,067
Death.

69
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:59,334
What was once moving  speaking  killing  and threatening

70
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:03,301
Becomes nothing but an empty vessel.

71
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:06,134
Which is not so different from how i've always felt.

72
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:07,767
Several patches of skin removed from the   uh--

73
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,334
The shoulder area.

74
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,234
Ligature marks on the neck.

75
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:15,501
Why the fuck would the skinner wanna kill miguel prado?

76
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:17,234
Miguel was after freebo.

77
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,467
King had to figure he knew something.

78
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:25,467
We all react in different ways to death.

79
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:28,401
Some  like ramon  choose anger.

80
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:32,767
Others cling to ritual.

81
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,167
Dex.

82
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,733
I know he was your friend.

83
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:40,201
So if you wanna take a pass on this...

84
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:42,367
Nah that's all right. I got it.

85
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:43,900
Me  i'll play the grieving friend

86
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:46,434
Who buries himself in his work.

87
00:06:00,134 --> 00:06:02,568
You can tell a lot about a person

88
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:06,267
By the friends he keeps.

89
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:11,100
And this is my best friend.

90
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:21,833
Good-Bye   miguel.

91
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:25,934
Don't fucking touch my brother.

92
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:29,034
Let go of my arm.

93
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:32,334
Now.

94
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,000
Come here.

95
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:39,700
I am going to find out why this happened.

96
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,367
We all want the same thing   ramon.

97
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:02,234
That was awkward.

98
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:05,900
I don't think i've ever been asked to leave a funeral before.

99
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:09,234
Ramon didn't ask you to leave   he pushed you out the door.

100
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:11,201
Yeah   he was drunk.

101
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:13,234
I could smell the fumes.

102
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,501
He's just so angry.

103
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:17,634
He's lost two brothers.

104
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:19,867
He doesn't know who to blame.

105
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,534
Well certainly not you.

106
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:24,234
No certainly not me.

107
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:29,967
How you handling this?

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,767
Oh  you know  a lotta different emotions.

109
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,534
I know miguel wasn't the man you thought he was.

110
00:07:37,568 --> 00:07:38,833
But you lost a friend.

111
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:42,167
You don't have to be so strong.

112
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:46,301
Can't help it.

113
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:48,267
Oh poor syl.

114
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,167
She has so much to deal with.

115
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:52,501
I can only imagine.

116
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:53,867
She insists we go through with the wedding.

117
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,201
She still wants to come

118
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:57,334
To the rehearsal dinner tomorrow night. Well...

119
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:03,267
Life goes on.

120
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:04,534
From your mother?

121
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:07,900
Mmm. She's not coming down.

122
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:09,700
She started teaching again

123
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:11,134
And can't miss class.

124
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:13,301
Too bad.

125
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:16,800
That's my loving mother.

126
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,134
"Let's hope the third one's the charm."

127
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,833
What's that mean?

128
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:25,833
The kid.

129
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:27,967
The third kid is the charm.

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,467
Cody and astor are charms too.

131
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:34,401
Like i said   that's my loving mother.

132
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:37,301
Did rita just lie to me?

133
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:41,434
So have you written your vows yet?

134
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:44,501
Not completely.

135
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:45,601
What should i say?

136
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:50,833
Well you can talk about togetherness

137
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:53,934
Loyalty   attraction   honesty.

138
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:58,733
Honesty. Right.

139
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:03,234
You know i should get home and keep working on them.

140
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:06,167
Mmm. You should keep that.

141
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:14,733
He gave me so much.

142
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:17,000
Darling rita

143
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:18,568
Once you were a dream and a prayer.

144
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,800
Now our future is as bright as the sun

145
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,568
Glinting off the morning dew.

146
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:24,034
And i vow that i will...

147
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:28,000
Sounds like i'm marrying a unicorn.

148
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
'Scuse me   sir.

149
00:09:57,733 --> 00:09:59,601
You the occupant?

150
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:01,334
Yeah. I'm detective pratt.

151
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,267
Property manager called us. They found your door open.

152
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:05,601
Yeah   he called me too.

153
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:07,867
We're gonna need you to take a good look around

154
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,867
And see what's missing.

155
00:10:12,434 --> 00:10:14,367
It's kinda hard to tell.

156
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:15,733
Your neighbor   a ms. Levin

157
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:18,167
Saw someone hanging around the mailboxes.

158
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,700
Latin   kinda burly   goatee.

159
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:20,700
Ring any bells?

160
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:23,401
Ramon prado.

161
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:24,934
No.

162
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,668
Thanks. Let me know if you find out anything.

163
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,668
You got it. Thank you.

164
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:05,967
Miguel warned you that his death

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,501
Wasn't gonna be the end of things.

166
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:13,501
So his plan was to make me hire a housekeeper?

167
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:17,000
Your suit for the wedding.

168
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:20,334
That's personal.

169
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:25,067
Ramon prado's like a gut-Shot animal.

170
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,234
You know what to do with a wounded animal.

171
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:30,900
You put it out of its misery.

172
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,401
I can't kill him. He doesn't meet the code.

173
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:39,334
Can't kill him.

174
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:40,700
Can't ignore him.

175
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:54,201
I have no intention of ignoring him.

176
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,816
I can use the ring

177
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:00,833
to tie miguel to ellen wolf's murder

178
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,201
Threaten to destroy

179
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:05,201
Ramon's sainted brother's reputation forever.

180
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:10,668
That's enough to get ramon to back down.

181
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,700
Sara.

182
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:13,767
Dexter?

183
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,301
How are you?

184
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:18,800
Honestly   not so great.

185
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,467
I'm sorry   is--Is ramon in?

186
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:22,767
No.

187
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,301
He didn't come home with us from the funeral.

188
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:27,467
Doesn't answer his cell.

189
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:30,367
He's been on a bender   dexter; i have no idea where he is.

190
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:34,833
I'm really worried about him.

191
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:36,700
If you hear from him

192
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:38,000
Will you let him know i stopped by?

193
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:48,900
Ramon's blood family doesn't know where he is.

194
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,967
Maybe his blue family does.

195
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:00,800
Morning. Sheriff's department.

196
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,334
Yeah could you put me through

197
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:04,067
To sergeant jessie whitaker please?

198
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,067
One moment please.

199
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,234
Gail brandon.

200
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:14,934
Future mother-In-Law.

201
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:18,733
While i'm waiting i may as well check into my new partner.

202
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,501
Sergeant whitaker's in the field.

203
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:24,067
Would you like to leave a message?

204
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,234
This is sort of important. I'm with miami metro homicide.

205
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:28,534
You think you can track him down?

206
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:30,034
Please hold.

207
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:35,367
Before she left michigan rita bennet would have been

208
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:39,401
Rita...brandon.

209
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,000
Ackerman.

210
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:46,401
Paul bennet wasn't her first husband.

211
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:51,800
She was married before at 16.

212
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,234
Ending in divorce six months later.

213
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,367
An impetuous teen marriage.

214
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:59,833
Which makes me her third husband.

215
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:01,900
The charm.

216
00:14:01,934 --> 00:14:03,967
The brass is giving us a blank check

217
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,234
As far as overtime is concerned

218
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,301
Until this man is in custody.

219
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:09,067
Jorge orozco.

220
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,434
A.K.A. George king.

221
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:15,501
Affectionately known back home as the blade.

222
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:17,401
Orozco was a captain

223
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:18,568
In the resistencia nicaraguense.

224
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:20,000
The contras.

225
00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:22,401
He headed an interrogation unit.

226
00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:25,034
He tortured people for a living.

227
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:28,401
And killed 'em.

228
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,568
Now this already was a big case.

229
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:35,401
With miguel prado's murder

230
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:37,401
It's officially huge.

231
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:40,601
This is whitaker.

232
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:42,367
Hi   my name is dexter morgan.

233
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:46,334
I'm trying to track down your old partner ramon prado.

234
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,100
Why?

235
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:50,434
I'm a family friend.

236
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:53,267
Sara told me he's been missing since his brother's funeral.

237
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:55,833
I figured with his problem and all...

238
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:58,568
Gotcha.

239
00:14:58,601 --> 00:15:00,767
Actually   i haven't seen him since he left.

240
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,434
I know a few places he used to hang out at.

241
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,867
I mean   basically any bar within a ten-Mile radius.

242
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,334
I can give you a few of his favorites   if you like.

243
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,267
I'm sure sara would appreciate that.

244
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:13,867
Yeah i'm sure.

245
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,568
I'd love to help them with george king

246
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:19,000
But i've got a more pressing situation to deal with.

247
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:23,700
Miguel's wounded messenger.

248
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:25,833
Morgan...a minute?

249
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:28,800
Sure   sarge.

250
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,601
So it took a couple of months and a lot of wrangling

251
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:38,601
But my budget request finally came through.

252
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:41,568
Homicide is gonna get a little extra money.

253
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:42,900
Oh   that's great. Mm-Hmm.

254
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:44,634
We should get one of those crime-Sight imagers.

255
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:45,634
Have you seen 'em?

256
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:46,867
Their pictures are amazing.

257
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,367
Really?

258
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:50,668
I mean   that's what you'd spend it on?

259
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,267
'Cause i was thinking maybe we'd spend it on

260
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,067
Adding another detective to our squad.

261
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,134
Maybe somebody who saved the life of a c.I.

262
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,367
Who id'd our skinner.

263
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,900
I don't know what to say   i mean   wow.

264
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:14,401
Thank you.

265
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:17,501
I put in the recommendation to lieutenant laguerta.

266
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:19,067
She's just gotta sign the paperwork.

267
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,301
Oh   fuck. Thank you   thank you.

268
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:23,700
We could use it a little joy around here.

269
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,034
Good work.

270
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,534
Thank you.

271
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:36,334
I got it.

272
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:38,301
I'm guessing "it" is something good?

273
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:39,934
My detective shield.

274
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:42,434
Oh   big news.

275
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:43,934
It's gigantic news.

276
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:45,467
All laguerta has to do is sign the papers and i'm golden.

277
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:47,000
Well   i'm silver.

278
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:48,401
We should celebrate.

279
00:16:48,434 --> 00:16:49,634
Yeah   come on.

280
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:50,967
I mean later.

281
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,568
I gotta pick up the kids   go to the tailor's...

282
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:53,967
Oh   yeah   yeah.

283
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,067
You know   dad would be proud.

284
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:02,800
That still means something   no matter how flawed he was.

285
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,900
Yeah   look at us.

286
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:07,534
You're getting married.

287
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,568
I'm making detective.

288
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:14,534
The morgans are gonna be all right.

289
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:15,767
I'll see you at the rehearsal dinner.

290
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,767
Okay.

291
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:26,034
Yo   francis.

292
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:28,501
Any progress on my dad's c.I. Files?

293
00:17:28,534 --> 00:17:30,800
Ooh   he knew a lot of folks   i'll give him that.

294
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:31,967
Anyone of interest?

295
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,934
I haven't culled through everything yet.

296
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:36,100
Are you sure you want me to?

297
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:38,934
So things are better left in a box.

298
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:44,067
I just...I need put a face on her

299
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:47,233
Uh,you know all the details isn't gonna change

300
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,100
In the fact that he was messing around on the sly.

301
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:53,167
I know.

302
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:55,401
I'll send 'em up as soon as i can.

303
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:57,267
Thank you   francis.

304
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:03,001
Dexter.

305
00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:06,633
I need a word.

306
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:14,134
City council has voted to name the freeway interchange

307
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:15,934
Near my house after miguel prado.

308
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:19,401
I drive that way every single day.

309
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:22,267
He was a hero.

310
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,967
To some.

311
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:25,368
He was a cold-Blooded killer.

312
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:27,900
He murdered my friend   and now he's got an interchange?

313
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:30,800
I'm sorry.

314
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:32,767
I'm sorry--

315
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,301
You're the only other person who knows the truth.

316
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:41,900
Maybe it's time we let others in on the secret.

317
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:43,500
There is nothing to link miguel

318
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:45,500
To ellen wolf's murder

319
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:47,500
Except evidence that was obtained illegally

320
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:48,500
And therefore inadmissible.

321
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:49,600
I'll find something.

322
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:51,667
I'll tear his life apart if i have to.

323
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,567
He doesn't have a life anymore.

324
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,468
It's his family you'd have to tear apart.

325
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,834
The community. The cuban community.

326
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:01,767
And you still might not be able to prove anything.

327
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:06,700
So i just keep it a secret.

328
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:11,167
I hate secrets.

329
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:13,934
We all have them.

330
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:19,434
Well   then tell me   dexter.

331
00:19:19,468 --> 00:19:21,800
How am i supposed to live with this?

332
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:27,533
You just do.

333
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:31,700
Can i get an everything burrito and a side of beans

334
00:19:31,734 --> 00:19:33,867
Maybe a little bit of--

335
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,667
Anton.

336
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,434
Hey. Hi.

337
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,101
You're here. Yeah.

338
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:40,867
Yeah   i was just   um   picking up some things from evidence.

339
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,600
My wallet   watch   chapstick.

340
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:43,767
I could've brought that to you.

341
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,334
Oh   it's cool. It's cool   i got it.

342
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:48,134
So how you doing?

343
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,201
I'm all right. Good.

344
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:51,900
Oh   but--

345
00:19:51,934 --> 00:19:53,700
Looks like i'm gonna get my detective shield.

346
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,734
Debra   wow   that's great.

347
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:57,533
Thank you. Congratulations.

348
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,234
That's good. That's good.

349
00:19:59,267 --> 00:20:00,767
You wanna get some co-- I should probably go.

350
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,067
Okay.

351
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,067
I'll see ya.

352
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,533
I'll see you.

353
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,468
I stopped at four bars   got a new appreciation

354
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,201
For how many alcoholics there are in miami.

355
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:23,267
But still no ramon.

356
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,800
Morgan.

357
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:36,834
What's up?

358
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:44,667
I just found out from the a.D.A.'S office

359
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,201
That they're requesting logs

360
00:20:46,234 --> 00:20:48,567
From the anton briggs surveillance detail.

361
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,934
Now   i didn't know why until i read 'em.

362
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:56,600
You slept with our key witness?

363
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:57,800
The a.D.A.'S looking into it?

364
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:00,267
Miguel prado was.

365
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,633
I don't know what the status of it is now.

366
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:04,934
But it's a conflict.

367
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:07,234
And you should have given me the heads up.

368
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:10,201
Especially before i sent

369
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:12,633
My recommendation to laguerta for your shield.

370
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,101
You're gonna spike it now?

371
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:17,234
Laguerta has final say.

372
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:18,667
But she deserves full disclosure.

373
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,834
Disclosure? Really   sarge?

374
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:24,434
Did you disclose that you met gianna

375
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:25,533
Because you were out strolling for a hooker?

376
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:29,667
Where did you hear that?

377
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,468
I--

378
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,734
Where'd you hear that?

379
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:36,001
I know someone in vice.

380
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:37,800
I'm the only one that knows   i think.

381
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:39,567
It's not even that big of a deal.

382
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,001
Fuck   fuck! I am sorry. I'm sorry.

383
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:49,667
It's just my chickens coming home to roost.

384
00:21:52,934 --> 00:21:55,633
Oh   fuck. Fuck.

385
00:22:05,301 --> 00:22:06,900
I met detective gianna

386
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:09,001
While seeking the comfort of prostitutes.

387
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:10,368
'Scuse me?

388
00:22:10,401 --> 00:22:12,700
I propositioned her.

389
00:22:12,734 --> 00:22:15,234
She revealed to me to be police.

390
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,401
She had mercy on me; she let me off with a warning.

391
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:19,967
It was a dark time for me.

392
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:21,350
I completely understand

393
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,700
if you wanna pursue a case against me.

394
00:22:22,734 --> 00:22:25,767
As cases go

395
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,368
Laying you out for thinking with your dick

396
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:28,934
Is pretty low on my list of priorities.

397
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:32,834
Actually   i was looking for simple human connection.

398
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:34,800
No. Right.

399
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:38,234
You're right.

400
00:22:38,267 --> 00:22:40,500
We all have secrets we prefer not to share   angel.

401
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:43,301
Skeletons.

402
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:46,600
Feel free to keep yours in the closet.

403
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:47,600
Deep in the closet.

404
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:48,633
Thanks   maria.

405
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:53,267
There's something else you should hear from me

406
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:54,533
Instead of the grapevine.

407
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:56,967
Angel   how--How dark of a time was this?

408
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,800
It's regarding my recommendation of

409
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,600
debra morgan for detective.

410
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,134
So   when you and mom get married

411
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,967
What should we call you?

412
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,734
Um   i think mr. Handsome

413
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:27,234
Would be a good name.

414
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:34,734
Is that you   ramon?

415
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:36,500
Uh   you can call me whatever you want.

416
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:39,401
I think we'll just call you dexter.

417
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:42,700
That sounds good.

418
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,600
Following me

419
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:49,434
With kids in my car?

420
00:23:49,468 --> 00:23:50,900
Now you're just pissing me off.

421
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,867
Moment of truth.

422
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,101
Stop or get a ticket   asshole.

423
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:07,800
Did you see that   dexter?

424
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:10,284
Yeah   that's what happens

425
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:12,734
when drivers do stupid things.

426
00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:25,001
Looks like he's okay enough to walk away.

427
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,700
Until i get a hold of him.

428
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,633
This is gonna be a nice dinner.

429
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:35,234
Thank you for doing this   dexter.

430
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:38,267
Just doing what grooms are supposed to do.

431
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:41,067
So how are you coming along with your vows?

432
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:42,767
Still working on 'em.

433
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,067
I'm going to lob this in nice and easy.

434
00:24:45,101 --> 00:24:47,267
What kind of vows did you do the first time around?

435
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:49,633
The first time?

436
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:53,001
Well   paul and i just recited whatever the pastor said.

437
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,767
Liar   liar   pants on fire.

438
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,134
Maitre d' said we'd be seated in 15 minutes.

439
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:09,567
Un-Fucking-Believable.

440
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,201
Ramon   why don't we go outside and talk about this.

441
00:25:11,234 --> 00:25:12,533
Fuck you.

442
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:14,500
You don't tell me what to do.

443
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:15,800
Look   these people have nothing to do with this.

444
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:17,500
This is between you and me   right?

445
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,967
I should put a bullet in your head.

446
00:25:21,001 --> 00:25:22,900
In front of everybody.

447
00:25:22,934 --> 00:25:25,067
So they can see what it's like to lose someone.

448
00:25:27,434 --> 00:25:29,734
Ramon.

449
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:31,834
Come on   you need to put the gun down

450
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:32,834
Before anyone gets hurt.

451
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:33,867
Freeze   asshole.

452
00:25:38,434 --> 00:25:39,867
Get your hands off me!

453
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,001
I will   as soon as i get

454
00:25:41,034 --> 00:25:43,134
Some of your sheriff buddies down here!

455
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:50,767
Thank you.

456
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:54,034
They all say the same thing.

457
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:56,167
"King was a very polite gardener.

458
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:57,368
I can't believe he's the skinner."

459
00:25:57,401 --> 00:25:59,434
I hate polite killers.

460
00:25:59,468 --> 00:26:01,468
I heard you took down ramon prado last night.

461
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,734
Again.

462
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:04,201
Yeah   the prados must love me.

463
00:26:04,234 --> 00:26:06,533
Morgan.

464
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:08,101
You gonna eat that?

465
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:09,700
Not anymore   thanks.

466
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,567
That was robbery.

467
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,334
There was a hit-And-Run fender bender

468
00:26:13,368 --> 00:26:14,734
Involving a stolen car.

469
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:16,201
Traffic enforcement caught the guy's face.

470
00:26:16,234 --> 00:26:19,334
Guess who.

471
00:26:19,368 --> 00:26:20,767
They're sending a photo over right now.

472
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:27,434
George fucking king.

473
00:26:27,468 --> 00:26:28,734
God   that's definitely him.

474
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:30,633
Robbery's sending the car in right now.

475
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:31,633
I'll grab my kit.

476
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:32,633
We'll tear that car apart.

477
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:56,434
By the book   mr. Morgan.

478
00:26:56,468 --> 00:26:59,600
If you need us   we're right outside   lieutenant.

479
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:01,533
Thanks.

480
00:27:05,034 --> 00:27:06,368
How's it feel   ramon?

481
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:07,567
How the fuck does what feel?

482
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,900
Wake up sober for the first time in a week.

483
00:27:09,934 --> 00:27:11,067
Like shit.

484
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:12,468
Yeah   that shit's called reality.

485
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,334
It's gonna be life as you know it for a long time.

486
00:27:14,368 --> 00:27:17,234
I'm gonna be outta here in a couple of days.

487
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:25,001
One last coupon from your famous brother's reputation.

488
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:26,301
Something like that.

489
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:27,767
So you don't really have to bother with reality.

490
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,834
That must be nice.

491
00:27:28,867 --> 00:27:31,834
You know what my fucking reality is?

492
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,234
Miguel takes me on as a bodyguard

493
00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:34,234
And i ask him why.

494
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:36,267
You know what he says?

495
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:39,734
To protect him from you.

496
00:27:41,934 --> 00:27:43,600
Did he say why?

497
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:45,234
No.

498
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:47,667
The only one miguel needed

499
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,067
protection from was himself.

500
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,034
The man was paranoid.

501
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:54,001
That's not true. That's true.

502
00:27:54,034 --> 00:27:56,934
You know it as well as i do.

503
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,600
Look   i spent a lot of time with your brother

504
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:02,800
But it wasn't 24/7; i don't know what he was up to

505
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:04,633
When i wasn't around.

506
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:06,067
Neither does syl   neither do you.

507
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:13,567
What i do know is this

508
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,067
You got a really ugly history.

509
00:28:18,101 --> 00:28:20,800
Kidnapping   brutality   abuse.

510
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:24,533
You trashed my apartment   you followed me.

511
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:26,600
You put a gun in my face in front of my friends

512
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:28,934
In front of my pregnant fiancee.

513
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:30,600
Why   ramon? What's your endgame?

514
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:33,401
To hurt you.

515
00:28:33,434 --> 00:28:37,900
Until you came into our life   everything was fine.

516
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:39,301
Fine like what?

517
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:41,401
Like oscar's drug problem?

518
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:43,667
Like miguel's...darkness?

519
00:28:47,867 --> 00:28:49,667
What do you know about that?

520
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,334
We were close.

521
00:28:51,368 --> 00:28:52,934
Miguel and i. He told me things.

522
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,267
He told me how he pushed your father down the stairs

523
00:28:57,301 --> 00:28:59,201
To protect oscar and you.

524
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:03,001
And that he enjoyed it.

525
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:07,001
He fucking told you that?

526
00:29:08,368 --> 00:29:10,900
It was me that did that to our father.

527
00:29:10,934 --> 00:29:16,334
Miguel took it from me; made it his story.

528
00:29:16,368 --> 00:29:19,334
Part of his god damn legend.

529
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:24,500
Miguel always had to be the star.

530
00:29:24,533 --> 00:29:27,533
He got the looks   the charm

531
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:30,134
Maybe even the brains   but i got the strength.

532
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:33,201
I spent my whole life trying to hold it together

533
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:35,201
And now it's all gone to shit.

534
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:38,267
It doesn't have to.

535
00:29:38,301 --> 00:29:40,434
Bullshit.

536
00:29:40,468 --> 00:29:42,034
Those cases you're talking about

537
00:29:42,067 --> 00:29:44,934
The kidnapping   the brutality...

538
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:47,134
That was me sweeping up after miguel's fuck-Ups.

539
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:51,234
He wasn't making my problems go away

540
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:55,101
I was risking my ass to cover his.

541
00:29:55,134 --> 00:29:59,001
I know the frustration   the disappointment

542
00:29:59,034 --> 00:30:01,700
Of wanting to help your brother and not being able to.

543
00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:10,134
Where's your son right now?

544
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:13,767
Soccer practice.

545
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,468
Your daughter?

546
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:20,001
Preschool.

547
00:30:20,034 --> 00:30:22,834
Where do they think their father is?

548
00:30:22,867 --> 00:30:28,267
Sara told them something. I--I don't know.

549
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:31,500
Someday your kids will be old enough

550
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:33,867
To see the truth for themselves.

551
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,500
Just like you did with your father.

552
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:41,434
I know. I've been there.

553
00:30:41,468 --> 00:30:43,900
The sins of the father go on and on

554
00:30:43,934 --> 00:30:46,167
From kid to kid to kid.

555
00:30:46,201 --> 00:30:50,334
Unless someone--You--

556
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,334
Chooses to end them.

557
00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:04,567
I've been there too.

558
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,633
You don't always have to destroy a wounded animal.

559
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:15,533
Sometimes you just remove the thorn.

560
00:31:17,734 --> 00:31:20,101
Those dark lines...

561
00:31:20,134 --> 00:31:21,301
Reticulated veins.

562
00:31:21,334 --> 00:31:23,334
Oh   holy shit   it is skin.

563
00:31:23,368 --> 00:31:26,001
No   more like...

564
00:31:26,034 --> 00:31:27,001
More like leaf.

565
00:31:27,034 --> 00:31:28,834
So the only evidence we got

566
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:31,101
from the car that skinner stole is a frigging leaf?

567
00:31:31,134 --> 00:31:32,767
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

568
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,201
Yup. Tobacco leaf.

569
00:31:36,234 --> 00:31:38,934
Tobacco?

570
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:43,633
Fuckin'-A   wasn't there a--

571
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:45,267
King's   uh   former employer

572
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:46,334
What was the name?

573
00:31:46,368 --> 00:31:48,401
Thank you   vince. You're welcome.

574
00:31:48,434 --> 00:31:50,468
Cigar company. What was it called?

575
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:56,067
El royale cigar company.

576
00:31:56,101 --> 00:31:57,301
It's listed on the first tax form

577
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:58,633
Filled out by king in 1992.

578
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,734
Come on   let's go.

579
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:08,767
What do you think?

580
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
It's great.

581
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:11,334
Thanks for doing this so fast   bruno.

582
00:32:11,368 --> 00:32:12,500
Happy to help.

583
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:14,067
Now   you do that.

584
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:15,667
Okay. And i'll get your shoes.

585
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,301
All right.

586
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:26,934
Remember what i taught you.

587
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:29,767
How could i forget?

588
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,334
Mom's funeral.

589
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,800
The rabbit...

590
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:37,267
Hops over the log.

591
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:40,167
Your mother would be so proud.

592
00:32:40,201 --> 00:32:43,500
Both of them.

593
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:47,201
The rabbit crawls under the log.

594
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:50,800
The rabbit runs around the log...

595
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:51,934
One more time

596
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:56,001
Because he's trying to outsmart the fox.

597
00:32:56,034 --> 00:32:57,934
The rabbit...

598
00:32:57,967 --> 00:33:01,834
Dives through his rabbit hole.

599
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:05,867
Safe and sound.

600
00:33:08,234 --> 00:33:10,767
Safe and sound.

601
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,967
Safe and sound.

602
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:21,800
What's this?

603
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:22,967
All we got out of searching the cigar factory.

604
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,034
Total waste of time.

605
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:25,434
No sign of king?

606
00:33:25,468 --> 00:33:27,034
The security guard's there 'round the clock.

607
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:30,167
No way king gets in or out.

608
00:33:34,434 --> 00:33:38,301
Tomorrow is my wedding day.

609
00:33:38,334 --> 00:33:41,401
Some men would be excited.

610
00:33:41,434 --> 00:33:44,633
Others panicky.

611
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,967
Me?

612
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:49,767
I feel...calm.

613
00:34:00,101 --> 00:34:01,500
What are you doing here on a saturday?

614
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:06,134
I'm just   uh   reanalyzing some of the evidence

615
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:07,633
From king's stolen car.

616
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,900
Francis   you came through.

617
00:34:20,134 --> 00:34:21,134
Morgan.

618
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:23,767
Glad you're here. I wanna talk to you.

619
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,334
Oh   shit.

620
00:34:25,368 --> 00:34:28,034
I didn't know she was here.

621
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,334
Did i say anything bad about her?

622
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:34,434
You're not the one she's gonna ream.

623
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,468
Sit.

624
00:34:50,234 --> 00:34:51,533
That's okay.

625
00:34:55,067 --> 00:34:56,567
It seems the a.D.A. Has noticed

626
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,167
That your personal and professional lives

627
00:34:58,201 --> 00:34:59,167
Are colliding.

628
00:34:59,201 --> 00:35:01,934
All right.

629
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:05,800
Listen   anton wasn't officially a c.I. When that happened.

630
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:10,134
So it was a one-Time thing?

631
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:11,967
No.

632
00:35:12,001 --> 00:35:14,067
Still going on?

633
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:18,101
I'm not sure.

634
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:20,067
Do you want it to?

635
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:27,301
I don't know. He could be a key witness in my case.

636
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:31,334
Doesn't have to be your case.

637
00:35:31,368 --> 00:35:36,934
You know what.

638
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:39,900
You go ahead.

639
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:41,967
You take away my case   you take away my shield.

640
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:45,001
I don't care anymore.

641
00:35:45,034 --> 00:35:47,700
Because it wasn't the wrong decision.

642
00:35:47,734 --> 00:35:50,500
I wanted to be with anton.

643
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:53,700
I still want to be with anton.

644
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,267
And there is no possible way

645
00:35:55,301 --> 00:35:57,434
That us being together is a mistake.

646
00:35:57,468 --> 00:36:00,101
Which means you're not

647
00:36:00,134 --> 00:36:02,034
Sacrificing your personal life to work.

648
00:36:06,234 --> 00:36:07,368
Good for you.

649
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:17,434
Congratulations   detective morgan.

650
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:21,334
What?

651
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:24,468
You're one of the smartest   hardest working

652
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,101
Most annoying pain-In-The-Ass cops

653
00:36:27,134 --> 00:36:28,434
In my department.

654
00:36:28,468 --> 00:36:31,301
And you've earned this.

655
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:43,201
What about the a.D.A.'S ethics probe?

656
00:36:48,633 --> 00:36:51,301
The a.D.A. Is dead.

657
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,167
Try one of these.

658
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:02,401
Ganache frosting.

659
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:07,101
You hold onto that personal life.

660
00:37:07,134 --> 00:37:08,301
Yeah.

661
00:37:08,334 --> 00:37:11,301
Reminds us what's important.

662
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:13,967
Cupcakes.

663
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:16,700
Abso-Fucking-Lutely.

664
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:32,800
Such a familiar situation.

665
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,434
Such an unfamiliar perspective.

666
00:37:45,368 --> 00:37:47,334
George king.

667
00:37:47,368 --> 00:37:49,800
So ramon wasn't the only one following me.

668
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,267
I underestimated miguel after all.

669
00:37:52,301 --> 00:37:56,967
This is the part where my fear is supposed to build.

670
00:37:57,001 --> 00:37:58,967
I know his m.O. By heart.

671
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:03,134
But you're not afraid.

672
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,500
No.

673
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:08,533
I'm not.

674
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:12,500
I am.

675
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:16,401
I've been scared of it coming to this your whole life.

676
00:38:16,434 --> 00:38:17,567
A violent end.

677
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:22,567
I tried to protect you.

678
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,667
And you did.

679
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,101
This is my fault for not trusting you.

680
00:38:26,134 --> 00:38:29,201
Instead i trusted miguel fucking prado.

681
00:38:29,234 --> 00:38:34,934
You did the best you could.

682
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:37,134
I need you to understand something   dexter.

683
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:41,034
So did i.

684
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:43,334
The very best that i could.

685
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:47,001
I hope to be half as good a father to my son.

686
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:51,934
Your son.

687
00:38:51,967 --> 00:38:53,368
Dad.

688
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,167
I forgive you.

689
00:39:00,434 --> 00:39:03,834
I've never seen you cry before.

690
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:07,167
They're not my tears   dex.

691
00:39:07,201 --> 00:39:08,167
They're yours.

692
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:12,600
I know   but i've never...

693
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:14,767
I've never felt this.

694
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,434
You've never had a son before.

695
00:39:18,468 --> 00:39:20,267
You want to see him come into the world.

696
00:39:20,301 --> 00:39:23,767
Yes.

697
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,134
To raise him with rita.

698
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:30,101
To watch him grow up.

699
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,434
To protect him. I know.

700
00:39:32,468 --> 00:39:34,167
I didn't.

701
00:39:34,201 --> 00:39:38,234
Until now   when it's all gonna be taken away.

702
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:42,900
I wanna be there for him.

703
00:39:42,934 --> 00:39:45,900
I've never wanted anything so much in my life.

704
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,834
Come in.

705
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,867
You're completely different from me.

706
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,600
You're laid-Back

707
00:40:13,633 --> 00:40:18,401
And musician-Y   and...un-Ambitious.

708
00:40:18,434 --> 00:40:21,434
You're like valium.

709
00:40:21,468 --> 00:40:24,567
And you're like red bull.

710
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,468
You are the best thing that has happened to me.

711
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
I'm still a witness in your case.

712
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:32,767
It's not my case.

713
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,667
I recused myself.

714
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,167
You gave up a case--This case?

715
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:37,234
I had a choice.

716
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:39,700
I chose you.

717
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:44,334
Your turn.

718
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:49,667
I've already chosen.

719
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:57,533
Hold on. Hold on   i'll turn it off.

720
00:40:57,567 --> 00:41:00,101
Wait   just   uh--

721
00:41:00,134 --> 00:41:01,334
What?

722
00:41:01,368 --> 00:41:03,834
George king wasn't at that cigar factory.

723
00:41:03,867 --> 00:41:07,500
Fucking duh   but that's not my case anymore.

724
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:09,001
Why?

725
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:10,368
Well   i re-Ran the tobacco

726
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,667
That we got from george king's stolen car.

727
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,401
It turns out it's at least a dozen years old.

728
00:41:14,434 --> 00:41:15,567
I called the cigar factory.

729
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,633
They only moved in there three years ago.

730
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:20,468
Where'd they move it?

731
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,001
I know that look.

732
00:41:26,034 --> 00:41:27,667
I've had that look.

733
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,001
He likes control.

734
00:41:30,034 --> 00:41:31,633
Needs it.

735
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:35,734
So i'll take it away from him.

736
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:39,800
I killed freebo.

737
00:41:41,734 --> 00:41:43,234
Sorry 'bout that.

738
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:46,468
I tied him up.

739
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,633
Not unlike this.

740
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:51,533
Stabbed him in the left carotid artery.

741
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:55,134
Used his 16-Inch   carbon steel

742
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:57,401
Bone saw to separate his limbs.

743
00:41:57,434 --> 00:41:59,334
I don't believe you.

744
00:41:59,368 --> 00:42:04,434
Divided them equally Amongst six biodegradable trash bags.

745
00:42:04,468 --> 00:42:07,934
Which are long gone now Carried north on the gulf stream.

746
00:42:14,234 --> 00:42:16,401
You're lying.

747
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:18,201
Usually.

748
00:42:18,234 --> 00:42:20,101
Not now.

749
00:42:20,134 --> 00:42:21,368
No point.

750
00:42:21,401 --> 00:42:24,667
Why would you have done such a thing?

751
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,934
Oh   i have my excuses and justifications

752
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:31,234
But   really   i just...

753
00:42:31,267 --> 00:42:32,334
Need to.

754
00:42:32,368 --> 00:42:34,067
Like you.

755
00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:36,301
You have your excuses

756
00:42:36,301 --> 00:42:38,334
Finding freebo   getting your money.

757
00:42:38,368 --> 00:42:41,267
But you know he's dead.

758
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:44,468
You know there's no money.

759
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,301
So really   you're just...

760
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:47,301
A killer.

761
00:42:47,334 --> 00:42:49,767
A monster.

762
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,301
The stuff of nightmares.

763
00:42:54,167 --> 00:42:56,700
I could kill you now.

764
00:42:56,734 --> 00:42:58,500
If you can convince yourself i'm lying.

765
00:42:58,533 --> 00:43:02,234
That you need to skin me to get information out of me.

766
00:43:02,267 --> 00:43:07,134
You are lying.

767
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,667
You do know where he is.

768
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,967
Miguel prado tell you that?

769
00:43:12,001 --> 00:43:13,967
He wanted me dead.

770
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:15,600
So he used you.

771
00:43:15,633 --> 00:43:18,734
He played on your obsession.

772
00:43:18,767 --> 00:43:21,234
It probably wasn't too hard.

773
00:43:21,267 --> 00:43:23,234
I mean   you're a little single-Minded.

774
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:27,934
Let's hope you're this talk active Once i get my tools.

775
00:43:37,134 --> 00:43:40,034
A wolf would chew off its own paw.

776
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:42,301
Its survival instinct is that fierce.

777
00:43:42,334 --> 00:43:44,101
So is mine.

778
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:20,067
Fuck!

779
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,401
King's truck   11:00.

780
00:44:33,533 --> 00:44:34,867
Shit!

781
00:44:45,368 --> 00:44:47,334
No way i could stop in time   ma'am.

782
00:44:47,368 --> 00:44:49,234
He fucking came out of nowhere.

783
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:02,267
Jesus   officer.

784
00:45:02,301 --> 00:45:04,234
He scraped his fucking skin off.

785
00:45:04,267 --> 00:45:07,734
Yeah   well   what goes around comes around.

786
00:45:07,767 --> 00:45:09,934
And it's detective.

787
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:18,101
Dexter's here.

788
00:45:18,134 --> 00:45:19,267
He just pulled up.

789
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:20,434
Oh   finally.

790
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,234
Nothing to be concerned about

791
00:45:22,267 --> 00:45:24,401
But he kind of had a little accident.

792
00:45:24,434 --> 00:45:26,334
What happened?

793
00:45:26,368 --> 00:45:28,101
He took a tumble down some stairs.

794
00:45:28,134 --> 00:45:29,633
Broke his hand. Oh   my god.

795
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:32,267
Rita   he's fine.

796
00:45:32,301 --> 00:45:33,301
He can't wait to get married.

797
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:35,468
Hi.

798
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,468
Dexter!

799
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,567
Dexter   your room is down the hall.

800
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,334
You cannot be in here.

801
00:45:39,368 --> 00:45:41,101
Wow. You look...

802
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:44,134
You can't see her 'til the wedding.

803
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:45,267
It's bad luck.

804
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:47,900
I think i got that one covered   sweetie.

805
00:45:47,934 --> 00:45:50,067
Oh   baby   are you okay?

806
00:45:50,101 --> 00:45:53,468
Just embarrassed   more than anything.

807
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,600
Sweetheart   why don't we go and do your makeup?

808
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:02,134
I'm sorry.

809
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:03,267
It's okay.

810
00:46:03,301 --> 00:46:04,368
You're not angry?

811
00:46:04,401 --> 00:46:06,368
Why would i be?

812
00:46:06,401 --> 00:46:08,001
It's not like you broke your hand on purpose.

813
00:46:08,034 --> 00:46:10,967
I'm just glad you're here.

814
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,468
Safe.

815
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,334
Me too.

816
00:46:14,368 --> 00:46:15,700
All right   now go   go.

817
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:18,368
Okay. Be ready in a jiffy.

818
00:46:23,301 --> 00:46:25,934
You really do look beautiful.

819
00:46:25,967 --> 00:46:28,633
She wants to hold onto her secret.

820
00:46:28,667 --> 00:46:30,600
And i'm going to respect that.

821
00:46:30,633 --> 00:46:32,401
It seems only fair

822
00:46:32,434 --> 00:46:34,867
Given the secrets i keep from her.

823
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,667
We all have secrets.

824
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,368
In that way   i'm just like everyone else.

825
00:46:39,401 --> 00:46:41,101
Sorta.

826
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:48,167
Heard about your little fall. Are you okay?

827
00:46:48,201 --> 00:46:49,167
Yeah   i'm fine.

828
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:51,533
I heard you nabbed george king?

829
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:52,533
Yeah.

830
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:54,800
Great   big   scary contra boogeyman

831
00:46:54,834 --> 00:46:57,134
Gets surrounded and takes the chicken-Shit way out.

832
00:46:57,167 --> 00:46:59,101
Death by cop.

833
00:46:59,134 --> 00:47:01,667
I'm glad he's the only one who got hurt.

834
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,001
Yeah   me too.

835
00:47:03,034 --> 00:47:05,067
Yuck.

836
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:06,633
Me in a dress. I feel like a transvestite.

837
00:47:10,767 --> 00:47:13,900
Come here.

838
00:47:13,934 --> 00:47:17,401
Rabbit goes under the log...

839
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:20,134
Hops over the log...

840
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:21,434
Again...

841
00:47:21,468 --> 00:47:23,567
Then...

842
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:28,500
Through his hole.

843
00:47:28,533 --> 00:47:32,633
Safe and sound.

844
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,368
Thanks.

845
00:47:36,401 --> 00:47:38,201
Just remember   cody has your rings.

846
00:47:38,234 --> 00:47:40,368
And don't lock your knees when you're standing up up there.

847
00:47:40,401 --> 00:47:42,967
You'll drop like a god damn stone.

848
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:44,234
Where are your vows?

849
00:47:44,267 --> 00:47:46,134
Right here.

850
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:47,934
I'm so happy for you.

851
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,934
Just wish dad could be here.

852
00:47:53,967 --> 00:47:56,201
I have a feeling he is.

853
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:02,767
Enough of this sappy shit.

854
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,434
Let's get you fucking hitched.

855
00:48:05,468 --> 00:48:08,201
I honor you.

856
00:48:08,234 --> 00:48:10,334
I love you.

857
00:48:10,368 --> 00:48:12,001
I marry you.

858
00:48:29,867 --> 00:48:34,368
I promise...

859
00:48:34,401 --> 00:48:36,967
To be the very best husband

860
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:42,700
And father That i can be.

861
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:49,800
A completely   utterly honest vow.

862
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:14,034
Dexter Morgan. Family man.

863
00:49:14,067 --> 00:49:16,301
All my previous attempts at human connection

864
00:49:16,334 --> 00:49:19,034
Have ended in... well   death.

865
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:21,934
And now i have a partner for life.

866
00:49:21,967 --> 00:49:24,800
How did that happen?

867
00:49:24,834 --> 00:49:27,001
Am i drawn to the safety of belonging

868
00:49:27,034 --> 00:49:31,500
Or being part of something bigger than me?

869
00:49:31,533 --> 00:49:34,267
Either way   i'm a married man.

870
00:49:34,301 --> 00:49:37,468
Soon to be a father.

871
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,301
But what do i have to offer a child?

872
00:49:41,334 --> 00:49:45,067
Just...me.

873
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:49,234
Demented daddy dexter.

874
00:49:49,267 --> 00:49:51,533
Maybe i'm making the biggest mistake of my life.

875
00:49:51,567 --> 00:49:54,267
But who's perfect? Certainly not me.

876
00:49:54,301 --> 00:49:57,834
Certainly not harry.

877
00:49:57,867 --> 00:50:02,401
Sure   i'm still who i was, Who i am.

878
00:50:02,434 --> 00:50:04,700
Question is   what do i become?

879
00:50:04,734 --> 00:50:07,700
There are so many blanks left to fill in.

880
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:11,500
But right now   at this moment   i'm content.

881
00:50:11,533 --> 00:50:13,934
Maybe even...

882
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:15,767
Happy.

883
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:20,500
And i have to admit   when all is said and done...

884
00:50:20,533 --> 00:50:23,533
Life is good.
