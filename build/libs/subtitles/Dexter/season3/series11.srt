1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,294
Previously on Dexter.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,046
I loaned Freebo that money.

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,090
This is about respect.

4
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,593
Anton!

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,221
Morgan, get out of the way!

6
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,556
You found me.

7
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:18,267
I never meant for any of this
to go down the way it did.

8
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:19,852
I shoulda told you
you were free and clear.

9
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,521
- So that was you?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,941
- Debra, you lied to me!
- I am not the enemy here.

11
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:28,069
I need for you to seriously think about us.

12
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,530
Life vests?

13
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:34,242
We can't exactly load up the cart
with axes and machetes now, can we?

14
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,662
Last Thursday,
I was having drinks with her,

15
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:41,457
and then the next day
I'm staring down at her dead body.

16
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,543
She's lucky to have you
watching out for her.

17
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,671
It's just like you watched out for me
with Oscar's case.

18
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,799
Wait.

19
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,843
I told Sylvia about Miguel
and LaGuerta.

20
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,303
So she thinks Miguel
is at LaGuerta's?

21
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,722
You fucker!

22
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,515
You are too good a liar, Miguel.

23
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,976
- Come on, baby, listen to me.
- Don't touch me! I'm done!

24
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,644
Did you see anyone else on the street?

25
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,523
There was some douchebag
with his high beams on, blinding me.

26
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:09,736
- What kind of car?
- Dark, black, SUV.

27
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:10,987
Think that's funny?

28
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,947
Not at all.
They said that stain would come out.

29
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,410
I am the last person you wanna fuck with,
because I will fuck you back!

30
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,578
Count on it!

31
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:19,787
I will.

32
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:24,083
Even Harry would agree,
Miguel has left me no other choice.

33
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,335
I kill him.

34
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,254
- Get a good look at him?
- His name?

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,672
Dexter Morgan.

36
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,840
You want Freebo?

37
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:34,177
Then you need to have
a long conversation with him.

38
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,967
So this is how it ends.

39
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,761
I've pictured it a thousand ways,
but never this.

40
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,848
Me bound in the trunk of a car.

41
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,740
I am so fucked.

42
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:05,661
Must be what your victims feel like.
Trapped, hopeless.

43
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,664
You got any more words of encouragement,
or are you just here to gloat?

44
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,166
I'm here for moral support.

45
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,876
You were right about Miguel.

46
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,212
He must have sent Ramon after me.

47
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,381
- Dexter...
- I know I only have myself to blame.

48
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:21,469
I don't blame you for wanting a friend,
a normal life.

49
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,681
- You don't?
- I'm actually proud of you for trying.

50
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,018
It was brave.

51
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,561
Yeah.

52
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,771
Yay me.

53
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,858
I should have fucking killed Miguel
when I had the chance.

54
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,361
You still can, Dexter.

55
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,695
Don't give up.

56
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,549
Ow!

57
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:01,634
What is this?

58
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,177
Your bachelor party, hermano!

59
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:07,056
Ow! Ah, watch the grill, George Foreman.

60
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,685
All aboard the party boat!

61
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,317
Holy shit.
Your eye's already swollen.

62
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,402
Here he comes.

63
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,238
Ten minutes on.
Ten minutes off.

64
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,406
I'm sorry, Vince.

65
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,074
I just thought... I don't know.

66
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,744
That's fucking hilarious!
You were freaked, right?

67
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,996
Yeah.

68
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,581
Premium alcohol,
all-you-can-eat buffet,

69
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,834
plus high-class adult entertainment.

70
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,086
Kill me now.

71
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,922
You guys, this is... awesome.

72
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,049
No, no, that's fucking awesome!

73
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,093
Hey.

74
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,055
Hey, ladies, what's going on?
Hi, sailor.

75
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,646
The best man
arrives with his brother.

76
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,649
Designated driver or bodyguard?

77
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,234
I'll find out later.

78
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,570
Right now, time to put on my party face.

79
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,076
Bachelor parties.

80
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,287
While I do understand
the need for ritual,

81
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,081
I've heard these events
aren't really for the groom,

82
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,375
they're for everyone else.

83
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,631
I have plans to make for my own big day,

84
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:25,426
the day I kill Miguel.

85
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,056
OK, OK, let's get the music down.
Baja la m?sica.

86
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,392
OK, boys and girls!
Put those packages away, please.

87
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,312
So as you all know,
we're here to, uh,

88
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,690
celebrate the impending marriage
of our dear friend Dexter.

89
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:46,822
And while my job as best man
is to offer a few remarks,

90
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,450
you're gonna have to forgive me
for keeping them G-rated,

91
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,952
because, uh, I'm running for office after all.

92
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,662
Better run fast.

93
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,915
Dexter's a hard guy to get to know.

94
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,501
And for a smart guy,

95
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,754
sometimes he doesn't have the good sense
that God gave little chickens.

96
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,966
I mean, like this doughnut thing.
What's up with that?

97
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,011
You bring doughnuts to work
so that people can like you?

98
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,682
Thanks for the diabetes
and the clogged arteries, Dexter.

99
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,229
I mean, why don't you just stab
a pal in the ventricle, huh?

100
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,319
But in all seriousness, I, uh...

101
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,614
I wanna say a few words
about friendship.

102
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,409
Friends are always honest
with each other.

103
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,789
They can see past their differences.

104
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:43,212
When they have a conflict,
friends are there to forgive.

105
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:48,134
A true friend knows
when to bury the hatchet,

106
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,971
because friendship is a sacred bond...

107
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,515
built on trust.

108
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,267
And, Dex...

109
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,812
I have learned so much
from you about, uh...

110
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,065
trust.

111
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:07,945
So, co?o...

112
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,738
Hey - to Dexter!

113
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,658
To Dexter.

114
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,750
I have to be at work in 45 minutes.

115
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:25,546
Maybe I can squeeze in a power nap
and a quick shower.

116
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,425
Maybe not.

117
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,394
Hey.

118
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,104
Good morning.

119
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,940
Look, bagels. Soak up the alcohol.

120
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,235
Actually, I'm late for work.

121
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,947
How was it?

122
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,741
I... survived.

123
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,953
If you're wondering
if I did anything stupid...

124
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,163
I didn't.

125
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,625
Mmm, well,
it must have been very tempting.

126
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,336
Very.

127
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,050
Syl told me she kicked out Miguel.

128
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,511
How is he?

129
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,974
- Uh, I think he feels betrayed.
- Why?

130
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,102
He's the one who threw
his marriage vows out the window.

131
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:25,481
- Who does that?
- A man without a code.

132
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:26,565
Exactly.

133
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,275
So...

134
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,153
What?

135
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,865
Well, I mean, do you really want him
standing beside you

136
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,575
on the biggest day of our lives?

137
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,745
Actually, no.

138
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,333
But I thought I should play nice
till after the wedding.

139
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,751
Just think about it, OK?

140
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,754
- What is that?
- Oh.

141
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,340
It's a, uh, hour-by-hour schedule
for the day of.

142
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,093
There's hair and make-up for me.

143
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,346
Transportation,
pictures, ceremony.

144
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:01,517
Things are bound to go wrong.
The less left to chance the better.

145
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:02,685
Wise words.

146
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,728
- I'll make you a copy.
- Great.

147
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,939
But can we talk wedding stuff later?

148
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,234
- I really gotta get in the shower.
- You want some company?

149
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,238
Yeah. But I'm too late.

150
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,080
After last night,
they all think we share a secret,

151
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,916
but Miguel's the only one
who knows mine.

152
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,211
I could tell the rest of them,
but then I'd have to kill them.

153
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,463
Just like I'm going to kill Miguel.

154
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,220
Ow!

155
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,389
What am I,
the Morgan family punching bag?

156
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,891
Thanks for not inviting me
to Dexter's party, you ass.

157
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:46,895
It was a bachelor party.
Dongs and gongs required.

158
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,439
Unless you wanna be talent.

159
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,774
- In which case...
- Gross. He's my brother.

160
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,109
Not by blood.

161
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,320
Oh, thank God. My head.

162
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:58,866
Your head should be in the Ellen Wolf case,
Detective. Let's review.

163
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:04,246
Toby Edwards. Bartender slash booty-call.

164
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,916
Saw a black SUV outside Ellen Wolf's place
the night she died.

165
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,418
Miguel's black SUV.

166
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,879
- The grid we set up, what did we get?
- Jack diddly.

167
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,757
There's no traffic surveillance footage
of any black SUV

168
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,760
between Ellen's house and the cemetery
where her body was found.

169
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:21,013
Maybe I could kill him in his car.
It has that big back seat.

170
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,475
Let's recanvass. Somebody saw something,
and we're gonna find them.

171
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,894
Next order of business.
The Skinner.

172
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,773
George King. The Nicaraguan embassy
is still giving me the run-around.

173
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,108
Ramos. Go there in person.

174
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,403
Until we know King's true identity,
there's not much to go on.

175
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,616
And finally, Anton Briggs is coming in today
to go over his statement.

176
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,117
Today?

177
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,328
What's the matter,
you forget your lip gloss?

178
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,289
Quinn. I want you to stay clear.

179
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,957
No more sparring.

180
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,877
And, Morgan, I know he's your informant,
but I wanna cover it.

181
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,296
Get myself up to speed
with the case.

182
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,672
All right, people.

183
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,218
That's it. Go, catch bad guys.

184
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,137
Fuck you, lip gloss.

185
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,223
No unusual activity?

186
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:11,563
There was some douchebag
with his high beams on, blinding me.

187
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,235
Actually, it wasn't high beams.

188
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,570
It was those big-ass halogens.

189
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,115
- What kind of car?
- SUV.

190
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:25,244
Dark, blue... black.

191
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,496
Something like that.

192
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,152
Hola, Miguel.

193
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,321
Mmm, as?, as?.

194
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:06,076
Yeah, listen, after that scene
with Syl the other night...

195
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,329
I think we should talk.

196
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,502
That's great.

197
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,173
Get a 20 on Anton Briggs.
Have his Uni watchdogs bring him in.

198
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,134
- Hey.
- Hey.

199
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,218
Mwah.

200
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,180
- You always look so happy to see me.
- It's cause I always am.

201
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,182
I brought you these.

202
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,976
Italian hangover remedies

203
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:35,022
perfected by centuries of
overindulging ancestors.

204
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,984
There's saffron lemon risotto,
white pizza, cayenne tea.

205
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,114
Sounds great. But I'm not hung over.

206
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,576
I behaved myself last night.

207
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,620
I'm a plus one now, remember?

208
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,998
Still, man has his needs.

209
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,167
Trust me.

210
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,377
My needs are covered.

211
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,635
Cold feet?

212
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,804
What?

213
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,098
No, Rita's great.

214
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,726
Getting married's easy, Dex.

215
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,647
All you have to do is show up.

216
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,315
But killing Miguel Prado?

217
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,070
That'll require some finesse.

218
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,740
He's a public figure.

219
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,867
- Well connected.
- Dad, I got it.

220
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,119
Miguel dies, people notice.

221
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,497
Which means you can't
just make him disappear.

222
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,542
So I'll pin it on someone else.

223
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,128
How about your timeline?

224
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:43,215
Definitely after the wedding.
It'd be crazy to do it any sooner.

225
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,591
And an alibi?

226
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,426
The wedding night.

227
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,597
Rita's pregnant, exhausted.

228
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,309
After our wedding and a glass of
champagne, she'll be out like a light.

229
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,645
Unless she wakes up
and you're not there.

230
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,856
That is not the way you want her
to remember your wedding night.

231
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,030
Are you hiding or something?

232
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,826
Anton will be here in a minute.
I don't wanna see him.

233
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:14,830
I know it's real immature,
but if I see him, I'll just miss him.

234
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,166
So tell him.

235
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,002
I can't.

236
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,005
I need to be with somebody
who's got his shit together.

237
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,174
Somebody with a real job,
somebody with strong morals.

238
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,927
Somebody like Dad.

239
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,347
Dad wasn't perfect, Deb.

240
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,059
Yeah, well,
he wasn't a drug user or a CI.

241
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,894
Well, Anton's not a CI.

242
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:42,357
Dad still wouldn't approve.

243
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,484
You'd be surprised.

244
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,990
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

245
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,283
Something.

246
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,828
You've had a bug up your ass
about Dad for months now.

247
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,121
What did he do?

248
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,960
You don't wanna know.

249
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,756
Now I really do.

250
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,094
He wasn't on the take.

251
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,306
He didn't break any laws.
He didn't cheat on Mom.

252
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,406
Bullshit.

253
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,618
Yeah, you're right.

254
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,539
Bullshit! Who?

255
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,549
A CI.

256
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,724
You always wanted to be like Dad.

257
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,896
Seriously?

258
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:18,453
Anton is here to go over his statement...
with you.

259
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,540
- I thought you were covering this.
- I was.

260
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,085
But you're the only one he trusts.

261
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,131
Well, it's really hard to find people
that you trust these days.

262
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,882
- Deb...
- Blow me.

263
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,429
My sister never says that.

264
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,313
Oops.

265
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:10,255
Shit, this was a bad idea.
Send in the other guy.

266
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,842
What?

267
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,053
It's pretty clear
you don't wanna be here.

268
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,766
I'm... Sorry, this is not about you. Um...

269
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:26,730
I mean, it's about you. It's just...

270
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,859
...something else just happened.

271
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,905
Are you OK?

272
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,157
No.

273
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,410
Can I help?

274
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,537
Um...

275
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:48,126
Take a look at this and see if there's
anything that you wanna change or add...

276
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,796
You know that's not why I'm here.

277
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,758
Right now I really need it to be.

278
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,613
What?

279
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,618
Is there a mistake?

280
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,080
No.

281
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,082
It's just, um...

282
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:31,962
these... words, they don't... really say it.

283
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,383
You know, what... what happened to me.

284
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,344
What do you mean?

285
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,890
Debra, I could...

286
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,227
hear it, you know?

287
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,606
The sound...

288
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,777
of the blade cutting into me.

289
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,283
That and, uh...

290
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,910
the sound of me screaming.

291
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,498
Like it was somebody else.

292
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,087
And I remember thinking,

293
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,590
"That guy screaming...

294
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,763
"he's gonna die. "

295
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,610
But, um...

296
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,654
then he just stopped.

297
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,115
Why?

298
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,994
To go through my pockets.

299
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,830
He took my wallet
and my cell phone.

300
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,082
Cocksucker even took my change.

301
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,461
Your change?

302
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,174
How fucked up is that?

303
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,528
He give you anything?

304
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,197
Nothing we can use.

305
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,200
We'll walk the crime scene,
see if there's anything we missed.

306
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,994
Whatever it takes
to fucking catch this guy.

307
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,500
Please tell me
you're not freezing sperm in there.

308
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,630
This only gets down
to minus 40 degrees centigrade.

309
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:42,092
Freezing sperm requires a vessel
to be at least minus 200.

310
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,845
What? I'm a donor.

311
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,806
It's my way of giving back.

312
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,307
God help the children.

313
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:53,395
Hey, um, is the, uh, server down?

314
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:57,232
- Why, what do you need?
- Um, I wanted to run a background check.

315
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,608
On who?

316
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,694
Tammy Okama.

317
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,905
You slept with her, didn't you?

318
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,366
Vince Masuka does not kiss and tell.

319
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,078
OK, fine, I banged her.

320
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,289
- And?
- And...

321
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,793
Wow. We just stayed up all night just...

322
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,295
just talking.

323
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,048
So you like her?

324
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:25,844
The problem is she likes me.

325
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,471
I mean, there's gotta be
something wrong with her, right?

326
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,516
Well, I'll let you know
when the server's up.

327
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,281
If home is where the heart is,

328
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,658
where do you go
when you don't have a heart?

329
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,288
In Miguel's case, a five-star hotel.

330
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,375
I used to know Miguel's schedule
inside and out.

331
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,544
After all, we were best friends.

332
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,297
But things change.

333
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,340
Now that Syl kicked him
out of the house,

334
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,551
he has a new routine I need to learn.

335
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,235
Can I get my keys?
I forgot something.

336
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,987
- There you are, Mr. Prado.
- Thank you.

337
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,989
Thank you.

338
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,701
Or I could wait for him
to do something stupid.

339
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,244
Like ditching Ramon.

340
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,468
You close to your father?

341
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,890
No. He was, uh, deadbeat trailer trash.

342
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:57,393
- It's why I became a cop.
- You got a rich mother or something?

343
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,104
She died when I was five.

344
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,230
Why?

345
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,857
The car, the watch.

346
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,026
Just wondering
if you had a trust fund,

347
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:09,864
- or you were day trading, or something.
- No. I got an uncle in Boston.

348
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,034
He died, left me a building. Total surprise.

349
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,661
Huh.

350
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,371
Families are full of 'em.

351
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:19,791
Just wait till Dexter's wedding.
Brings out the best and the worst.

352
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,671
Weddings kinda suck
when you're single.

353
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,715
Single? I thought you and Anton were...

354
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,425
- We're not. Not anymore.
- Hmm.

355
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,595
So, uh...

356
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,889
you wanna, you know, carpool?

357
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:38,935
What?

358
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,312
High gas prices, you know?

359
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,274
Are you hitting on me?

360
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,441
I'm sorry.

361
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,238
Hello?

362
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,614
- Morgan.
- Hello?

363
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,700
Hello?

364
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,369
Goddamn it,
fucking cell phone reception.

365
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,497
It's Batista.

366
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,458
Probably wants a status update.
We should give it to him.

367
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,961
Hey, you have any change?
I saw a payphone up the street.

368
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,296
Think so.

369
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,428
Motherfuck!

370
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,263
Holy Jesus on a stick!

371
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,182
- What?
- No cell phone reception.

372
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:20,852
That's why George King took
Anton's change. To use that payphone.

373
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,813
We gotta dump the phone records.

374
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,775
Whoa.

375
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,862
Oye.

376
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,697
Si.

377
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,033
I'm glad you called today.

378
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,286
I was surprised, but, uh, glad.

379
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:44,918
The last thing I wanted to do
was put you in the middle of...

380
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,379
Maria, you gotta know that...

381
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,716
I've been thinking about us for a long time.

382
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:55,803
Way before Ellen Wolf, rest in peace.

383
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,977
- Cause, hey, what we had...
- We were different back then.

384
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,646
Really different.

385
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,274
So why is it every time I look at you,

386
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,195
I still feel the same way I felt
when we first met? Hmm?

387
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,492
- Water's boiling.
- Boiling, yes, ooh.

388
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,828
It's mi sopa.

389
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:23,998
And... I got you some Red Stripe.

390
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,335
- Oh, wow, great.
- Somewhere. Shit, I left it in the car.

391
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:28,920
Oh, I'll go get it.

392
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:32,924
No, no, no, no. You stay
and make sure it doesn't boil over.

393
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,343
OK.

394
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,376
Miguel probably thinks
he's getting lucky.

395
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,878
Looks like he's getting screwed.

396
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:50,084
They make a cute couple. Too bad
they're both lying through their teeth.

397
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:29,332
Don't go there, Miguel.
You start thinking LaGuerta's onto you,

398
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:33,294
you'll decide to do very bad things
to another innocent person,

399
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,297
and I can't let that happen.

400
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,228
Things to do today -

401
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,606
find a non-blowback way
to dispose Miguel's body.

402
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:05,284
I need you to run hair and fiber for me
against all victims for the last ten days.

403
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:10,206
- But I'm the blood guy.
- Who also does forensics.

404
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:13,668
Who I trust to keep a confidence
and the lab results off the record.

405
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,004
Well, keeping secrets
is one of my strong suits,

406
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:20,675
but I got my head handed to me the last time
I did some off-the-grid testing, by you.

407
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,970
This is different.
That was bureaucratic bullshit.

408
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,806
And this is,
"Do as I say, not as I do"?

409
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,436
You ever get a voice inside
nagging at you?

410
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:36,691
- I'm aware of the phenomenon.
- Well, I'm hoping I'm wrong about this,

411
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,776
but if I am and anyone finds out,

412
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,529
it'll bring a shit hurricane
down on the entire department.

413
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,197
And if you're right?

414
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,867
Same hurricane, different landfall.

415
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,786
Got it. Either way, I need a raincoat.

416
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,205
No, I don't want you getting
into any trouble over this.

417
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:55,751
Use my authorization code to make it
happen. Procedure above board, results...

418
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,005
under the table.

419
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,883
- You good with that?
- Absolutely.

420
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,343
If you need something
under the table, I'm your guy.

421
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,556
That didn't come out right.

422
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:12,477
How soon before you can get back to me
with this?

423
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,604
ASAP.

424
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:22,612
Accessing samples from homicides
in the last ten days.

425
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,700
Fast-tracked and confidential.

426
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,911
Authorization code requested.

427
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,003
Processing.

428
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,464
Approved.

429
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,967
You're the best.

430
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,598
I have to be.

431
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:35,893
MUDs and LUDs from that payphone.
George King was using it like an office line.

432
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:39,105
He called clients, he called workers,
he ordered Nicaraguan takeout.

433
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,816
- That doesn't help us.
- Well, maybe it does.

434
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,860
I just got off the phone with some lady
that he called up in New Jersey.

435
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:46,779
She winters down here
at Coconut Grove.

436
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,574
She just rehired George King
to re-landscape their lawn.

437
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,702
- So?
- So he knows the place is empty.

438
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:57,123
- You think he'd be using it to lay low?
- We got fuck-all else.

439
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,751
Vince.

440
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,964
The server's back up,
so I ran your girl.

441
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,800
Bad news. She's got a rap sheet.

442
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,805
She rammed her car into someone else
over a parking space.

443
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,809
- Yeah.
- Big fine, anger management.

444
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,229
That means she's got issues.

445
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,231
So she's not outta my league.

446
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,195
Happy to help.

447
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:38,497
Both Caucasoid, evenly distributed
pigment granules, same dye job.

448
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,417
In other words, both Ellen Wolf.
No news there.

449
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:45,963
Do I let LaGuerta in on this?

450
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,174
But why stir up the hornet's nest?

451
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,761
Miguel's going to get the justice
he deserves soon enough.

452
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,555
- Hey, Dex.
- Hey.

453
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,224
Too late to bring a date
to the wedding?

454
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:00,686
No, Rita's still collecting RSVPs.

455
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,564
What you working on?

456
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,735
I, uh, found a grey hair.
I was curious.

457
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,945
Oh, dude, I've totally done that.

458
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,198
You're bald.

459
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,035
Oh.

460
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:48,693
- Maybe we should call for backup?
- Let's see what we got first.

461
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,659
Someone took the jungle cruise
at Magic Kingdom.

462
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,333
Creeping mother of Mary!

463
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,294
Hey.

464
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,880
Door.

465
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,549
Fuck, there he is!

466
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,384
Go around front.

467
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,097
Requesting all units, 931 Harbor Drive.

468
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,655
Fuck!

469
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:37,783
Fuck!

470
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,120
- Jesus, Quinn, are you OK?
- Ow!

471
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,666
Officer down.
931 Harbor Drive.

472
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:49,253
Requesting an ambulance,
Also air surveillance of our 20.

473
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,718
What's this?

474
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,512
Dexter, I need to see you for a minute.

475
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:11,901
- You found the hair analysis results?
- Sorry, it...

476
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,945
You were out, and they were
just sitting there,

477
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,698
and I really needed to know
what came back.

478
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,038
So... now you know.

479
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,248
Question is,
what are you gonna do?

480
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,503
It's complicated.

481
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,423
I understand complicated.
Maybe I can help.

482
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,054
OK.

483
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,933
You're close with Miguel Prado,
and so am I,

484
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,393
which is what makes this very difficult.

485
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,188
What's this gotta do with Miguel?

486
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,484
Ellen Wolf was threatening
to wreck his career.

487
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:58,155
Well, he has a black SUV
and no alibi for the night she died.

488
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,409
You think Miguel had something
to do with her murder?

489
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:07,122
I found this sample in the back of his car.

490
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:14,046
I... I told you this was complicated.

491
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,298
Dexter.

492
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,552
I need your word this stays between us.

493
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,554
Yeah, you have it.

494
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:26,308
No wonder all the secrecy.

495
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,854
I'm assuming there's no chain of custody
on this?

496
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,566
I'll go to a judge for a warrant,
get evidence through proper channels.

497
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:37,778
Which will tip off Miguel
and put LaGuerta in his crosshairs.

498
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,030
You really think a judge
is gonna issue a warrant

499
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,909
against a well-respected officer of the court
without probable cause?

500
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,828
I don't know, Dexter.

501
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,080
I... I can't do nothing.

502
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,957
Not after these results.

503
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:53,586
Maybe you could sit on it.

504
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,548
For a while. Let Miguel think...

505
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,550
he got away with murder.

506
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,930
It'd give you time to build a solid case.

507
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,187
I've got some serious
soul-searching to do.

508
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,024
Take as long as you need.

509
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,984
Thanks for your help, Dexter.

510
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,611
Yeah.

511
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:25,701
While LaGuerta's deciding,
I'll be eliminating her problem.

512
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:29,622
And George King's going to help me.
I'll copy his MO.

513
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,540
They won't even look for another suspect.

514
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,125
What happened?

515
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,376
King.

516
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:38,797
I told him to go home, but he's hell-bent
on proving he has cojones of steel.

517
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,384
- You good?
- Superficial cut. Let's keep moving.

518
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,638
All right, get me your report
as soon as you can.

519
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,474
The brass is gonna be asking questions.

520
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,603
We had aerial surveillance,
a security perimeter, at least 50 officers.

521
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,730
It's like George King is a ghost.

522
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,815
Sorry, Sarge.

523
00:37:56,942 --> 00:38:01,904
I'm not. I need King out there long enough
to peg Miguel's murder on him.

524
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,864
How long have you known?

525
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,366
Huh?

526
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,868
About Dad and his CI.

527
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,166
Uh... couple of weeks.

528
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:18,295
Camilla told me right before she died.

529
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,382
- I didn't know if I should...
- Tell me?

530
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,884
Yes, whenever you have
an earth-shattering, ball-crushing,

531
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,012
mind-fuck of a secret,
you should tell your fucking sister.

532
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,683
Sorry.

533
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,230
You can get that now.

534
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:42,194
Rita wants to know
if you're bringing Anton to the wedding.

535
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,156
Bad timing.

536
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,078
No, I'm not bringing him.

537
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:56,500
Quinn sort of asked
if I would go as his date, but...

538
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,713
as much as I'll hate going stag
to my own brother's wedding...

539
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,508
being Quinn's date
depresses me even more.

540
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,885
He seems OK.

541
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,431
Yeah, he's fine.

542
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,599
On paper he's a cop.

543
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,561
Good career.

544
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:16,854
Like Dad.

545
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,355
Yeah.

546
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:22,901
Well, it seems I don't know Dad
as well as I thought I did.

547
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,987
Turns out I'm just as big
a fuck-up as he was.

548
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,698
You're not a fuck-up!

549
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:32,036
You're the hardest-working person I know,
you're loyal to a fault.

550
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:35,789
In all the years I've known you,
you've never let me down.

551
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,129
You should be my best man.

552
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,257
What?

553
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,135
Miguel is your best man.

554
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:51,930
He's not even a good man.
I shoulda asked you in the first place.

555
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,807
So why didn't you?

556
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,601
I don't know. I...

557
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,020
thought the best man
was supposed to be a man.

558
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,857
But I trust you...

559
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,734
more than anyone.

560
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:07,321
That's way more important.

561
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:11,408
You better not be doing this
because you feel guilty.

562
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,285
Would you just...

563
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,370
stand up for me?

564
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:21,210
Abso-fucking-lutely.

565
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,257
Hey!

566
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,593
Long time.

567
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:33,305
Too busy with that new boyfriend of yours
to come down and talk shit with me?

568
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,765
What? Word travels.

569
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,975
Well, not fast enough.
We broke up.

570
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,019
Hey, fuck him. His loss.

571
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,230
Yeah, well...

572
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,816
I kinda need a favor.

573
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,609
That's what I'm here for.
What you need?

574
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:48,862
All the records you have
on my dad's confidential informants.

575
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,030
Your dad?

576
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,490
I know it's a big dig,

577
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:56,495
but I just need the female Cls,
and probably just the attractive ones.

578
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,498
Someone said something to you...

579
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,167
about Harry and one of his Cls?

580
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,586
His attractive female Cls?

581
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,296
Why, you know something?

582
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:11,301
What I know is, your dad wouldn't be
the first cop to fuck around on his wife.

583
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,679
Look, I know you have
a lot of requests, but...

584
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:17,141
But nothing.
My dad stepped out on my mom.

585
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:18,976
Woulda cut off his dick if I coulda.

586
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,564
- I'll put a rush on it.
- Thank you.

587
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,160
Miguel's a night owl
and a newly minted bachelor,

588
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,370
no way he's in bed this early.

589
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,083
Are you kidding me?
I'm not going to sleep.

590
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,423
The way the Prados
are knocking them back,

591
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:53,927
they're not going anywhere soon.
Just as well, I have some stalking to do.

592
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,679
Hotel Belvedere.

593
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,765
- Miguel Prado, please.
- Yes, sir. I'll connect you right away.

594
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,487
Got it.

595
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:20,454
Excuse me.

596
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,290
- Si?
- Could I get a turndown service?

597
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,000
- Room 138.
- Mm-hm.

598
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,212
Thanks.

599
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,137
Hello?

600
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,306
Yeah.

601
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:41,600
I- I'm sorry,
you're breaking up.

602
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,852
Can I call you back on a landline?

603
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,395
OK, bye.

604
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,397
I'm sorry, that's my boss.

605
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,066
Can you come back later?

606
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,192
Oh, s?.

607
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,653
- Gracias.
- De nada, se?or.

608
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:04,706
I can park right there, use this
as my point of entry and make the grab.

609
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,792
I'm in and out undetected.

610
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,424
A life vest? Shit.

611
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:18,512
He's been back to that hardware store.
He's planning to kill again.

612
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:30,565
Fucking Miguel and his innocent victims.
That's why he's at the bar.

613
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:34,861
Get Ramon blackout drunk so Miguel
can claim he was here the whole time.

614
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,614
Tonight's the night.

615
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:14,609
Maria?

616
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,526
Lieutenant, Dexter here. Hey, I came across
something you'll be interested in.

617
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,738
Kinda has to do with the whole
Miguel Prado, Ellen Wolf thing

618
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:02,240
you wanted me to look at.
You there?

619
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:03,784
We should meet.

620
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,454
I'll be at the Rising Moon Caf?
at 91st and Channel at 8pm.

621
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,331
Uh... I'll try your cell.

622
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,647
Jesus!

623
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,273
Finally.

624
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,662
No, no, no, no, man.

625
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,457
Oh, God.

626
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,672
Maria.

627
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:00,674
Oh.

628
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,222
OK.

629
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:09,141
OK, OK, I know...

630
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,017
I know I...

631
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:14,688
I crossed the line here.
I know that now.

632
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,567
It doesn't have to come to this.

633
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,902
But it always does.

634
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:24,656
I had higher hopes for you, for us.

635
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:31,079
But I finally just have to accept it,
I'll always be alone.

636
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,539
That's not true.

637
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,250
You talking truth? That's good.

638
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:40,547
You actually had me believing
I could have a friend...

639
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:44,426
cause I swallowed your bullshit.

640
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:46,094
It wasn't bullshit!

641
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,471
Shh.

642
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,268
I tried.

643
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,856
I tried to crack that damn armor of yours.

644
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,027
Because I saw the possibility.

645
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,112
I still see the possibilities.

646
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,698
So this is my fault
for being a shutdown?

647
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,909
No, I just want you to let me in!

648
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,454
Why the fuck would I do that now?

649
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,708
Because I know you.

650
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,252
Dexter, I know you better than anyone else.

651
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:23,048
No, there've been quite a few
who've seen the real me as they...

652
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,259
laid on that table.

653
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,220
You're all just...

654
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:30,889
unchecked versions of myself...

655
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,601
what I would have become
without my father's code.

656
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,645
They deserved it!

657
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,813
I'm not like them!

658
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,190
You are.

659
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,358
Admit it.

660
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,737
- I'm like you.
- No. No. No, no, no, no.

661
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,406
I know I'm a monster.

662
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:50,909
I accept you.

663
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:57,707
I accept you, Dexter, like a brother.

664
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:00,293
I killed my brother.

665
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:07,467
I killed yours too.

666
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:14,641
Oscar?

667
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:17,852
You?

668
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:21,481
I didn't plan to,
but it was kill or be killed.

669
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,692
You!

670
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:27,237
You killed Oscar!

671
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,406
What did you say...

672
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,325
in your bachelor party speech?

673
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:36,079
Friends are always honest.

674
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:40,500
Friends forgive.

675
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:45,213
Friends forgive.

676
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:49,009
But I don't forgive you.

677
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,729
And I don't get to have friends.

678
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:07,402
You little freak!

679
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,279
You think I'm done with you?

680
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,364
You think this ends here?

681
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,741
It doesn't!

682
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,784
It does for you.

683
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:42,228
Adi?s, amigo.
