1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,002
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,212
This child is happening.

3
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:09,467
I'm going to have a child.
But I can't be a father to it. Can I?

4
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:10,718
The Oscar Prado case?

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:15,306
Fuckers are on the career-maker of the year.
Nail this Freebo and they're golden.

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,517
This time he killed a senior ADA's brother.

7
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,645
Except he didn't kill Oscar. I did.

8
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,563
- What do you have on Freebo, Maria?
- Ramon.

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,401
- Well, we're working on some new angles.
- Which means you've got shit.

10
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,195
This doesn't look good, Javier.
I think you fucked a girl who's now dead.

11
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,489
All right, look. I passed her to a friend

12
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,408
- who could feed her habit...
- A friend?

13
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:37,036
- Yeah, a white guy named Freebo.
- Freebo?

14
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,122
Why do you think
Freebo's still in town?

15
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:42,834
Because I think he killed his girlfriend
on Sunday. Jane Doe.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,919
Wasn't Jane Doe
missing a patch of skin?

17
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,547
Freebo's still out there killing.
We got to catch him fast.

18
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,090
Yeah, but we got a lead now.

19
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,926
This department is
becoming annoyingly effective.

20
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,721
Anton is my contact.

21
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:59,142
- If you wear him out or blow his cover...
- I know how to work a CI, Quinn.

22
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:03,020
So unless there's some other reason
you don't want me to talk to him...

23
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:04,856
I can get you a shield tomorrow.

24
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:11,112
- Will you get me a shield for being a rat?
- No. For being an honest cop, Debra.

25
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,281
Like your father.

26
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,160
I know all about the Chicky Hines case.
He was a big one for the prosecutor.

27
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,787
- And guess who that was?
- Shit.

28
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,622
Miguel Prado.

29
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:25,376
M-6 bayonet.
Oscar tried to kill Freebo with it.

30
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,045
It's only fitting I use it to complete the task.

31
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,844
It was self-defense.

32
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,892
Thank you.

33
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,019
You're welcome.

34
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,978
The grocery store. The modern-day
equivalent of the Serengeti,

35
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,314
where the mighty lion goes to hunt.

36
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,527
And my weaker brethren
reward me with gifts.

37
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,238
Hmm!

38
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,658
We'll be needing a lot of those pretty soon.

39
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,745
The lioness, of course,
has her own agenda.

40
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:10,041
- What's next?
- Uh...

41
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,668
Macaroni & Cheese. Mayonnaise.

42
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,965
You do your grocery list alphabetically?

43
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,009
How else would you do it?

44
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,596
Got it.

45
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:27,642
Mmm! The rare and elusive White Cheddar.
Very good choice.

46
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,977
Let's go find some muffins.

47
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:34,106
What you wanna be? A painter?
I don't know...

48
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,401
I bet you're a good drawer. A sculptor...

49
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:42,281
My highly tuned senses detect another
predator sniffing around one of my cubs.

50
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,033
- D'you get the mayo?
- Yep.

51
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,417
He wanted to know where the Cheerios are.

52
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,213
Aisle three. Other side of the store.

53
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,715
Oh... Thanks.

54
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,725
All right. What's next?

55
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,143
Zucchini.

56
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,842
Just in case.

57
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,518
FQ.

58
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,355
Forensics Quarterly.

59
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,696
Forensics Quarterly.
With an article written by yours truly.

60
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,449
Good stuff. Very sexy.

61
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:12,038
"Simultaneous quantification
of autosomal and Y-chromosomal DNA"?

62
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:17,084
Yeah, I autographed it but if you want me
to write something personal, let me know.

63
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,878
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

64
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,093
No match on her prints.
No missing persons report.

65
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,804
- So Jane Doe...
- Is still Jane Doe.

66
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,264
And Freebo?

67
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,266
Same thing, nothing.

68
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:42,276
Sugar is so much better
than the artificial stuff. Don't you think?

69
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,903
Well, I guess.

70
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,615
- Do you like milk or cream?
- Neither.

71
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,785
- Not exactly the chatty type, are you?
- No.

72
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,418
Quinn, Morgan.
Man the phones. Man the streets.

73
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:03,130
Someone out there's seen Freebo
and we haven't found him yet. Let's go.

74
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:08,135
Miguel Prado - the only living person
who's seen me with blood on my hands.

75
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,637
- Miguel.
- Maria.

76
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,014
Hey. How are you holding up?

77
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,811
I can't lie. I'm missing
my little brother every minute of every day.

78
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:21,524
Well, it'll get easier.
It's a clich? but it's true.

79
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,153
I want to thank you for making
Dexter Morgan available to me. He, uh...

80
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,158
He went to great trouble
to help me... understand...

81
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,494
how Oscar's last moments unfolded.

82
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,955
Why is he trying so hard
to be my friend?

83
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,083
We're doing everything we can
to find the man who killed Oscar.

84
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:43,838
I know you are. That's why I feel
like I'm in such a difficult situation.

85
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,298
What is that?

86
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:50,678
Well, you've dedicated so many
of your resources towards resolving this...

87
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,847
He's trying to end the investigation.

88
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,851
Is it worth it? We both know if you
don't catch a perp in the first 48 hours,

89
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,478
the chances significantly drop
that you ever will.

90
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,524
Miguel, this is not the time to give up
or even slow down.

91
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,862
We will find Fred Bowman.
We'll bring him to justice.

92
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,321
Thank you, Maria.

93
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,828
Psst! Tonight...

94
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,580
Viernes Culturales.

95
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:21,959
Come by the beach, grab a beer,
uh... medianoche. Right after work.

96
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,212
- You'll be home by eight.
- I don't know if Rita will be up for it.

97
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,841
Syl already talked to her.
She'd love to go.

98
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,136
Then Viernes Culturales it is.

99
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,770
Did he say anything
about the Chicky Hines situation?

100
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,607
I still got a witness in lockup
that says Hines is innocent.

101
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,650
- Miguel is aware of that.
- I know.

102
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,821
I was just wondering when he's finally going
to get around to questioning my witness?

103
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,700
- I assumed he had already.
- Not as of this morning.

104
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,870
Well, I'm sure he'll get to it.

105
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,040
I'll talk to him.

106
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,461
We got a new murder victim.
Dumped in the park just like our Jane Doe.

107
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,714
Some of his skin was sliced off.
Looks like Freebo struck again.

108
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,093
- All right. Let's get there.
- It can't be Freebo. I killed him.

109
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,973
But only Miguel and I know that.

110
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,649
And we're not at liberty to tell.

111
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,333
Javier Garza, he's a lowlife pimp.

112
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,752
He's the one that connected
our Jane Doe to Freebo.

113
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,338
Looks like Freebo paid him back for that.

114
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,174
I can't say for certain
until I get this under the 'scope,

115
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,928
but I'm guessing we're looking
at something like an eight-inch blade,

116
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,097
razor-sharp, single-edged.

117
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:01,308
Same type of instrument
used on our Jane Doe.

118
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,768
So Freebo killed Javier.

119
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,687
No, he didn't kill Javier.

120
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:09,108
One of the tree-trimmers called it in, said
he didn't see anything or anyone unusual.

121
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,484
It all points to Freebo.

122
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,488
- He got a little hungry for flesh this time.
- What the hell's that about?

123
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,740
Do we think he's eating it?

124
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,869
There's a lot more cannibalism
in this country than any of you realize.

125
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,414
Maybe the skin's like a trophy or something.

126
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,001
Or he just likes to hurt people.
What do you think, Dex?

127
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,546
- They all sound like good theories to me.
- Way to commit.

128
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:35,009
So far we haven't found shit on Freebo
but now he's giving us a second chance.

129
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,221
So let's not blow it. Quinn, Morgan,
let's get a canvass going. One-block perimeter.

130
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,975
- Start with the tree-trimmers.
- Why don't you take the tree-trimmers?

131
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,936
- I'm going to start over here.
- Oh, gosh. I wonder why.

132
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,736
Hey! Can you come down here?

133
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,865
Sure.

134
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,496
Hi. I'm Detective Joseph Quinn.

135
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,374
There's nothing to worry about here.
Did you guys see anything?

136
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,835
How long have you been out here?
Been out here a while?

137
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,254
- What's your name?
- George Washington King.

138
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,715
- And you called this in?
- Yes, I did.

139
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,052
- You found the body?
- Uh... No, no. Mario did.

140
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,305
- Will you join us, please?
- Ven aqui.

141
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,683
Mario, did you notice anyone else?

142
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,187
Keep my eyes on my work.

143
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,440
I got to go with Freebo on this one.

144
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,735
Means he's stepping out
from wherever he's been hiding.

145
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,237
Not so good for our latest victim
but good for us.

146
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,655
Yeah.

147
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,949
- Yeah.
- Hey, Dex.

148
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,369
Let's grab a beer tonight,
talk about my Jane Doe.

149
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,955
I'd like to help but I have
too much to deal with right now.

150
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,166
What do you have to deal with?

151
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,667
Rita's pregnant.

152
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,754
Say again?

153
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,590
Rita's pregnant.

154
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,966
You're lying!

155
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,011
- I'm not lying.
- A baby?

156
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:06,600
A motherfucking roly-poly, chubby-cheeked
shit-machine? Are you kidding me?

157
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:11,522
Well, I've never heard it described
in quite those words before, but yeah.

158
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,441
That's so great!

159
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,654
I'm so happy for you guys.

160
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,950
Well, thank you.

161
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,285
Hmm... Baby on board.

162
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,162
I've got to get on board.

163
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,583
Grab a sweater. It'll get cool later.

164
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,589
Mm.

165
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,260
You OK?

166
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,721
I always get my morning sickness
late in the day.

167
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,391
You want to stay home?
We don't have to go.

168
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,936
- No.
- The Prados will understand.

169
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:56,525
No. I was looking forward to seeing Syl.
I know you love hanging out with Miguel.

170
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,111
Miguel. My new bestest friend.

171
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:02,990
Besides, the doctor says
the way I'm feeling is fine.

172
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,702
What else did the doctor say?

173
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:10,330
He asked me a million questions
about my medical history.

174
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:14,251
There's a form for you to fill out too,
but I told him you were adopted.

175
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,796
I mean...
Are there any details that you do know?

176
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,508
Like "Mom was killed by a chainsaw,
my brother was killed by...

177
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,177
"well, me. " That kind of stuff?

178
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,304
No, I don't really know anything.

179
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,308
Well, it's OK.

180
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,937
I could go to the doctor
and get checked out, if you want.

181
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,192
- You'd do that?
- Of course.

182
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,861
I'm glad we're in this together, Dexter.

183
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,030
You'll make a good father.

184
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,032
You know, if you want to.

185
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,930
- Here. It'll help settle your stomach.
- Thank you.

186
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,475
- How are you doing with everything else?
- Good.

187
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,685
I feel better about it now.

188
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:18,357
- Actually kind of excited.
- Good. And Dexter?

189
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:23,654
Mm. I think he's still
a little overwhelmed by everything.

190
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,073
Ugh! Men, they're such babies.

191
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,952
They need to be carried
kicking and screaming into fatherhood.

192
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,413
I guess they're just scared
about losing their freedom.

193
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:39,920
Dexter. I don't know if you officially
got to meet my other brother, Ramon.

194
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,922
Beautiful wife, Sara.

195
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,216
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

196
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:49,054
- Sheriff's department, right?
- That's right.

197
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,974
So you're the guy that Miguel
is always talking about?

198
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,769
- Oh?
- Oh, don't worry. Like they say, it's all good.

199
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,230
Yeah, if good means being part of the team

200
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:01,525
that's never going to catch
our brother's murderer.

201
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:05,237
My gracious brother.
We'll grab a beer?

202
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,451
- Gracias, mi amigo.
- Para servir.

203
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,831
Free beer. Must be nice to be you.

204
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:19,501
A lot of people appreciate
knowing that I'm on their side.

205
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,506
I understand you're soon to be a father.

206
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,719
Yeah.

207
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,887
What?
Some mixed emotions there?

208
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,600
No. It's just...

209
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,019
Yeah, mixed emotions.

210
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:41,023
I don't know what's more complicated,
having a father or being one but...

211
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,859
it's good to know you're not taking it lightly.

212
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,447
- You'll see your way through it.
- Hope so.

213
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,825
So, uh... our friend Freebo...

214
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,914
...has he come back from the dead
or are the police mistaken?

215
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,334
I'd venture to guess the police are mistaken.

216
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,336
You're positive?

217
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,880
Miguel, he's dead.

218
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,301
I believe you.

219
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,303
Well, good.

220
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,764
You just, uh, seem a little...

221
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,974
C?mo anda, chiquitico?

222
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,687
You seem a little unsettled
with the whole thing.

223
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,607
That's what he's looking for.
A sign that I'm normal.

224
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,818
To be honest,
I haven't been sleeping too well lately.

225
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,237
Just know you did the right thing, my friend.

226
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,992
And it will never be forgotten.

227
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,335
A full day of work,
an evening of socializing,

228
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:49,591
and now, finally,
the calm, cool aloneness of my apartment.

229
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:57,474
Hello, Nathan Marten, Cheerios man.

230
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,695
My animal instincts are never wrong.

231
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,074
Hello, Nathan Marten, sexual predator.

232
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,578
You did four years
at South Bay Correctional Facility.

233
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,207
Your official status is "released".

234
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,419
Which leaves you free
to slither about the earth.

235
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,270
- Miguel.
- I went back to my office

236
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:47,149
to finish up with some paperwork,
and it just... it kept on nagging at me.

237
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,695
?Co?o! What Ramon said to you.
I wanted to apologize.

238
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,530
It's really not necessary.

239
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,867
At least share a drink with me.

240
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,412
Yeah, I'll grab some glasses.

241
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:05,792
Showing up late at night like this,
is it creepy, or just what friends do?

242
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,630
How 'bout out here?

243
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:16,636
My father, he caught me drinking
from his bottle of rum when I was, like, 12.

244
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,182
- Yeah.
- He grabbed that bottle, he threw it at me.

245
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,310
Eight stitches,
right in the back of my head right there.

246
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,770
Ouch.

247
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,981
He was a college professor back in Cuba.

248
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,777
Once he got married
and had a couple of kids, he realized,

249
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,945
time to get away from Castro's world.

250
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,491
So we came over on one of these
old fishing boats. I was, like, five.

251
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:42,162
Dexter. The boat actually sank
50 yards from the shore!

252
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,791
My mother had to grab Ramon, my father
grabbed me and they swam to the shore.

253
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,585
- Wet foot, dry foot.
- Sounds brave.

254
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,296
Yeah.

255
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,174
Yeah, he was a real hero, my father was.

256
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,762
He spent the rest of his life telling everybody
what a great man he could have been

257
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,555
if it wasn't for Castro.

258
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,724
The more he drank, the greater he became.

259
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,100
Ah.

260
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,523
I would look at him and tell myself,
"I'm not going to be like him. "

261
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,113
You succeeded.

262
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,199
Yes, I did.

263
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:23,995
You know what the funny thing is?
In his eyes, I was a failure.

264
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,249
I could never measure up!

265
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,214
My father was disgusted by me.

266
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,009
Disgusted?

267
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,222
Well, no offence to the dead,
but your father was an idiot.

268
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:50,063
Never said that to anyone before.
Not Rita. Not to my sister.

269
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,483
Yeah, yeah, but, Dexter,
they wouldn't understand.

270
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:58,530
You know? They don't know what it is to be a
man, to be a son. All that fuckin' pressure.

271
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,326
You can grow up and be exactly the man
your father molded you to be, and still...

272
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,911
Not be good enough!

273
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,080
Exactly.

274
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,049
It was even harder on Oscar.

275
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,597
By the time he was born
my father was hardly even around.

276
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,893
I mean, I tried to take care of him,
look after... You know.

277
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,520
I'm sorry.

278
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,063
That I killed him.

279
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,733
To Oscar.

280
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,319
To Oscar.

281
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,456
So, Dexter...

282
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,292
I think I have an answer
for our other little problem.

283
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:57,005
- Oh?
- Yes, I think I got it all figured out.

284
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:01,968
All we have to do is get Freebo's body,
we dump it, then I can call Ramon,

285
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:07,599
tell him that I received an anonymous tip
about where Freebo can be found.

286
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:11,102
That would close the case.
And we can all put it behind us.

287
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:16,107
- Sorry, it's not possible.
- Of course it is. I'll help.

288
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,402
Miguel, the body is... gone.

289
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,655
I'll get it. Just tell me where it is.

290
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:25,158
He's not going to give up.
He needs to see something.

291
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,660
I'll take you there.

292
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,288
Tomorrow. Huh? Lunch time.

293
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,291
- OK.
- I'll pick you up.

294
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,963
But look, Dexter, you're not
in this alone, huh? It's you and me.

295
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,384
Together.

296
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:51,559
That's the problem.
This whole "together" thing.

297
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,565
- Hey, stranger.
- Shit.

298
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:03,279
It's one thing for you to come to the club,
but don't track me down all over the place.

299
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:04,531
I called you three times.

300
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:08,535
If you'd bothered to return those calls,
you could have picked the location.

301
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,287
No, I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way.

302
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,210
Shit!

303
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,171
This is bullshit. What do you want?

304
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,133
Tell me about Javier.

305
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,677
OK, in case you haven't heard, he's dead.

306
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:30,223
- I have heard. What else do you know?
- You were one of the last to talk to him.

307
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,893
Having a conversation with you
can be dangerous to one's health.

308
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,605
- Who had problems with Javier?
- I don't know.

309
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:41,151
I'm thinking I shouldn't give you more names
or they might end up dead too.

310
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:45,447
- You better give me something, Anton!
- I don't like you talking to me that way.

311
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:49,659
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you were such a high-class snitch.

312
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:54,414
No part of me needs this,
so why don't you just let me out of here?

313
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,708
- Not till I get some answers.
- Am I your prisoner?

314
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,420
Look, we have a deal! And I'm
not leaving until I get some information!

315
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:05,258
- I know what'll make you leave.
- What the fuck? Get rid of that.

316
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:10,096
Don't want anyone to know you came to the
men's room with your CI and lit up a joint.

317
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,391
- Fuckin' flush it.
- I can't flush this mama.

318
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,603
This is premium Island Lady.

319
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:20,940
- If you light that, I'll arrest you.
- Don't worry, there's more than enough.

320
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,943
I'll share.

321
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,414
I told you not to fucking do it!

322
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:50,470
It seems ironic that I,
an expert on human dismemberment,

323
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:54,224
have to pay $800
to have myself virtually dissected.

324
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:08,822
Check out this brain. This one belonged
to a serial killer executed last month.

325
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,740
Killed 11 women.

326
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,992
Then he really snapped.

327
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,663
Killed his wife, two kids
and the neighbor's dog.

328
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,415
Why are you showing me this?

329
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:22,502
Look how much smaller
the right hemisphere is.

330
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,588
This guy sure doesn't process
a lot of emotions, huh?

331
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,383
And you see all this activity
in the subcortex region?

332
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:32,137
That's where feelings of aggression
and violence come from.

333
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,722
- Why are you...
- Because, look.

334
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,561
It's exactly the same as your brain, Dex.

335
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,783
Freebo's final resting place.

336
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,494
How?

337
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,335
They dig the graves the day before,
they place a tarp over each one.

338
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,881
It wasn't that hard
to bring Freebo here late at night,

339
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:12,510
find an open grave to place his body in
and then to cover it up with a foot of dirt.

340
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:18,433
Then the next day they lower a 500-pound
casket on top of him, cover it all up with dirt.

341
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,144
Hiding a body in a cemetery.
You're fucking brilliant.

342
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,858
I'll just get a judge
to issue an exhumation order now,

343
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,194
- and then we...
- I need you to not do that.

344
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:33,740
I've never done this before. I don't
know what evidence I left on the body.

345
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,701
Hair and fibers...
I can't have it traced back to me.

346
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,329
Fair enough, fair enough.

347
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:45,919
It does leave us with our next little problem.

348
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,253
What is that?

349
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:51,257
Well, we still have someone out there
skinning and killing people.

350
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,177
- Yes, we do.
- Your homicide squad think it's Freebo.

351
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:57,555
They're wasting time and energy
looking for a dead man, when...

352
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,018
the real killer, whoever that might be,
is out there walking free.

353
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:06,689
- Well, how's that our problem?
- Because justice isn't being served.

354
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,650
Of course, of course.

355
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:12,654
We have to steer the police
in the right direction.

356
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,574
- How do we do this?
- I don't have a fucking clue.

357
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:21,704
But I've a feeling you're not going to
leave me alone until we figure this out.

358
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,248
Together.

359
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,251
What do you think about cowboys?

360
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,836
Uh...

361
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,382
Rugged American heroes?

362
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,594
- No, I meant for the baby's room.
- Oh.

363
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,888
Nice.

364
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,517
We can do something different if you want.

365
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:46,104
Yeah, cowboys are... fine.

366
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,700
Hey, are you ready to go to that yoga class?

367
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,202
Sure.

368
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,913
Astor! Cody! Come on, let's go.

369
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,806
Nathan Marten.

370
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:26,978
As the sun begins to set,
the lowly scavengers reveal themselves.

371
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,440
Hey, it's the Cheerios man.

372
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,194
- Who?
- The guy from the grocery store.

373
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:41,117
- What guy?
- The man who talked to me. Dexter knows.

374
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,370
Who is he?

375
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,499
He's no one to be concerned about.

376
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:54,797
Because in a land of predators,
a lion never fears the jackal.

377
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:03,890
And here we go into another warrior pose.

378
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,059
Feel your hips open up.

379
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:10,104
We are strong warriors.
All of us.

380
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,150
This is absolutely, without a doubt,
the worst moment of my life.

381
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:19,364
Now let's go into a little freeform yoga.
Just let yourself dance.

382
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,867
I was wrong. This is.

383
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:25,953
See the dust dancing against the sunlight.

384
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:33,378
Be as beautiful
as the golden flakes of dust, Dexter.

385
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,508
I could probably kill her
before anyone realized what happened.

386
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,344
Excellent.

387
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:46,140
Now I want all the partners
to turn and face their pregnant women.

388
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,893
Take your hand and place it on her belly.

389
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:56,067
And I want you to send all of your
positive intentions to your unborn baby.

390
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,322
I'm sorry.
I just don't want to hurt you.

391
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,425
Good morning, Mr. Prado.

392
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,386
Are you satisfied
with the sentencing of Chicky Hines?

393
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:27,849
I am. I pushed for the maximum
on this case, and I got it, and for just cause.

394
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:30,977
With Mr. Hines behind bars
for a very long time,

395
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:35,690
I'm hoping that the families of his victims
can finally find some peace. Thank you.

396
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,776
- Miguel.
- Maria.

397
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:43,364
- Another win for our team, huh?
- I have to admit, I'm a little confused.

398
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,283
What happened
with the witness I gave you?

399
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,161
I thought he had information
that exonerated Chicky Hines?

400
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,247
I reviewed his statement,
it just didn't add up.

401
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,918
I thought it at least merited
a conversation with him.

402
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,090
I see this kind of stuff all the time.
I know you do too.

403
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,470
Scumbags trying to play the system,
doing whatever they can to stay out of jail.

404
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,100
Um... Trust me on this one, hmm?

405
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,519
Ms. Wolf, do you have a statement?

406
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,231
I imagine Assistant District Attorney Prado
is going to go home now,

407
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:23,196
strip down to his American flag underwear
and pour himself a nice crime-fighting drink,

408
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:27,366
make a few fundraising phone calls
for his upcoming run for DA,

409
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:32,830
but the truth is, he just sent
an innocent man to prison for 20 years.

410
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:38,211
Ugh! He should be ashamed of himself.
It's despicable.

411
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,429
- Someone's gotta know who she is.
- No luck?

412
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:52,016
I'm thinking of putting
her picture on milk cartons.

413
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,188
- Not a bad idea.
- Except nobody would ever drink milk again.

414
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:07,782
- Why the fuck did you lock up my CI?
- Why do you keep calling him your CI?

415
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,036
Is there something you're not telling us?

416
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:16,082
You're very curious about me, aren't you?

417
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,000
Look at you, changing the subject.

418
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:24,215
Hey, Sarge. Um, can you ask
Officer Morgan why my CI's in lockup?

419
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,137
He was antagonistic.
He produced a joint.

420
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:33,140
I warned him not to light it
or I'd have to bust him.

421
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:38,145
He lit it. I knew I couldn't back down or
he'd never have to cooperate with me again.

422
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:39,981
He practically arrested himself.

423
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,651
That makes sense to me.
Got a problem with that?

424
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,736
- No.
- Good.

425
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,827
Cut him loose.

426
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:21,981
- Do I know you?
- We met at the grocery store the other day.

427
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,067
I don't recall.

428
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:29,155
You asked my girlfriend's daughter
to help you find the Cheerios.

429
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,073
Oh. Right, right, right.

430
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,076
- So what can I do for you?
- Shut the fuck up, Nathan.

431
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,247
- Stay away from my kids.
- What?

432
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,042
Sorry, buddy,
you got the wrong idea.

433
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:44,337
Saw you at the beach yesterday
with your camera.

434
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,673
I'm a photographer.
I always have a camera with me.

435
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,675
I know who you are.

436
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,637
I know what you are.

437
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,764
Once.

438
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:59,060
Once I made a horrible mistake
and I paid the price for it.

439
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:01,479
I did my time.

440
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,357
But I'm not like that anymore.

441
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:08,027
I learned my lesson.
I've changed.

442
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,905
You haven't changed.
It's impossible.

443
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,493
We are what we are.

444
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:26,754
Night. Good for the hunter.
Bad for the hunted.

445
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:32,468
Nathan Marten,
is your past the prologue to your future?

446
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,721
From the outside, he looks normal.

447
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:40,226
But like me, his brain is flawed and he
has a compulsion he's unable to control.

448
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,978
We're really not so different,
Nathan and I.

449
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,773
Except that I would never hurt a child.

450
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:49,068
Then again,
Nathan has never killed anyone.

451
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,112
Which means he doesn't fit my code.

452
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:55,783
I have other problems to deal with
besides Nathan.

453
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,630
Miguel Prado...

454
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,347
...and Teegan Campbell.

455
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,559
If I take care of one,
I take care of the other.

456
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,398
It's a new day in Miami.

457
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:30,276
Perfect time to help Deb help herself.

458
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,987
One of the things
that makes my sister a good cop

459
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,531
is that she's like a dog with a bone.

460
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:38,784
Once she's got her teeth into something,
she'll never let go.

461
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,078
All I have to do is lead her to the bone.

462
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,085
Hey, Papa!

463
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,004
Oh, hi.

464
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,256
Oh, God. Almost forgot.

465
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:58,262
- Isn’t it great?
- Nice.

466
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,599
Have you started thinking about names?

467
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,684
Not that I want to push it on you,

468
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,104
but if you have a girl,
Debra's a really good name.

469
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,858
- Deb, I should tell you...
- My God. What happened?

470
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,526
Nothing happened.

471
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:16,947
It's just I'm not sure
I'm going to be there to raise the baby.

472
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:19,825
What?

473
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,870
I don't know if I'm going
to be a father to the kid.

474
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,288
Ow!

475
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,373
Of course you are, you moron.

476
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,875
- Deb...
- Shut the fuck up!

477
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:31,086
How could you even say
you're not going to be a father to that kid?

478
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:36,133
I mean, where would you be without Harry?
And he wasn't even your biological father.

479
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,679
I just think I'm gonna be a lousy father.
I don't want to screw the kid up.

480
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:44,225
- Would you please stop doing that?
- Then stop saying stupid things!

481
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:51,732
I mean, first of all, who are we kidding?
You're gonna be a great father.

482
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:56,403
And second, and much more important,
big dumb brother of mine...

483
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,323
this isn't about you.

484
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,995
Who's it about?

485
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,040
The baby.

486
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,836
So it doesn't matter how scared you are,

487
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:15,548
how reluctant or unprepared you might feel,
the baby comes first.

488
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,258
And that baby needs you.

489
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:22,137
So you're just going
to have to set aside all...

490
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,600
Holy shit. That's my Jane Doe.

491
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,061
It's about time.

492
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,606
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, that's her. Teegan Campbell.

493
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:36,318
- It looks like her.
- Yeah, I gotta go, Dex. This is big.

494
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:42,491
- What's that for?
- I know you, Dex.

495
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:47,079
You're the best brother in the world,
and you can do this.

496
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,749
And if you don't trust yourself, trust me.

497
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,626
I'm the smart one in the family.

498
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,897
They look motivated.

499
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,609
- Anything?
- Claro. Once Morgan found out

500
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:20,279
that Jane Doe was Teegan Campbell,
it was a quick step to find her apartment.

501
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:23,365
- Guess who'd been hiding out there?
- Freebo. His shit was everywhere.

502
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,076
- All kinds of fresh fingerprint evidence.
- That's good.

503
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,163
Fucking guy's got an airtight alibi.
We checked the call logs.

504
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:33,125
Freebo called Abby Wilson 4 hours before
the estimated time of Teegan's murder.

505
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,002
- We followed up with Abby.
- But get this.

506
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,212
She's saying she spent
all day in bed with Freebo.

507
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:40,049
If that theory holds,
that means Freebo didn't kill Teegan.

508
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:44,303
And there are several calls from this phone
to Teegan's cell after she was killed.

509
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,598
Assuming Freebo made those calls,
he may not even know that she's dead.

510
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,309
We know Javier was killed
by the same person who killed Teegan,

511
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,977
so he's off the hook for that as well.

512
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,730
I was just telling Miguel
how we weren't giving up on Freebo.

513
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:57,816
Now I have to call him
and tell him he's probably right?

514
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,486
Freebo's probably long gone?

515
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,155
- Looks that way.
- ?Ay!

516
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,662
- What is that?
- Oh... Uh...

517
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:13,916
- You stuck a piece of chewing gum on it?
- I'm sorry.

518
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:17,795
This is a deliberate insult
against me and my people!

519
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:20,798
- Come on! Come on!
- Ass-wipe.

520
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,511
- Who the fuck are his people?
- I don't know.

521
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,430
Little scientists, I guess.

522
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:32,476
The lieutenant's right.
We're starting all over here.

523
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,354
We need to get out there
and see what we can shake loose.

524
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,356
We're looking at two cases now.

525
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:41,318
Ramos, liaison with tri-state PD
on the Freebo situation.

526
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,862
Quinn, Morgan, you stay on the Skinner.

527
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,448
And you need to mend fences with that Cl.

528
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:50,369
He's part of that world. We need
all the help we can get on this. OK?

529
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,913
Mm-hm.

530
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,961
Hey!

531
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,588
Lucky break, huh?
Seeing that flyer?

532
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,841
You make your own luck.

533
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,224
And now that I've dealt with Teegan...

534
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:18,355
- Yep?
- Hi, it's Dexter. Good news.

535
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,525
I was going to call you.
We need to meet.

536
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,403
Uh... OK.

537
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,823
Today, right after work.
Under the bridge near the beach club.

538
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,463
Hey, Dexter.

539
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:43,797
Miguel.

540
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,217
So you said on the phone
we have good news.

541
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,635
Yes.

542
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:52,639
It was just the other day
that I was stressing the importance

543
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:56,602
of getting the police off of the Freebo trail.

544
00:39:56,728 --> 00:40:02,858
And today, suddenly, I get the word
that the police have done exactly that.

545
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:09,323
I don't know how you did it, Dexter,
but I'm impressed.

546
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,909
Actually, it wasn't me at all.
It was my sister, Debra.

547
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,663
You're a little uneasy with compliments,
aren't you?

548
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,500
We all need to be liked.

549
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:24,129
I also notice that you always
have your guard up around me.

550
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:27,132
Oh, that's not true.

551
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,134
Ah, it's OK.

552
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,597
Actually, it's a good thing.
I appreciate that you're a cautious man.

553
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:39,269
It's actually a very valuable trait to have,
especially considering our circumstances.

554
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,979
It's just my nature.

555
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,441
I just want you to know,
you don't have to worry about me.

556
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,026
We're on the same side here.

557
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:51,573
Honestly, I try to avoid
taking sides in most situations.

558
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,493
There you go again, always being careful.

559
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,372
OK. Come on.

560
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,084
I got a gift for you.

561
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,710
A gift?

562
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:08,882
You know, when you took care of
my brother's murderer...

563
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,136
you gave me, uh, peace.

564
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:14,138
Now let me give you peace.

565
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:19,476
A shirt?

566
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:24,982
The shirt. This is the shirt I was wearing
when Freebo met his end.

567
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:33,740
That's his blood, right there.

568
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,079
This shirt implicates me in his death.

569
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,331
Accessory after the fact.

570
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:46,295
- Why?
- Because I trust you.

571
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,297
I trust you.

572
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,801
And I want you to trust me.

573
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,848
Same question. Why?

574
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,851
Because I like you.

575
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,688
I like working with you.

576
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,571
You're a good man, Dexter Morgan.

577
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:18,118
Potencial.
You got a lot of potential in you.

578
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:25,459
Sometimes I think that you are
the only one who doesn't know that.

579
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:29,463
So I'm gonna be seeing you again soon.
All right?

580
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,299
Yep. OK.

581
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:41,058
Is it possible I've actually made a friend?
Someone I can trust with my dark secrets?

582
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:44,519
Or am I being foolish
for even asking myself these questions?

583
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,655
Hey.

584
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:58,867
- Hey, if you've come to arrest me, I'm clean.
- I don't even have my cuffs.

585
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,703
Look... Anton...

586
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,288
I feel...

587
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,917
not good about what happened.

588
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,127
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

589
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:12,965
- Came on a little strong, didn't you?
- You kinda pushed me into it, didn't you?

590
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,926
Yeah, OK. I'll admit that.

591
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:21,223
All right, so, um... I feel...

592
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,891
not good too.

593
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,103
OK.

594
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:30,274
I've even been working on a song for you.

595
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,150
Kind of an apology.

596
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,529
- No fucking way!
- Yeah, yeah. Um...

597
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:36,947
It's, uh...

598
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,283
It's not done yet.

599
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:46,832
Hey, you.

600
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:51,295
Hey, Dexter. I was wondering
if you were coming by later tonight.

601
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:55,382
If I do, it'll be pretty late.
I've got some work stuff I gotta take care of.

602
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:59,511
Well, you think you could get a chance
to pick up some milk for the kids?

603
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,555
For their cereal in the morning.

604
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,641
I'll try to remember.

605
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:14,860
? Es una puta flaca mala

606
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:19,531
? Eso es exactamente lo que es

607
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,954
- ? Te va a dar por los cojones
- iAy!

608
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:31,168
? Y despu?s
? Te arrastrar?a la c?rcel

609
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,628
? Se reir?

610
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:36,673
? Por todo el camino

611
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,133
? De ti

612
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,844
? ?Por qu??

613
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,138
? Puta, flaca, mala

614
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,766
? Puta, flaca...
? iMala!

615
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,393
? Puta, flaca, mala...

616
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,563
- He wrote this for me!
- You're the puta mala flaca?

617
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:55,108
- Yeah, that's me.
- She's the skinny mean bitch!

618
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,362
? Puta flaca...
? iMala!

619
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,822
Hey!

620
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:10,082
So here I am again. Drawn to the
house of a man who doesn't meet the code.

621
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,185
But maybe there's another code.

622
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:36,942
A code that says,
"You've stepped uninvited into my world. "

623
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,990
And that's a place
where I decide who gets to live...

624
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:45,617
and who doesn't.

625
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,623
I am not like you!

626
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:10,851
Nobody hurts my children.

627
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:43,842
It's milk.

628
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,303
Thank you.

629
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,097
You're welcome.

630
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,189
So how was your day?

631
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:02,152
Um... Long.

632
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,573
- You?
- It was good.

633
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,536
Yeah, mine was good too.

634
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:16,374
Took care of some stuff... I needed to do.

635
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,797
Mm. That always feels nice.

636
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:42,901
Just sending out
my positive intentions to our baby.

637
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:05,590
So there it is.
I'm going to be a father, and raise my child.

638
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,135
It's what any good man would do.

639
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:11,429
After all...

640
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:16,059
it's a jungle out there.
